AB In shallow water acoustical environment, the propagation of radiated noise of complex structure is determined by the frequency responding properties, spatial directivity, seabed acoustic absorption and the stratification of the sound speed of water. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the propagated noise of complex structure in ocean acoustic environment. In this study, a shaft-hull system (SHS) is established based on the Suboff submarine, the coupled finite element / boundary element (FE/BE) method is adopted to acquire the source strength distribution of the structure, the ray-normal mode theory is used to obtain the sound field Green function in shallow waters, and the closed virtual impedance surface (CVIS) method is employed to eliminate the irregular frequency. On these bases, the radiated sound intensity level (SIL) is decomposed according to the coupling pattern of dry structural modes and sound field normal modes, and the smooth average sound energy is extracted of the radiated noise. It is found that: (1) the non -dimensional irregular frequency of Suboff hull can be estimated with fair precision with reference to the analytical expression of the irregular frequency of slender cylindrical shell (SCS) because the main structure of Suboff is an SCS; (2) the decaying smooth average properties of complex structures can be obtained by only considering the incoherent energy induced by identical sound field normal mode; (3) the far field decaying pattern of complicated structures is approximately similar to that of a monopole source in shallow sea with a soft seabed.

AB The continuous heating of the Earth's surface and aerosphere causes global warming. Recent developments predict that at the end of the twenty-first century, with 3 degrees C on average global warming will yield a regional augmentation in the probability of the abnormally large precipitation accumulation in a single downpour event. We examine this issue using a stochastic climate model and provide a theoretical scheme to the increased possibility of cloudburst in a single rainfall event. We find that implementing a permanent upper cut-off in column integrated water vapour or an asymmetric stochastic resetting can reduce the abnormally high accumulation probability of such rainstorms. We report that an optimum upper limit of column integrated water vapour in the atmosphere ascertain the decrease in the heavy precipitation-accumulation. The presence of such a perpetual upper ceiling in the moisture content is energy exorbitant and can significantly affect the mean downpour. A careful choice of the system parameters ensures the decrease in mean accumulation size within a ten per cent tolerance limit. We introduce an asymmetric stochastic resetting to the amount of column integrated water vapour at its upper threshold to recompense the energy cost. We perceive that an adaptive restart rate is efficient enough to reduce the probability of targeted precipitation accumulation to the desired extent.

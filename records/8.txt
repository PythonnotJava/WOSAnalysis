AB As government policies of energy resources shift towards the inclusion of renewable energy, the ocean resources have become great potential. One of the ocean energies is tidal current energy which can be used to drive underwater turbine and generator. A study on harvesting ocean is done in this integrated project with six subprojects which are investigated by the researchers of cross-disciplinary including mechanical, electrical, ocean, environmental engineering, underwater technology and marine science. The horizontal-axis turbine is attached to a magnetic generator and is installed in a square nozzle and diffusor duct which is semi-submerged and floated. The floating capture system is mooring by steel chains and the anchoring system is concrete gravity blocks. The deployment of the first NSYSU energy capture system is made in 2013 at Penghu Island and the system was safety approved in storm wave condition since it was passed by Teinping Typhoon attacked. A maximum power take off (PTO) nearly equal to 5 kW is monitored which is the largest tidal current PTO in Taiwan and also is the first on site successful ocean deployment in Taiwan.

FX This study is partially supported by a grant issued by National Science
   Council of Taiwan with grant numbers NSC 100-3113-E-110-002 and NSC
   101-3113-E-110-003. We would like to thank Prof. Wang Li of NCKU in the
   early involvement of the project and all the research assistants (such
   as Chih-hua Wu, Hsin-Hua Pang, I-Lun Ho, Wen-Rui Tang among more than 20
   RAs) involved in the project. We also missed the pass away of our
   colleague Prof. Jiang who was in charge of the analysis and design of
   the PMSG.

AB To maximize the utilization of ocean resources, shorten the return period of investment and directly supply energy to the fishing cage, this paper performs a preliminary study for a state-of-the-art concept integrating a floating offshore wind turbine with a fishing cage. An octagonal semisubmersible rigid fishing cage with a slack catenary mooring system is designed to match the NREL 5 MW offshore baseline wind turbine. Combined with the blade pitch controller, fully coupled aero-hydro-elastic-servo-mooring simulations are performed through FAST and AQWA to explore the dynamic performance of the integrated system. Free decay conditions, uniform wind with irregular and regular waves, and turbulent wind with irregular waves are tested. The results showed that the integrated system works normally at the operating conditions and exhibits different dynamic characteristics for various scenarios. Additionally, the study on the influence of mooring line length indicates that the increasing line length can significantly affect the cage surge motion and the maximum and mean values of the upwind line tension at fairlead. Specifically, the maximum surge motion with a 924-m-long line is 404.8% larger than that with an 880-m-long line. When the line length increases by 5%, the maximum and mean line tensions decrease by 45.7% and 47.7%, respectively, while when the line length increases by 10%, the maximum and mean line tension decrease by 52.9% and 54.2%, respectively. It should be noted that the main purpose of this work is to conduct a preliminary study on this integrated system, aiming to provide an idea for the conceptual design, modeling and simulation analysis of this integrated system.

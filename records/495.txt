AB As changes to Earth's polar climate accelerate, the need for robust, long-term sea ice thickness observation datasets for monitoring those changes and for verification of global climate models is clear. By linking an algorithm for retrieving snow-ice interface temperature from passive microwave satellite data to a thermodynamic sea ice energy balance relation known as Stefan's law, we have developed a retrieval method for estimating thermodynamic sea ice thickness growth from space: Stefan's Law Integrated Conducted Energy (SLICE). With an initial condition at the beginning of the sea ice growth season, the method can model basin-wide absolute sea ice thickness by combining the one-dimensional SLICE retrieval with an ice motion dataset. The advantages of the SLICE retrieval method include daily basin-wide coverage, lack of atmospheric reanalysis product input requirement, and a potential for use beginning in 1987. Validation of the retrieval against measurements from 10 ice mass balance buoys shows a mean correlation of 0.89 and a mean bias of 0.06 m over the course of an entire sea ice growth season. Despite its simplifications and assumptions relative to models like the Pan-Arctic Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS), basin-wide SLICE performs nearly as well as PIOMAS when compared against CryoSat-2 and Operation IceBridge using a linear correlation between collocated points.

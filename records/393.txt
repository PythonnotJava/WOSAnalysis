AB Morocco has experienced several years of drought, conventional water resources were insufficient to meet the needs of the population, which prompted the kingdom to seek other resources to ensure the supply of drinking water to this population. The most suitable solution was the desalination of seawater. In this context, the design and investigation of concentrated solar power (CSP) plant integrated with a desalination unit in Morocco are presented in this paper. The CSP part consists of a parabolic trough technology with a two-tank storage system, integrated with a power block of 111 MWe gross consisting of a conventional Rankine cycle. As for the desalination part, it consists of a Direct Contact Membrane Distillation System (DCMD) based on heat and mass transfer equations, and is solved numerically by MATLAB environment; the model was validated by means of the experimental data. The results show that the large-scale Parabolic Trough Collector (PTC) plants are more competitive in Dakhla -southern Morocco- where the annual energy generation and the capacity factor were estimated to be 493.8 GWh, and 47.6%, respectively. Whereas, the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) is 10.63c;/kWh. Furthermore, it has been found that in the DCMD system, an increase in the feed water temperature leads to an increase in permeate flux. Besides, freshwater production is highest in winters for Dakhla and Agadir (Atlantic Ocean) and it is highest in summers for Saidia and Al Hoceima (Mediterranean Sea). The lowest freshwater production cost is 0.84$/m(3) in Dakhla, followed by 0.98$/m(3) in Saidia, with the highest production cost at 1.20$/m(3) in Agadir.

AB This paper investigates an efficient transmission scheme for the remote wireless sensors to receive information which is rarely discussed in the integrated remote wireless sensor and multibeam satellite networks (IWSMSNs). The networks can be employed to exchange sensing information for emergency scenario, ocean scenario, and so on, which are isolated from available terrestrial networks. As the efficient transmission link is important to the IWSMSNs, we propose a hybrid full frequency (HFF) precoding by taking advantage of frequency reuse and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) precoding. Considering energy efficiency and sinks fairness are crucial to transmission link, thus the HFF precoding problems are formulated as transmit power minimization (TPM) and max-min fair (MMF) received signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) problems, which can be transformed to indefinite quadratic optimization programs. Then this paper presents a semi-definite programming (SDP) algorithm to solve the problems for the IWSMSNs. The promising potential of HFF for the real IWSMSNs is demonstrated through simulations.

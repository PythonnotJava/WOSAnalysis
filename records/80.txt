AB Offshore renewable energy technologies offer a promising prospect for energy supply on offshore islands. However, traditional wind and solar energy sources exhibit strong variability and cannot fully meet the energy demands of users. At the same time, the energy demand of users also has great volatility, so the supply side and demand side of energy cannot match well. Existing renewable energy systems often utilize thermal power generation as a stabilizer for the system, however, this approach is difficult to apply in offshore conditions. This study introduces an innovative multi-energy complementary system that integrates seawater freezing desalination, refrigeration and power-hydrogen-ammonia co-generation, driven by ocean thermal energy, wind energy, and solar energy. The system incorporates the use of a new developed small temperature difference ejector refrigeration cycle to stabilize the entire system and produce low-temperature refrigeration. By utilizing the seawater freezing desalination process to minimize energy conversion losses and balancing fluctuations in multiple energy inputs and user demands through ammonia-hydrogen co-production, this approach effectively minimizes energy waste, enhances energy utilization efficiency, and reduces excess power handling. The purpose is to optimize the configuration of the energy conversion subsystem within the multi-energy complementary multi-effect co-generation system, thus improving the economic feasibility and reliability of the system in providing energy and freshwater supply, ultimately achieving the goals of reducing energy waste, achieving high conversion efficiency, and minimizing equipment investment. This study conducts an economic analysis and optimization of a multi-energy complementary system, utilizing a 2 MW-level OTEC subsystem as a stabilizer. Both equipment investment and operating costs are considered in the economy analysis. The carbon emission reduction performance of this system is evaluated. The performance optimization results show that the system achieves an energy storage efficiency of 65.96 %, and the curtailment rate of this system is only 3.99 %, significantly lower than the 10 % curtailment rate in traditional system. The proposed system can meet the annual electricity demand of 33.09 million kWh, as well as a cooling demand of 546.81 million kWh. Under typical conditions, the ocean thermal energy conversion cycle exhibits a power efficiency of 0.85 % and a refrigeration efficiency of 29.10 %. Meanwhile, it annually reduces CO2 emissions by 2.54 million tons, demonstrating significant environmental benefits. This proposed system is mainly applicable to tropical waters with high surface water temperatures and depths of no less than 600 m worldwide. This study offers a practical and economically beneficial solution for energy and freshwater supply on offshore islands.

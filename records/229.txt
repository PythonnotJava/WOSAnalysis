AB High-resolution modelling systems have increasingly become an essential requirement to investigate ocean dynamics over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, and to integrate the punctual ocean observations. When applied in coastal areas, they also have the potential to provide a detailed representation of transport and exchange processes at the sub-basin scale. This paper presents a validation exercise between the surface fields generated by the regional ocean modeling system (ROMS), developed for the Tyrrhenian Sea and downscaled for the Gulf of Naples (GNAM Gulf of Naples advanced model), and a 4 year-long (2009-2012) record of high-frequency radar (HFR) data. The comparison between hourly and seasonal model results and HFR surface fields is focused on the Gulf of Naples (GoN), where an observational network of three HFR sites has been operational since 2004, and on a specific subdomain characterized by the presence of the Sarno river, a long-term ecological research station (LTER-MC) and one important canyon area. An evaluation on a transect delimiting inshore-offshore zones in the GoN is also presented. The GNAM model was also compared with in situ hydrological parameters of temperatures and salinities retrieved at the LTER-MC fixed monitoring station. According to the skill metrics, basic circulation features are accurately reproduced by the circulation model, despite some model drawbacks in terms of increment of energy content in the surface current field occurring during specific seasonal events. The results allow us to identify potential model errors and to suggest useful improvements, the outcome also confirms the unique capability of HF radar systems to provide fine-scale measurements for the validation of numerical models and to counterbalance the lack of high-resolution measurements in coastal areas.

AB Internal wave-driven mixing is an important factor in the balance of heat and salt fluxes in the polar regions of the ocean. Transformation of internal waves at the edge of the ice cover can enhance the mixing and melting of ice in the Arctic Ocean and Antarctica. In the polar oceans, internal solitary waves (ISWs) are generated by various sources, including tidal currents over bottom topography, the interaction of ice keels with tides, time-varying winds, vortices, and lee waves. In this study, a numerical investigation of the transformation of ISWs propagating from open water in the stratified sea under the edge of the ice cover is carried out to compare the depression ISW transformation and loss of energy on smooth ice surfaces, including those on the ice shelf and glacier outlets, with the processes beneath the ridged underside of the ice. They were carried out using a non-hydrostatic model that is based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations in the Boussinesq approximation for a continuously stratified fluid. The Smagorinsky turbulence model extended for stratified fluid was used to describe the small-scale turbulent mixing explicitly. Two series of numerical experiments were carried out in an idealized 2D setup. The first series aimed to study the processes of the ISWs of depression transformation under an ice cover of constant submerged ice thickness. Energy loss was estimated based on a budget of depth-integrated pseudoenergy before and after the wave transformation. The transformation of ISWs of depressions is controlled by the blocking parameter beta , which is the ratio of the minimum thickness of the upper layer under the ice cover to the incident wave amplitude. The energy loss was relatively small for large positive and large negative values of beta . The maximal value of energy loss was about 38 %, and it was reached at beta approximate to 0 for ISWs. In the second series of experiments, a number of keels were located on the underside of the constant-thickness ice layer. The ISW transformation under ridged ice also depends on the blocking parameter beta . For large keels ( beta < 0 ), more than 40 % of energy is lost on the first keel, while for relatively small keels ( beta > 0.3 ), the losses on the first keel are less than 6 %. Energy losses due to all keels depend on the distance between them, which is characterized by the parameter mu , i.e. the ratio of keel depth to the distance between keels. In turn, for a finite length of the ice layer, the distance between keels depends on the keel quantity.

AB A new approach to rotational speed control structures based on an optimized intelligent recurrent wavelet-based Elman neural network (RWENN) controller used for the integration of offshore wind and wave energy conversion systems driven by a doubly fed induction generator. The nodes connecting the weights of the RWENN are trained online using a backpropagation method. A modified gravitational search algorithm (MGSA) is developed to adjust the learning rates and improve learning capability. The proposed control scheme has improved the real power regulation and dynamic performance of a combined wind and ocean wave energy scheme over a wide range of operating conditions. The performance of this control scheme is assessed by comparing it to a traditional proportional-integral based control scheme in a series of case studies representative of maximum power generation. Simulations are carried out using PSCAD/EMTDC software to verify the robustness of the power electronics converters and the efficiency of the proposed controller under steady state and transient conditions.

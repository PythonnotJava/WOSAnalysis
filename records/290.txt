AB Ship voyage optimization provides key theoretical and technical insights for efficient shipping operations. It is critical for developing methodologies and systems that bridge the gaps between the perceived expectations of stakeholders and actual ship operations and for truly applying primary principles and fundamental practices in maritime operations. To develop an advanced and effective shipping voyage optimization system, it is necessary to investigate thoroughly the factors affecting fuel consumption and integrate wisely other aspects, including cargo operation, emissions from fuel consumption, and emission control regulations. The literature on ship voyage optimization is flourishing with the development of green maritime transportation. This paper carefully reviews the latest articles on emission control-driven voyage optimization to investigate the state-of-art and further identify research gaps, ongoing topics, and future research trends.

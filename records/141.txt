AB The incorporation of energy storage directly into the distribution system of a Navy ship can enable new dynamic high-power loads and improve overall energy efficiency. This article investigates the integration of energy storage onboard an all-electric destroyer by designing a solution for an advanced combination of loads and establishing a procedure for incorporating energy storage directly into the distribution system design. A case study is examined, in which a battery is sized for a defined load and integrated into a ship design with associated peripherals. The selected battery is simulated to verify expected performance. The study investigates a battery-based system that provides peak shaving to assist the traditional generation system in supplying pulsed and stochastic loads, while also enabling single-generator operations. Such an energy storage system provides notable benefits in terms of fuel consumption during normal operations while also guaranteeing a stable and continuous power supply to the mission loads during battle scenarios.

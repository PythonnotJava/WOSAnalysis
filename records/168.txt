AB In the development of ocean energy technologies, full-scale sea trials have proven technically challenging and expensive. As a contribution to the development of flexible, reliable, and affordable measurement systems for such sea trials, this paper presents and evaluates a portable data acquisition system. The system offers a cheap and flexible option for when and where signal infrastructure at site is not available. It is battery powered and consists of a sensor system and a logger unit. The sensor system is placed inside the object of study, which for this application is a wave power generator standing on the seafloor. The logger unit, which contains a logger with integrated data storage and a battery, is placed outside the object of study in a submersible and retrievable vessel. Sensor output is carried with 4-20-mA current signals between the sensor system and the logger, which makes the system directly compatible with a wide range of industrial sensors. For the specific setup implemented in this paper, the sensor system was used to measure voltage and current inside the generator. Beyond this, the system is designed to be adaptable for a wider range of sensors, with 16 individual signals and a sampling frequency up to 1 kHz. The custom logger is programmable and offers many options to apply different logging schedules and to limit the sensor system power supply accordingly. Evaluations show that the implemented system offers 5-22 weeks of 1-kHz and 16-bmonitoring of 16 signals, depending on a chosen logging schedule. Suggestions are also given for how to raise the operation time up to 50 weeks. The system has been tested offshore for the collection of power production data from two wave energy converters, with good results.

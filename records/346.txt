AB In this study, we compare the Energy Exascale Earth Systems Model (E3SM) multiscale modeling framework (MMF) with the cloud resolving model (CRM) configured in two (2dMMF) and three (3dMMF) dimensions. We explore how CRM dimensionality impacts the representation of mean and extreme precipitation characteristics. Our results show that tropical mean precipitation patterns are better represented in 3dMMF compared to observations (Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrivals for GPM and Global Precipitation Climatology Project One Degree Daily products), while 2dMMF better captures extreme precipitation intensity, with systematic land-ocean differences in precipitation and cloud-associated variables. These differences are attributed to the co-occurrence of CRM throttling (i.e., suppressed convection in due to smaller numbers of CRM columns and domain size) and dilution (i.e., 3-D cloud circulations with increased entrainment and lower precipitation efficiency) effects. Overall, throttling results in more low-level humidity in 2dMMF and dilution contributes to more high clouds with less precipitation efficiency in 3dMMF. Since throttling occurs more strongly over the ocean than land, the 3dMMF tends to have less cloud liquid and precipitation over the ocean and more cloud ice and precipitation over land. These results may serve as a guide for choosing the CRM structure to reduce precipitation and cloud-related biases.

ID RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB This research focuses on the development and optimization of a wave-driven electromagnetic energy harvester designed to efficiently capture and store energy from low-frequency ocean waves (<0.3 Hz). The harvester configuration was optimized by adjusting the number of levitating magnets and fixed base magnets to enhance energy conversion. Experiments simulating a sine wave 0.2 Hz demonstrated successfully induced output voltage ranging from 2 to 4 V. This study in magnetic configuration led to observable variations in induced voltage as the repulsive interaction changed between the levitating magnets and base magnets. Performance was evaluated across a range of frequencies (0.05 Hz - 0.3 Hz) to assess the harvester's adaptability to variable wave conditions. To facilitate energy storage, a rectifier and capacitor were integrated into the system, converting and storing the harvested AC energy as DC, allowing the system to store 2.8 V within 5 minutes. Experimental results demonstrate efficient energy harvesting, highlighting the potential for this technology in low-power marine applications. (c) 2025 Author(s).

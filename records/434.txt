AB Surface current mapping high-frequency radars were installed along the northwest corner of Alaska during the open water periods of 2011-2013. A combination of wind and solar renewable energy inputs supplied electricity to single radar site operating at Point Barrow, Alaska, via an off-grid remote power module (RPM) The radar at Point Bar-row was able to simultaneously collect measurements of ocean surface currents, measure the position and velocity of passing vessels, and provide meteorological data in real time. This paper provides a summary of the performance of the power module from 2011 to 2013 and vessel detection results from 2013 with corresponding Automated Identification System (AIS) data. The RPM provided infrastructure to meteorological stations, high frequency radars and AIS in a resilient and robust manner and serves as an example of how the multi-use capability of integrated sensor modules can provide enhanced maritime domain awareness and persistent surveillance capabilities in remote Arctic environments.

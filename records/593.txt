AB Elasticity is one of the most fundamental mechanical properties of solid. In high-throughput design of advanced materials, there is an imperative demand for the capability to quickly calculate and screen a massive pool of candidate structures. A fully automatized pipeline with minimal human intervention is the key to provide high efficiency to achieve the goal. Here, we introduce a tool-kit MyElas that aims to address this problem by forging all pre-processing, elastic constant and other related property calculations, and post-processing into an integrated framework that automatically performs the assigned tasks to drive data flowing through parallelized pipelines from input to output. The core of MyElas is to calculate the second and third order elastic constants of a solid with the energy-strain method from first-principles. MyElas can auto-analyze the elastic constants, to derive other related physical quantities. Furthermore, the tool-kit also integrates a visualization function, which can, for example, plot the spatial anisotropy of elastic modulus and sound velocity of monocrystalline. The validity and efficiency of the toolkit are tested and bench-marked on several typical systems. Program summary Program title: MyElas CPC Library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /jbz2s9xsmv.1 Code Ocean capsule: https://codeocean .com /capsule /4149434 Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License 3 Programming language: Python 3.X External routines/libraries: Numpy [1], Spglib [2], Matplotlib [3] Nature of problem: Through the first-principal calculation, the second-order and third-order elastic constants of solid materials are automatically calculated, and the post-processing and visualization of single crystal and polycrystalline physical properties are carried out. Solution method: Firstly, the required strain structure is automatically generated through the space group of materials and the corresponding strain matrix. Secondly, the energy of the structure is calculated by first-principles calculation software such as VASP [4]. Thirdly, the relationship between energy and strain is polynomial fitted to deduce the elastic constant of the material. Fourth, automatically derive the relevant physical properties. Finally, the distribution of mechanical modulus and sound velocity in spherical space is visualized. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: Many modules of the software can be embedded into other software through simple modification, such as visualization module. The software supports finite temperature calculation with electronic temperature. In addition, the software supports the derivation of corresponding elastic constants from phonon spectrum data generated by Phonopy [5], Alamode [6] and TDEP [7] software through long-wave limit approximation and Christoffel equation.

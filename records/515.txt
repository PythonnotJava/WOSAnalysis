AB Integrating behavior and physiology is critical to formulating new hypotheses on the evolution of animal life-history strategies. Migratory capital breeders acquire most of the energy they need to sustain migration, gestation, and lactation before parturition. Therefore, when predicting the impact of environmental variation on such species, a mechanistic understanding of the physiology of their migratory behavior is required. Using baleen whales as a model system, we developed a dynamic state variable model that captures the interplay among behavioral decisions, energy, reproductive needs, and the environment. We applied the framework to blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) in the eastern North Pacific Ocean and explored the effects of environmental and anthropogenic perturbations on female reproductive success. We demonstrate the emergence of migration to track prey resources, enabling us to quantify the trade-offs among capital breeding, body condition, and metabolic expenses. We predict that periodic climatic oscillations affect reproductive success less than unprecedented environmental changes do. The effect of localized, acute anthropogenic impacts depended on whales' behavioral response to the disturbance; chronic, but weaker, disturbances had little effect on reproductive success. Because we link behavior and vital rates by modeling individuals' energetic budgets, we provide a general framework to investigate the ecology of migration and assess the population consequences of disturbance, while identifying critical knowledge gaps.

FX This research was developed in association with the Office of Naval
   Research (ONR)-supported Population Consequences of Acoustic
   Disturbance/Population Consequences of Disturbance working group and by
   ONR grant N00014-08-1-1195, the E&P Sound and Marine Life Joint Industry
   Project of the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers.
   J.A.G. was supported by funding from the ONR Young Investigator Program
   (award N00014-16-1-2477). We acknowledge the field crews, the research,
   and the administrative staff at the Oregon State University (OSU) Marine
   Mammal Institute for their support of blue whale tagging and telemetry
   data collection. These activities were conducted under authorization of
   the National Marine Fisheries Service Marine Mammal Protection
   Act/Endangered Species Act (research/enhancement permits 4495, 841, 369
   -1440, 369-1757, and 14856) and the OSU Institutional Animal Care and
   Use Committee (permit 4495). Funding for these activities came from the
   Tagging of Pacific Pelagics program, the ONR, the National Science
   Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the Moore Foundation, the
   Packard Foundation, and the National Geographic Society, with additional
   contributions from dozens of private donor gifts to the Marine Mammal
   Institute. We would also like to thank Ian Jonsen for suggestions on
   data analysis, as well as Jean Potvin, Elliott Hazen, and the OSU
   analytical team (Ladd Irvine, Barbara Lagerquist, Martha Winsor, and
   Tomas Follett) for useful discussions on the structure of the model and
   value of the parameters. The manuscript greatly benefited from inputs
   and comments of Editor-in-Chief Judith Bronstein, Associate Editor
   Jurgen Groeneveld, and two anonymous reviewers. Finally, we thank Emer
   Rogan and University College Cork for providing office space to E. P.

AB Ocean wave energy is one of the most promising clean and renewable energy sources, so developing effective methods to collect such ?random? and ultra-low frequency energy is indispensable. The invention of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) provides new prospects for large-scale blue energy harvesting. In this work, a new spherical TENG based on the coupling of spring-assisted structure and swing structure, integrated with a charge excitation circuit (CEC), was constructed to scavenge water wave energy. The particular structure can transform low-frequency water wave vibrations to high-frequency motions, elevating the frequencies of electrical outputs. Moreover, a TENG array consisting of four TENGs with CECs was fabricated, exhibiting a maximum output power of 16.6 mW and a 205 times enhanced output current of 23.3 mA. The charge excitation TENG array was demonstrated to successfully power a digital thermometer and a wireless signal transmission and reception system without any external power supply. Our study not only provides a new type of TENG with improved performance, but also offers a strategy for constructing maritime internet of things (IoTs) system.

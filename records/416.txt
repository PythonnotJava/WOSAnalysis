AB A global prognostic model based on MOM4p1, which is a primitive equation nonBoussinesq numerical model, has been integrated with 1 400 years from the state of rest based on the realistic topography to study the long-term pattern of combined wind-driven and thermodynamically-driven general circulation. The model is driven by monthly climatological mean forces and includes 192 x 189 horizontal grids and 31 pressure-based vertical levels. The main objective is to investigate the mass and heat transports at interbasin passages and their compensations and roles in the global ocean circulation under equilibrium state of long-term spin up. The kinetic energy analysis divides the spin up process into three stages: the quasi-stable state of wind driven current, the growing phase of thermodynamical circulation and the equilibrium state of thermohaline circulation. It is essential to spin up over a thousand years in order to reach the thermohaline equilibrium state from a state of rest. The Arctic Throughflow from the Bering Strait to the Greenland Sea and the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) are captured and examined with their compensations and existing data. Analysis reveals that the slope structures of sea surface height are the dynamical driving mechanism of the Pacific-Arctic-Atlantic throughflow and ITF. The analysis denotes, in spite of O (1.4 x 10(6) m(3)/s) of the southward volume transport in the northern Atlantic, that there is still O (1 PW) of heat transported northward since the northward currents in the upper layer carry much higher temperature water than the southward flowing northern Atlantic deep water (NADW). Meridional volume and heat transports are focused on the contributions to NADW renewals and Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). Quantitative descriptions of the interbasin exchanges are explained by meridional compensations and supported by previous observations and numerical modeling results. Analysis indicates that the volume and heat exchanges on the interbasin passages proposed in this article manifest their hub roles in the Great Ocean Conveyor System.

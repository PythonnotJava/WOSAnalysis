AB The current Earth's energy imbalance (EEI) can best be estimated from changes in ocean heat content (OHC), complemented by top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiation measurements and an assessment of the small non-ocean components. Sustained observations from the Argo array of autonomous profiling floats enable near-global estimates of OHC since 2005, which reveal considerable cancellation of variations in the upper 300 m. An analysis of the monthly contributions to EEI from non-ocean components (land and ice) using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Large Ensemble reveals standard deviations of 0.3-0.4 W m(-2) (global); largest values occur in August, but values are below 0.75 W m(-2) greater than 95% of the time. Global standard deviations of EEI of 0.64 W m(-2) based on top-of-atmosphere observations therefore substantially constrain ocean contributions, given by the tendencies of OHC. Instead, monthly standard deviations of many Argo-based OHC tendencies are 6-13 W m(-2), and nonphysical fluctuations are clearly evident. It is shown that an ocean reanalysis with multivariate dynamical data assimilation features much better agreement with TOA radiation, and 44% of the vertically integrated short-term OHC trend for 2005-14 of 0.8 +/- 0.2 W m(-2) (globally) occurs below 700-m depth. Largest warming occurs from 20 degrees to 50 degrees S, especially over the southern oceans, and near 40 degrees N in all ocean analyses. The EEI is estimated to be 0.9 +/- 0.3 W m(-2) for 2005-14.

AB Large-scale floating photovoltaics (FPV) are garnering increased attention as a sustainable solution for renewable energy production and efficient utilization of ocean spaces. These FPV arrays are predominantly deployed in shallow water environments, which present significant challenges in mooring system design due to substantial tidal fluctuations. In such settings, mooring systems may become slack and lose functionality at low tide or risk damage from excessive stiffness at high tide. The primary aim of this study is to develop a mooring system tailored to FPV arrays, capable of withstanding extensive tidal variations without causing damage to the floating modules due to high mooring line tension. Employing HydroD, a hydrodynamic analysis tool based on potential flow theory, alongside OrcaFlex, a time-domain coupled analysis tool predicated on the lumped mass method, we conducted a comparative assessment of six distinct mooring configurations. These configurations, varying in mooring line materials and components, were evaluated from static, dynamic, and fatigue analysis standpoints across a range of tidal levels. The results indicate that taut mooring systems integrated with buoys or clumps consistently exhibit superior performance in all test scenarios. Accordingly, these systems are highly recommended for securing FPV arrays in shallow water environments characterized by severe tidal variations, offering optimal stability and resilience.

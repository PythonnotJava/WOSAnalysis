AB Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) systems have been demonstrated to generate power with high density. However, the electrical output power obtained from wave energy harvesting using TENG systems is typically limited to several milliwatts. To address this limitation and support various ocean buoy systems, an efficient method to scale-up TENG systems is required. In this paper, we present a self-powered ocean buoy (SPOB) incorporating a disk-type, soft-contact, mechanical frequency regulator TENG (DSMFR-TENG). The mechanical frequency regulator (MFR) enables the conversion of low-frequency wave energy to high-speed mechanical rotation, facilitating high power generation with the disk-type TENG. The SPOB was tested in a wave tank, reaching a peak power output of 470 mW and an average power output of 130 mW after the MFR released the rotational energy. To further enhance the functionality of the buoy, the DSMFR-TENG and a microcontroller, temperature sensor, and acoustic transmitter were integrated with the SPOB. The acoustic transmitter successfully transmitted signals 7, 23, and 30 times over a one-minute period at wave frequencies of 0.33 Hz, 0.5 Hz, and 1 Hz, respectively, thereby demonstrating the power supply capability of the TENG system for ocean buoys.

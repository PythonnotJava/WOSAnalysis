AB The rapid expansion in miniaturization, usability, energy efficiency, and affordability of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, integrated with innovations in smart capability, is greatly increasing opportunities in ground-level monitoring of ecosystems at a specific scale using sensor grids. Surrounding sound is a powerful data source for investigating urban and non-urban ecosystem health, and researchers commonly use robust but expensive passive sensors as monitoring equipment to capture it. This paper comprehensively describes the hardware behind our low-cost, small multipurpose prototype, capable of monitoring different environments (e.g., remote locations) with onboard processing power. The device consists of a printed circuit board, microprocessor, local memory, environmental sensor, microphones, optical sensors and LoRa (Long Range) communication systems. The device was successfully used in different use cases, from monitoring mosquitoes enhanced with optical sensors to ocean activities using a hydrophone.

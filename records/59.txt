AB This study proposes the integrated designs of energy systems and a re-liquefaction system for ocean-going LH2 tankers. Five prospective energy systems (Systems A to E) are suggested, using LNG as fuel, and a re-liquefaction system with a Claude cycle is developed. Their economic value, technological feasibility, and environmental impact are evaluated. The re-liquefaction systems' exergy efficiency and specific energy consumption ranges were 26.79-46.27% and 3-7.45 kWh/kg, respectively. The re-liquefaction system in System C is economically feasible up to $2/kg of H2. LCC of the integrated designs shows that System C has the lowest cost of $140 million. The shipping costs for each design are reviewed, and the lowest one is $447/ton of H2 for System C. Although System C CAPEX is the second expensive, it has the highest efficiency. Consequently, System C with the lowpressure engine, SOFC, and the re-liquefaction system is determined to be the optimal one. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Internal Solitary Waves (ISWs) play a pivotal role in transporting energy and matter within the ocean and also pose substantial risks to ocean engineering, navigation, and underwater communication systems. Consequently, measures need to be adopted to alleviate their negative effects and minimize linked risks. An effective method entails extracting ISW positions from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for precise trajectory prediction and efficient avoidance strategies. However, manual extraction of ISWs from SAR data is time-consuming and prone to inaccuracies. Hence, it is imperative to develop a high-precision, rapid, and automated ISW-extraction algorithm. In this paper, we introduce Middle Transformer U-2-net (MTU2-net), an innovative model that integrates a distinctive loss function and Transformer to improve the accuracy of ISWs' extraction. The novel loss function enhances the model's capacity to extract bow waves, whereas the Transformer ensures coherence in ISW's patterns. By conducting experiments involving 762 image scenes, incorporating ISWs, from the South China Sea, we established a standardized dataset. The Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) achieved on this dataset was 71.57%, surpassing the performance of other compared methods. The experimental outcomes showcase the remarkable performance of our proposed model in precisely extracting bow wave attributes from SAR data.

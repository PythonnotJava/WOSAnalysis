AB Aqueous batteries, particularly those integrating organic active materials functioning in a neutral pH environment, stand out as highly promising contenders in the stationary electrochemical storage domain, owing to their unparalleled safety, sustainability, and low-cost materials. Herein, a novel di-block oligomer, serving as the negative electrode of an all-organic aqueous battery, is shown to offer exceptional output capabilities. The battery's performance is further enhanced by a unique intermixed p/n-type storage mechanism, which is able to simultaneously exchange light and naturally abundant Na+, Mg2+, and Cl-. Reaching up to 105 mAh g(-1), this system shows remarkable capacity retention for several thousand cycles (6500 cycles, approximate to 40 days) in various neutral electrolytes, including raw ocean water (approximate to 3000 cycles, approximate to 75 days). The surprisingly fast kinetics of this di-block oligomer allow to attain an unmatched specific capacity of near to 60 mAh g(electrode)(-1) while entirely devoid of conducting additives, and more than 80 mAh g(electrode)(-1) with 10% carbon additive, as well as displaying an areal capacity as high as 3.4 mAh cm(-2) at C rate. Full cell validation was demonstrated over 1600 cycles by virtue of a commercial 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO) molecule, which permitted an energy density of close to 40 Wh kg(materials)(-1) at C rate in a self-pH-buffered and inexpensive aqueous electrolyte.

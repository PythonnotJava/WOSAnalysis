AB In the field of isolated island energy supply, the OTEC system is considered promising due to its large storage capacity, and pollution-free characteristics. To improve energy efficiency, polygeneration systems have gradually become a research hotspot for their low cost and high return features. In this context, a novel Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion system integrated with an air conditioning unit (OTEC-AC) is introduced, demonstrating capabilities in electricity, cooling capacity, and fresh water production by experiments. The effects of various flow rates and temperatures of the heat and cold sources, along with the air-conditioning system water flow rate on the system performance is explored. Besides, the overall performance of the OTEC-AC is compared with four representative OTEC models. The results indicate that there is a threshold for the influence of cold and heat source flow rate on the performance of power generation system. The OTEC-AC system shows a highest net power of 132.6 W, cooling capacity of 2.14 kW, condensate production of 3.24 kg/h, and achieves a system exergy efficiency and CO2 reduction of 34.7 % and 5801 kg/year, respectively. The annual CO2 reduction per kilowatt of installed capacity of the system is increased by 135.6 %, compared with the conventional OTEC system.

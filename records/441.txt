AB With the intensification of global ocean exploration, there is an increasing need for extensive and dispersed wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to meet the requirements of real-time, in-situ, and high-spatial-temporaldensity marine meteorological observations. Nevertheless, providing a reliable power source and ensuring the ongoing maintenance of these WSNs pose significant challenges. Here, an innovative self-powered wireless sensor node is developed to address these challenges, featuring an ultra-high-output triboelectric-electromagnetic hybrid generator (T-EHG) with a swinging mechanism. The T-EHG, which combines triboelectric (TENG) and electromagnetic (EMG) generation, assisted by a universal power management system (UPMS), efficiently converts wave energy into a consistent voltage output between 1.5 V to 3.3 V. Additionally, the self-powered WSNs integrated with T-EHG, UPMS circuits, meteorological sensors, and microcontroller units (MCUs) with LoRa wireless transmission functionality are capable of executing data collection and transmission operations every 10 s under simulated wave conditions. These systems can achieve a maximum wireless transmission range of 1.5 km. Notably, a marine meteorological monitoring system utilizes these autonomous sensor nodes, along with base stations, cloud servers, and terminal devices to effectively implement real-time, on-site measurements of temperature, humidity, and air pressure within the monitored zone. This research underscores the substantial practical utility and extensive application prospects of these advanced self-powered WSNs for marine meteorological surveillance.

AB In this paper, a 1 kW-class Solar -Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion integrated Air-Conditioning (S-OTEC/AC) experimental system, which can provide both electrical energy and cooling energy without any pollution, is constructed for the first time. Based on the experimental data, the system ' s overall performance was comprehensively evaluated in terms of energy, exergy, economy, and environment (4 E). Furthermore, the performance difference between the system using solar energy (i.e., S-OTEC/AC) and the system without solar energy (i.e., OTEC/AC) was compared. The experimental results revealed that the maximum thermal efficiency of the SOTEC/AC system could reach 2.10%, which was 1.91 times higher than the OTEC/AC system. For the OTEC/AC and S-OTEC/AC systems, the maximum cold energy utilization efficiency was 4.12% and 10.09%, and the maximum isentropic efficiency was 18.81% and 76.84%, respectively. The minimum payback period for the SOTEC/AC system was 13.90 years, which was much lower than the 18.40 years of the OTEC/AC system. Additionally, the maximum primary energy saving achieved by the OTEC/AC system was 0.53 kW, while the SOTEC/AC system reached a higher value of 1.56 kW. From the results, the superiority of the S-OTEC/AC system over the OTEC/AC system was confirmed. This work not only provides data references for the actual operating characteristics of the S -OTEC integrated system, but also provides a new technical way for comprehensive utilization of ocean temperature difference energy.

AB In recent years, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have attracted increasing attention in sensing applications. Numerous studies have confirmed that TENG can be used as a sensor to monitor various environmental parameters. However, these works often concentrate solely on a single parameter. Here, we report a highly sensitive multiparameter triboelectric wave sensor (MTWS), comprising a sliding-mode TENG incorporated into flexible magnet layers, a foam ball buoy, and a connecting bar constrained within a linear bearing. A theoretical model, coupled with magnetic prestress, is formulated to predict the electro-mechano behavior of the sensor in response to actual test waves. The experimental results indicate that external magnetic prestress enhances sensor sensitivity, and the predicted wave height aligns well with the commercial sensor results. Based on the proficient energy transmutation advantage of sliding-mode TENG, a remarkable sensitivity of 33.627 mu A/(m/s) and a minimal resolution of 0.00137 m/s are reached in wave velocity monitoring. Importantly, the MTWS shows the ability to monitor wave height, wave speed, and wave period simultaneously. Our research establishes the substantial potential of MTWS as a multifaceted wave-sensing apparatus, rendering it highly adaptable for integration within marine wave surveillance systems.

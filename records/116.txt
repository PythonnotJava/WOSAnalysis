AB Climate model simulations of changes to Earth's energy budget are fundamental to improve understanding of both historical and future climate change. However, coupled models are prone to "drift" (i.e., they contain spurious unforced trends in state variables) due to incomplete spinup or nonclosure of the energy budget. This work assesses the globally integrated energy budgets of 25 models in phase 5 of CMIP (CMIP5). It is shown that for many of the models there is a significant disagreement between ocean heat content changes and net top-of-atmosphere radiation. The disagreement is largely time-constant and independent of forcing scenario. Furthermore, most of the nonconservation seems to occur as a result of energy leaks external to the ocean model realm. After drift correction, the time-varying energy budget is consistent at decadal time scales, and model responses to climate forcing are not sensitive to the magnitude of their drift. This demonstrates that, although drift terms can be significant, model output can be corrected post hoc without biasing results.

FX The authors are indebted to Dr. Jonathon Gregory, Dr. Alex Sen Gupta,
   and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments in the preparation of
   this manuscript, and to Paola Petrelli for help in managing the CMIP5
   data. DM is partly supported financially by the Australian Climate
   Change Science Program. Much of the analysis took place during a
   visiting science fellowship undertaken by MDP that was sponsored by
   CSIRO and the University of Tasmania. MDP was supported by the Joint UK
   DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme (GA01101) and his
   work represents a contribution to the Natural Environment Research
   Council DEEP-C project NE/K005480/1. We acknowledge the World Climate
   Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modelling, which is
   responsible for CMIP, and we thank the climate modeling groups (listed
   in Table 1 of this paper) for producing and making available their model
   output. For CMIP the U.S. Department of Energy's Program for Climate
   Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison provides coordinating support and
   led development of software infrastructure in partnership with the
   Global Organization for Earth System Science Portals. Much of the
   analysis was performed using the NCAR Command Language (NCL).

AB The need for effective ocean monitoring in the marine environment presents a meaningful and challenging research direction to develop multi-directional, self-powered, and environmentally friendly sensors. This study presents a self-powered coral-inspired sensing (SPCS) system for real-time ocean wave monitoring. The SPCS integrates a triboelectric nanogenerator, a small electromagnetic generator (EMG)-based wave energy harvesting, and biomimetic structures to harvest mechanical energy from ocean waves, enabling autonomous operation without an external power source. The system demonstrates high sensitivity to wave height, frequency, and multi-directional sensing. Specifically, the SPCS accurately detects wave heights ranging from 25 mm to 125 mm, exhibiting a linear voltage increase with a correlation coefficient of 0.95. The EMG-based wave energy harvesting generates approximately 3 mW of power under typical wave conditions, sufficient to sustain the system's wireless transmission module. Thus, the SPCS offers a promising solution for long-term, remote wave monitoring in marine environments, offshore platforms, and oceanographic research.

AB A method is presented for calculating a complete, numerically closed, mechanical energy budget in a realistic simulation of circulation in a coastal-estuarine domain. The budget is formulated in terms of the "local'' available potential energy (APE; Holliday and McIntyre 1981). The APE may be split up into two parts based on whether a water parcel has been displaced up or down relative to its rest depth. This decomposition clearly shows the different APE signatures of coastal upwelling (particles displaced up by wind) and the estuary (particles displaced down by mixing). Because the definition of APE is local in almost the same sense that kinetic energy is, this study may form meaningful integrals of reservoir and budget terms even over regions that have open boundaries. However, the choice of volume to use for calculation of the rest state is not unique and may influence the results. Complete volume-integrated energy budgets over shelf and estuary volumes in a realistic model of the northeast Pacific and Salish Sea give a new way to quantify the state of these systems and the physical forces that influence that state. On the continental shelf, upwelling may be quantified using APE, which is found to have order-one seasonal variation with an increase due to winds and decrease due to mixing. In the Salish Sea estuarine system, the APE has much less seasonal variation, and the magnitude of the most important forcing terms would take over 7 months to fully drain this energy.

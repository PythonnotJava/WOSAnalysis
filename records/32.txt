AB The present paper comprises of an integrated system in which industrial heating, space cooling, electrical power and fresh water are produced by multigeneration system using solar, geothermal and ocean thermal energy inputs. Fresh water is produced using a multi stage flash desalination (MSF), and the direct steam generator (DSG) is used to produce power from solar. The geothermal system, with double stage flashing, is incorporated to assist solar due to its intermittent nature. The ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) is interconnected with desalination system while producing 30.49 kW with 0.73% energy efficiency. The proposed system is analyzed energetically and exegetically, and it is found that the energy and exergy efficiencies of the overall system are 13.93% and 17.97% respectively.

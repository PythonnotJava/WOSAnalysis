AB Wave energy and ocean current energy are considered stable, reliable, and highly predictable renewable energy sources. The development of ocean current energy conversion technology is crucial in addressing power shortages. However, the low velocity of most ocean currents worldwide, typically less than 1.5 m/s, poses a challenge for traditional ocean current energy capture devices. Current estimations of power generation from underwater devices often significantly differ from actual results. This study presents an eel-type power generation device designed for underwater use, investigates the design and optimization of a hydraulic power take-off (PTO) system suitable for such devices, and examines key components of the hydraulic PTO system like variable hydraulic motors and generators. Analytical research was conducted to understand its operational characteristics, with a focus on components such as the accumulator, speed control valve, and energy storage flywheel. The article also delves into the hydrodynamic and energy conversion characteristics of the device under shallow water wave and current conditions, enhancing the hydraulic PTO system model and establishing an integrated calculation model for real-time data transmission during the calculation process. Through evaluations of pitch angle and power generation under varying sea conditions, the study explores the impact of hydraulic motor displacement and damping coefficient on the hydrodynamic and power generation characteristics of the device, further validated through sea trials. The study findings indicate a high level of parameter adaptation among the components of the hydraulic system. The addition of an accumulator to the system results in smoother output response curves, suggesting that the accumulator absorbs impacts and stabilizes the hydraulic power transmission system. The proposed comprehensive calculation method enables a more precise prediction of the performance of the eel power generation device in real marine environments, capturing its movement behavior and power generation characteristics. Adjusting the motor displacement or damping coefficient under specific conditions can optimize the total damping of the hydraulic PTO system for maximum power output. The optimal power point of the hydraulic power generation system varies for different sea conditions, with a potential power generation efficiency of up to 80.3% under certain circumstances.

AB Using the conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation (CNOP) approach, sensitive areas of adaptive observation for predicting the seasonal reduction of the upstream Kuroshio transport (UKT) were investigated in the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). The vertically integrated energy scheme was utilized to identify sensitive areas based on two factors: the specific energy scheme and sensitive area size. Totally 27 sensitive areas, characterized by three energy schemes and nine sensitive area sizes, were evaluated. The results show that the total energy (TE) scheme was the most effective because it includes both the kinetic and potential components of CNOP. Generally, larger sensitive areas led to better predictions. The size of 0.5% of the model domain was chosen after balancing the effectiveness and efficiency of adaptive observation. The optimal sensitive area OSen was determined accordingly. Sensitivity experiments on OSen were then conducted, and the following results were obtained: (1) In OSen, initial errors with CNOP or CNOP-like patterns were more likely to yield worse predictions, and the CNOP pattern was the most unstable. (2) Initial errors in OSen rather than in other regions tended to cause larger prediction errors. Therefore, adaptive observation in OSen can be more beneficial for predicting the seasonal reduction of UKT.

AB The exploitation and utilization of seawater resources has become a significant research topic nowadays. In this communication, we report a rechargeable desalination battery system for the first time. This design can integrate the electrochemical battery, seawater desalination, and acid-alkali production in one system. The basic working principle of the designed system was illustrated, and further proved by the results of the experiments. Furthermore, future research directions and outlooks of this system are proposed. This conceptual work provides a promising technology for utilization of natural seawater resources.

AB The integration of renewable energy technologies (solar, wind, biomass, ocean, geothermal energy) is gaining importance in the United Arab Emirates owing to the high energy demand and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper presents the analysis and results of the performance and optimization of a stand-alone solar PV power system with single-axis (horizontal and vertical) and dual-axis solar trackers and a diesel generator (DG) for the city of Khorfakkan, Sharjah. The modeling, simulations, and optimization analysis of the hybrid energy system (HES) were performed with the HOMER software based on the daily energy consumption of 37.75 MWh in the study area. The simulation results show that employing an HES with dual-axis solar trackers is the best power system architecture considering the renewable fraction (48.55%) and levelized cost of energy (LCOE; 0.25 $/kWh). The proposed HES meets the annual energy demand of the city (13,778 MWh) without shortages and with an electricity excess of 9.81%. In addition, the sensitivity analysis shows that the HES with dual-axis solar PV tracking system provides lower electricity costs (250 $/MWh) and the highest GHG emission reduction (69.6%, which is equivalent to the GHG emission reduction of a diesel engine consuming 682,279 gallons of diesel fuel).

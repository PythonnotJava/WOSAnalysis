AB Despite the enormous global potential of ocean wave energy, it has yet to achieve a level of maturity and economic competitiveness that would result in a substantial impact. Challenges include direct integration into weak or isolated microgrids, a high proportion of uncertain marine environments, nonlinear dynamics, oscillating water column (OWC) device limitations, slower response times, unplanned power outages, power fluctuations, high capital and operational costs in ocean wave energy conversion (OWEC) systems. To this end, a new independent multi-stage design approach is proposed for the performance enhancement of an OWC-based OWEC system. Firstly, an airflow and rotational speed optimal control stage enhances power capture in the Wells turbine-based OWC plant. Secondly, compared to conventional control, the proposed permanent magnet synchronous generator control incorporates an adaptive nonlinear back-stepping control algorithm based on Lyapunov stability theory. Thirdly, introducing reconfigurable control into the conventional six-leg power converter ensures the uninterrupted operation of an OWEC system. Lastly, a model-predictive control-based energy management system is integrated with a bidirectional DC-DC converter that delivers steady power from the gridconnected OWC OWEC system. Hence, MATLAB simulations ensure the overall performance enhancement and feasibility of the OWEC system application and verify that the proposed multi-stage solution is efficient, robust, and reliable.

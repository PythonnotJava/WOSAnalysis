AB Extracting energy from waves offers a promising solution for ocean robots to address energy limitations and extend operational time. However, the compact size of ocean robots and the random nature of waves impose significant design challenges for wave energy converters. In response to these problems, this paper proposes an ocean robot that adopts a dual-mode operation principle and integrates an umbrella-shaped wave energy converter (U-WEC). In U-WEC mode, the robot deploys four foldable wings to harvest wave energy, while in robot mode, it folds the wings for a compact structure. The robot in U-WEC mode is designed with central symmetry and a float with low natural frequency, ensuring the adaptability to waves with random directions and low frequency. The operation principle of the robot is detailed along with the structure design. Then, a hydrodynamic model is established to calculate the motion responses of the robot in U-WEC mode. In the wave tank experiment, the dual-mode operation principle is first validated and then the wave energy conversion performance is tested, achieving an average power output of 2.59 W. Based on the proposed model verified with experimental results, the robot demonstrates insensitivity to wave directions and the capability to harness low-frequency waves, confirming its feasibility and potential for practical applications.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) shows great potential in the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) system, in which the path planning algorithm plays a fundamental role. However, the complex underwater environment brings greater challenges to AUV path planning, especially the ocean current, which has a profound impact on time and energy consumption. This article focuses on the complex ocean current condition and proposes an underwater path planning method based on proximal policy optimization (UP4O). In this novel method, a deep reinforcement network is constructed to serve as a decision control to plan the moving direction of AUV. An information encoding module is developed to extract the features of the local obstacles. Furthermore, UP4O integrates the obstacle features with the current state information, including relative position, ocean current, and velocity, enabling the AUV to focus on the global direction and local obstacles at the same time. Additionally, to further adapt to the ocean current and shorten the time cost, UP4O expands the action space of AUV, realizing a fine and flexible action adjustment. The wide applicability of UP4O has been proved by numerous experiments. The proposed algorithm can always plan the time-saving and collision-free paths in complex underwater environments with various terrains and ocean current.

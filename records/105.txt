AB Mesoscale eddies are ubiquitous in the world ocean and are a key factor in maintaining the global oceanic energy balance. Geophysical turbulence theory predicts that the eddy length scale should increase to Rhines scale as it inherits the inverse energy cascade from smaller scales that help to stabilize the ocean circulation system. However, satellite-observed mesoscale eddies are much smaller than predicted, which indicates that unclear forward energy cascades prevail in their life cycles. In this study, we explore the role of finite rough topography in modulating eddy kinetic energy and horizontal length scales by using a series of submesoscale resolving numerical simulations with parameters typical of the Drake Passage. Our results show that, when compared with those generated over a flat bottom, the presence of rough topography can substantially reduce the horizontal length scales of eddies by approximately 60%-70%, even in upper layers 2-3 km above the bottom. Rough topography also consumes significant amounts of eddy kinetic energy, as the volume-mean eddy kinetic energy over a rough bottom decreases by about 70%-80% when compared with that over a flat bottom. By using a dynamics-based decomposition method, we subtracted the submesoscale motions from total flow and found that, in addition to energetic internal lee waves, deep-ocean submesoscale processes (integrated over the bottommost 1 km) contributed roughly 22% of the total viscosity dissipation across the whole research domain over a rough bottom. Therefore, this study indicates that the role of deep-ocean submesoscale motions in the energy cascade and abyssal mixing should be considered in ocean model parameterizations in the future.

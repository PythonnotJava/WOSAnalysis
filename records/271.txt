AB Green hydrogen production is a promising solution for the effective and economical exploitation of floating offshore wind energy in the far and deep sea. The inherent fluctuation and intermittency of wind power significantly challenge the comprehensive performance of the water electrolysis systems and hydrogen postprocessing systems. Effective coordination with energy storage, including both electricity energy storage and hydrogen energy storage, can mitigate these challenges. Subsea energy storage is an emerging and promising alternative to conventional floating onboard energy storage. In this review, various potential subsea electricity and hydrogen energy storage solutions for 'floating offshore wind + hydrogen' are examined and compared. Many advantages, including security, energy efficiency, economy, lifecycle, and management, can be brought about if the energy storage systems are deployed at the seabed. In particular, integrating intermediate energy storage between the wind farm and hydrogen production plant will allow the expensive electrolyzers to be sized for a high utilization factor and reduce the degradation of electrolyzer performance. Recommendations are provided by analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of these energy storage options. Analysis of policy and market indicates that the period from 2024 to 2030 will be critical for the long-term competition of subsea energy storage with floating energy storage. Overall, subsea energy storage can be a promising enabler for emerging floating offshore wind hydrogen production. This review is intended to arouse extensive discussion and investigation on this topic.

AB It is widely known from energy balances that global oceans play a fundamental role in atmospheric seasonal anomalies via coupling mechanisms. However, numerical weather prediction models still have limitations in long-term forecasting due to their nonlinear sensitivity to initial deep oceanic conditions. As the Mediterranean climate has highly unpredictable seasonal variability, we designed a complementary method by supposing that 1) delayed teleconnection patterns provide information about ocean-atmosphere coupling on subseasonal time scales through the lens of 2) partially predictable quasi-periodic oscillations since 3) forecast signals can be extracted by smoothing noise in a continuous leadtime horizon. To validate these hypotheses, the subseasonal predictability of temperature and precipitation was analyzed at 11 reference stations in the Mediterranean area in the 1993-2021 period. The novel method, presented here, consists of combining lag-correlated teleconnections (15 indices) with self-predictability techniques of residual quasi-oscillation based on wavelet (cyclic) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) (linear) analyses. The prediction skill of this teleconnection-wavelet-ARIMA (TeWA) combination was cross-validated and compared to that of the ECMWF's Seasonal Forecast System 5 (SEAS5)-ECMWF model (3 months ahead). Results show that the proposed TeWA approach improves the predictability of first-month temperature and precipitation anomalies by 50%-70% compared with the forecast of SEAS5. On a moving-averaged daily scale, the optimum prediction window is 30 days for temperature and 16 days for precipitation. The predictable ranges are consistent with atmospheric bridges in teleconnection patterns [e.g., Upper-Level Mediterranean Oscillation (ULMO)] and are reflected by spatial correlation with sea surface temperature (SST). Our results suggest that combinations of the TeWA approach and numerical models could boost new research lines in subseasonalto-seasonal forecasting.

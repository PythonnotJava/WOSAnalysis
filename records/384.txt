AB With the rapid development of communication, the future Internet of Things will greatly expand its coverage to form the space-air-ground-ocean-integrated network (SAGOI-Net) and provide globally ubiquitous applications and services. In SAGOI-Net, the existing research work focused on system design and neglected the theoretical analysis of system performance. Furthermore, the Nakagami- $m$ fading model can fit the experimental data better than the Rayleigh and Rice fading models. Also, the Nakagami- $m$ fading model can adapt to the SAGOI-Net environment by changing the value of the shaping parameter $m$ . However, there is no work to analyze the performance of SAGOI-Net using Nakatomi- $m$ fading. Therefore, in this article, the synchronous downlink system is theoretically analyzed using the Nakagami- $m$ fading model. However, Then, the statistical characteristics of multiple access interference (MAI) and MAI-plus noise are theoretically derived. Furthermore, the accurate expression of the bit-error rate (BER) for the fading model is also derived. After that, we establish the relationship between the number of users, BER, and the information transmission rate to optimize energy efficiency. Finally, simulation results verify that the theoretical derivation results are reliable and effective.

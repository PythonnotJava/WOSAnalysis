AB The Western Pacific sees more tropical typhoons and storms annually as compared to other ocean basins. The destructive typhoons caused economic and infrastructure damage and have left many devastated communities. The use of solar photovoltaic power is also increasing, and in the event of extended power cuts, it can provide power to the affected communities, particularly during the response and recovery periods. However, solar installations are also vulnerable to typhoon-force winds and can suffer extensive damages. Currently, limited work has been conducted on approaches that optimise solar panels installation in low-rise residential buildings in terms of structural and energy performance. A solution that can reduce solar installation damage and frequency is necessary, especially for developing countries. A framework based on fluid-structure interaction (FSI) modelling and building energy simulation (BES) was proposed to evaluate roof-mounted solar panels' structural and energy performance. The FSI simulation was carried out for a typical low-rise building design with solar panels subjected to typhoon-strength approach winds. Different configurations were simulated in BES to predict the building energy demand and optimise the solar photovoltaic energy generation. Based on the evaluated configurations and conditions, it was observed that the panels failed on the roof's leeward side, and maximum destruction occurs at 45 degrees wind direction. A balance between structural resilience and energy generation was observed for the building with a roof pitch of 37 degrees, sustaining the occupant's energy requirements even in the face of typhoons and other extreme storms. The framework proposed in this study can support decision-makers and stakeholders in planning and designing typhoon resilient solar PV rooftop installations.

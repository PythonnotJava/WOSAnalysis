AB Ecosystem-based management (EBM) of the ocean considers all impacts on and uses of marine and coastal systems. In recent years, there has been a heightened interest in EBM tools that allow testing of alternative management options and help identify tradeoffs among human uses. End-to-end ecosystem modeling frameworks that consider a wide range of management options are a means to provide integrated solutions to the complex ocean management problems encountered in EBM. Here, we leverage the global advances in ecosystem modeling to explore common opportunities and challenges for ecosystem-based management, including changes in ocean acidification, spatial management, and fishing pressure across eight Atlantis (atlantis.cmar.csiro.au ) end-toend ecosystem models. These models represent marine ecosystems from the tropics to the arctic, varying in size, ecology, and management regimes, using a three-dimensional, spatially-explicit structure parametrized for each system. Results suggest stronger impacts from ocean acidification and marine protected areas than from altering fishing pressure, both in terms of guild-level (i.e., aggregations of similar species or groups) biomass and in terms of indicators of ecological and fishery structure. Effects of ocean acidification were typically negative (reducing biomass), while marine protected areas led to both "winners" and "losers" at the level of particular species (or functional groups). Changing fishing pressure (doubling or halving) had smaller effects on the species guilds or ecosystem indicators than either ocean acidification or marine protected areas. Compensatory effects within guilds led to weaker average effects at the guild level than the species or group level. The impacts and tradeoffs implied by these future scenarios are highly relevant as ocean governance shifts focus from single-sector objectives (e.g., sustainable levels of individual fished stocks) to taking into account competing industrial sectors' objectives (e.g., simultaneous spatial management of energy, shipping, and fishing) while at the same time grappling with compounded impacts of global climate change (e.g., ocean acidification and warming).

FX This publication was an outcome of the first International Atlantis
   Ecosystem Modeling Summit (http://atlantis.cmar.csiro.au/;
   http://www/en/atlantis/Atlantis-Summit.html) which took place in
   Honolulu, Hawaii on December 7-11, 2015 and was convened and funded by
   CSIRO (Australia), NOAA Fisheries (US), and IMR (Norway) and the
   Norwegian Research Council. EO and CE received funding from the
   Norwegian Research Fund project PRIME TRADEOFFS (Cofasp ID 1277). HML
   was funded through the grant "Implementing EcosystemBased Fisheries
   Management: Two Case Studies in the Northern Gulf of California" from
   The David and Lucile Packard Foundation to CEDO Intercultural, and a
   Microsoft Azure Research Award "Exploring ecosystem-level effects of
   fisheries, management, and climate change in marine systems" provided
   cloud computing resources. KJ was funded in part by a grant from
   Washington Sea Grant, University of Washington, pursuant to National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Award No. NA15OAR4170181. GF was
   funded in part by a grant from the Cooperative Institute for the North
   Atlantic Region, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, pursuant to
   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Award No.
   NA14OAR4320158. IK and California Current model development benefited
   greatly from a grant from the NOAA Ocean Acidification Program and
   National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science. MW and the Guam model
   development was funded by the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program. The

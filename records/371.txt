AB Virtual reality technology is a technology that generates a high-fidelity simulation environment by computer and enables users to immerse in the environment through a variety of sensor interfaces, thus realizing direct interaction between users and the virtual environment. Virtual environment is the application representation space of virtual reality technology, which is a visual platform integrating various technologies. For specific applications, building a three-dimensional, high-fidelity, and interactive virtual environment system is an important topic in the application of virtual reality technology. In this paper, simple illumination model and global illumination model are discussed, and the algorithm for parametric surface is discussed. In addition, the application of OpenGL in illumination model and texture mapping is also introduced. Taking the construction of virtual marine environment as an example, this paper develops a virtual marine environment system based on it. This paper introduces the simulation and simulation of ocean waves based on OpenGL wave spectrum by the method of equal energy.

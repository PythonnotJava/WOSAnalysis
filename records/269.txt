AB The penetration level of renewable and sustainable energy resources such as geothermal, wind, solar energies and ocean in power generation systems has been increasing. One of the important renewable energy resources is tidal power plants which makes use of rising and falling sea water level. Because of the uncertain nature of the generated power arisen from the variation in the water level in flood and ebb situations, integration of large-scale reservoir-based tidal power plants to power systems can involve numerous types of challenges. Thus, large-scale tidal power plants can be effectively used in operation studies of power systems. For this purpose, a probabilistic approach is introduced in this paper based on the modified PJM technique for integrating the large-scale tidal plant into operation studies of the power system. In this regard, a multi-state reliability model considering both the failure rate of composed components and the variation in the tide levels is developed and used in the operation studies. For evaluation of the impact of the tidal power plant on operation studies of a power system, numerical examples are put forward in which important indices such as unit commitment risk, required spinning reserve and peak load carrying capability can be calculated.

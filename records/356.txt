AB The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) constellation is designed to provide observations of surface wind speed in and near the inner core of tropical cyclones with high temporal resolution throughout the storm's life cycle. A method is developed for estimating tropical cyclone integrated kinetic energy (IKE) using CYGNSS observations. IKE is calculated for each geographically based quadrant out to an estimate of the 34-kt (1 kt 5 0.51ms(-1)) wind radius. The CYGNSS-IKE estimator is tested and its performance is characterized using simulated CYGNSS observations with realistic measurement errors. CYGNSS-IKE performance improves for stronger, more organized storms and with increasing number of observations over the extent of the 34-kt radius. Known sampling information can be used for quality control. While CYGNSS-IKE is calculated for individual geographic quadrants, using a total-IKE-a sum over all quadrants-improves performance. CYGNSS-IKE should be of interest to operational and research meteorologists, insurance companies, and others interested in the destructive potential of tropical cyclones developing in data-sparse regions, which will now be covered by CYGNSS. The CYGNSS-IKE product will be available for the 2017 Atlantic Ocean hurricane season.

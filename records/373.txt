AB Harvesting wind energy from the environment and integrating it with the internet of things and artificial intelligence to enable intelligent ocean environment monitoring are effective approach. There are some challenges that limit the performance of wind energy harvesters, such as the larger start-up torque and the narrow operational wind speed range. To address these issues, this paper proposes a wind energy harvesting system with a self-regulation strategy based on piezoelectric and electromagnetic effects to achieve state monitoring for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). The proposed energy harvesting system comprises eight rotation units with centrifugal adaptation and four piezoelectric units with a magnetic coupling mechanism, which can further reduce the start-up torque and expand the wind speed range. The dynamic model of the energy harvester with the centrifugal effect is explored, and the corresponding structural parameters are analyzed. The simulation and experimental results show that it can obtain a maximum average power of 23.25 mW at a wind speed of 8 m/s. Furthermore, three different magnet configurations are investigated, and the optimal configuration can effectively decrease the resistance torque by 91.25% compared with the traditional mode. A prototype is manufactured, and the test result shows that it can charge a 2200 mu F supercapacitor to 6.2 V within 120 s, which indicates that it has a great potential to achieve the self-powered low-power sensors. Finally, a deep learning algorithm is applied to detect the stability of the operation, and the average accuracy reached 95.33%, which validates the feasibility of the state monitoring of USVs.

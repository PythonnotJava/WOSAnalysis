AB Blue energy represents a crucial renewable energy resource; however, its development has been limited by the low and variable frequency characteristics of sea waves. In this study, we present a novel approach, wherein a spring pendulum coupled hybrid energy harvester (SPC-HEH) is employed to address these limitations. The SPCHEH integrates two electromagnetic generators (EMGs), two piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs), and two multilayer-structured triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) into a vessel, enabling efficient wave energy harvesting. Notably, the integration of the lightweight PENG and TENG with the heavy EMG not only enhances the water wave energy harvesting capability of SPC-HEH but also optimizes its spatial utilization efficiency. Additionally, owing to the spring pendulum, the SPC-HEH is capable of simultaneously harnessing the wave kinetic energy of horizontal and vertical directions and realize the decoupling of vertical energy capture from horizontal energy capture. Remarkably, owing to its precise geometric design and efficient space utilization, the SPC-HEH achieves an impressive peak power density of 82.4 Wm(-3). Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of the SPC-HEH by integrating it with a circuit as a self-powered ocean buoy for real-time monitoring of ocean temperature, wave frequency, ocean turbidity and other information. The remarkable potential of this system for integration into self-powered smart ocean IoT networks holds significant promise for advancing marine research and environmental monitoring capabilities.

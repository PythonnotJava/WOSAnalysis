AB This research introduces an integrated ocean thermal energy conversion water and power cogeneration system (OTEC-WPCS), combining a Zeotropic Rankine Cycle (ZRC) with Direct Contact Membrane Distillation (DCMD) for efficient power and water production. The hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs), chosen for their zero ozone depletion potential (ODP) and extremely low global warming potential (GWP), are used as working fluid components in the ZRC. Additionally, DCMD is implemented for freshwater generation. A mathematical model is established, incorporating both thermodynamic and CFD simulations. The goal is to identify optimal operating conditions that maximize the output of the system. By coupling DCMD and ZRC in series, the system's efficiency reaches 8.92 %, an improvement of 5.71 % compared to a standalone ZRC system. This configuration allows for more efficient use of surface seawater heat compared to an ammonia-based Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC)-DCMD system. The enhancements include an increase in power and water production per unit mass flow of surface seawater by 0.55 kW/(kg & sdot;s) and 30 %, respectively. Over 60 % of the system's exergy destruction occurs in the DCMD modules and evaporator, while nearly 80 % of the capital cost is associated with the evaporator, condenser, and DCMD heat exchanger. Enhancing the DCMD module structure and heat exchanger can improve both energy and exergy efficiency, and economic feasibility.

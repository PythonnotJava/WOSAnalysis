AB Various forms of high-entropy energy (HEE), such as wind energy, ocean tidal energy, mechanical vibrations, and human motion, are widely distributed in nature and our surroundings. Effectively harvesting and utilizing these forms of energy has become a promising solution to address the challenges of sustainable energy development. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), with their unique advantages in harvesting low-frequency and micro-amplitude mechanical energy, have emerged as a key technology in the field of distributed energy systems and have attracted significant academic attention in recent years. However, to expand the application scenarios of TENGs, it is essential to continuously explore methods for improving their output performance. To meet the high-voltage output requirements of electrochemical applications, we developed a specialized electrochemical triboelectric nanogenerator (EC-TENG) by integrating a planetary gear-based mechanical structure with a multilayer parallel TENG configuration. This design significantly reduces the threshold for mechanical energy input while achieving a high-voltage output. By optimizing the rectification circuit, the crest factor was effectively reduced, and the current output was substantially enhanced. The EC-TENG demonstrated a maximum open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 575 V and a short-circuit current (ISC) of 42 mu A, sufficient to power commercial electronic devices such as lamps. To enhance the portability and durability of the EC-TENG, a standardized manufacturing and packaging process was implemented, enabling quick replacement of vulnerable components and improving system reliability and service life. The EC-TENG shows great potential for high-voltage electrochemical applications, such as rust removal, and offers a sustainable and efficient solution for energy harvesting in distributed systems. This work provides a new perspective for addressing energy challenges and expanding the application scope of TENG-based technologies.

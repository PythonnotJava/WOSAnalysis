AB Decentralized multi-generation systems using renewable energy sources have great potential for combating climate change and promoting sustainable development. This study models and analyzes an integrated solarassisted system consisting of an organic Rankine cycle, a wind turbine, and a thermoelectric unit using EES software. Performance is evaluated through exergy, emergoeconomic, and emergoenvironmental analyses. The economic emergy coefficients are steam turbine (59.93%), evaporator (1.66%), working fluid pump 1 (37.25%), warm sea water pump2 (86.86%), cold sea water pump3 (86.97%), solar collector (100%), wind turbine (100%), and thermoelectric unit (100%). Environmental emergy coefficients are steam turbine (58.56%), evaporator (87.15%), working fluid pump 1 (48.97%), warm sea water pump2 (8.39%), cold sea water pump3 (7.68%), solar collector (100%), wind turbine (77.57%), and thermoelectric unit (100%). The system also reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 1.34 tons, highlighting the technical, economic, and environmental benefits of renewable energy integration.

AB The wave energy harvesting efficiency (EHE) and electrical energy storage efficiency (ESE) significantly impact ocean power at the front-end and back-end stages, respectively. In this work, to maximize the overall energy conversion affected by these two factors, a clip-like structured pendulum coupled nanogenerator (CP-CNG) integrated with a dual-track circuit (DTC) is elaborately designed to address poor energy conversion of the TENGs for marine monitoring. The optimized EHE was realized through coupling one freestanding triboelectric nano -generator (FR-TENG) unit and two electromagnetic generator (EMG) units into two contact-separation tribo-electric nanogenerator (CS-TENG) units. The space utilization rate of CP-CNG can be as high as 91.9%. Meanwhile, increased ESE is achieved by integrating DTC as voltage regulators, which perform backend energy management for CS-TENG and EMG, respectively. It is worth noting that for a 1 mF capacitor, the stored energy via the cooperation of CP-CNG and DTC can reach 60.7 mJ in 110 s, which is about 164 times that of CS-TENG (0.37 mJ) coupling with FR-TENG and EMG and 1.6 times that of CS-TENG (36.8 mJ) with buck circuit, demonstrating excellent synergistic effects. Owing to the synergistic effect, one CP-CNG can continuously drive four thermohygrometers under simulated water wave conditions. In additional, a hazard alarm system, including an immersion sensor, Bluetooth and gateway support, can also be powered by one CP-CNG successfully. This work develops a state-of-the-art concept for maximum energy conversion of TENGs, which should have a pro-found impact on the design of high-performance TENGs in the future.

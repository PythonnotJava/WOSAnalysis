AB The ocean harbors an abundance of resources, encompassing not only wave energy but also considerable wind energy. Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), as a technology for harvesting low-frequency, high-entropy mechanical energy, has shown distinct advantages in the collection and application of marine and wind energy. This study introduces a triboelectric Wind and wave energy harvester (TWWEH), an energy collector based on TENG, which can be used to harness wind and wave energy. The TWWEHs comprise a wind-driven TENG (W-TENG) for wind energy collection and a ring-shaped TENG (R-TENG) for wave energy collection. The proposed vertically integrated TENG architecture enhances spatial utilization rate. Under oscillatory conditions of 0.8 Hz and +/- 30 degrees, the R-TENG generates a peak power of 0.20 mW. While at a wind speed of 10 m s(-1), a peak power of the W-TENG can reach 0.11 mW. This research provides a promising solution to harvest wave and wind energy from the ocean, offering significant potential applications in establishing self-powered oceanic assessment and meteorological systems.

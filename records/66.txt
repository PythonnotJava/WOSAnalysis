AB The primary goal of this study is to develop and test a small-scale horizontal-axis underwater Ocean Current Turbine (OCT) by creating a mathematical model for coupled dynamics aided by a Blade Element Momentum (BEM) simulation-integrated experimental approach. This research is motivated by the urgent need for sustainable energy sources and the vast potential of ocean currents. By integrating mathematical modeling with the experimental testing of scaled model OCTs, this study aims to evaluate performance accurately. The experimental setup involves encapsulating a 3D-printed turbine model within a watertight nacelle which is equipped with sensors for comprehensive data recording during towing tank tests. Through these experiments, we seek to establish correlations between the generated power, force, and rotational speed of the turbine's Permanent Magnet DC (PMDC) motor, which determines the turbine's capability to extract dynamic energy inflow. Moreover, this research aims to provide valuable insights into the accuracy and applicability of theoretical predictions in real-world scenarios by comparing the experimental results with BEM simulations. This combined approach not only advances our understanding of hydrokinetic energy conversion, but also contributes to the development of reliable and efficient renewable energy technologies that address global energy challenges while mitigating environmental impacts.

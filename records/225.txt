AB One of the most important challenges in global climate change research is balancing the carbon budget within the global carbon cycle. Carbon burial in sediments at the land-ocean interface has been difficult to quantify and model because it represents non-steady-state boundary conditions that are also affected by human activities. In this study, we document carbon burial rates in the Yangtze River (1.6-4.9 x 10(12) gC year(-1)) and Hudson River (1.8-3.6 x 10(10) gC year(-1)) estuaries and integrate our results with carbon burial rates determined by others in the world's 25 largest river-estuarine systems (6-11 x 10(13) gC year(-1)). Our results indicate that carbon burial in estuaries, bays, coves, lagoons, mud flats, marshes, mangroves, and other highly productive or protected low-energy areas at the land-ocean interface along the entirety of the world's coastlines may serve as an unrecognized sink within the global carbon budget.

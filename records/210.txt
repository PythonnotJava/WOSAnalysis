AB Marine current turbines (MCTs) are a burgeoning renewable energy technology that may effectively capture the kinetic energy of ocean currents to produce power. Nevertheless, the sporadic and uncertain characteristics of marine currents present substantial obstacles to the reliable functioning of grid-connected MCT systems. By incorporating Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) into grid-connected marine current turbines and implementing intelligent event-triggered Sliding Mode Control (ETSMC), we can significantly improve the transient voltage stability of marine renewable energy systems. The sophisticated event trigger mechanism continuously checks the circumstances of the grid and the operation of the turbine in real-time. The real-time nonlinear control technique enhances the performance of SMES by effectively regulating the flow of active and reactive power, hence ensuring grid stability during transient occurrences. This integrated system aims to improve the dependability and effectiveness of marine current turbine operations, thereby supporting the progress of sustainable marine renewable energy technologies. The resilience of the system was evaluated by its implementation in real-time on a dSPACE-DS1104 board, which was connected to an experimental laboratory bench. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis was conducted by comparing actual and simulated data in order to assess both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the system.

AB Wave energy is a practical option for the sustainable powering of the drifting buoy beyond solar energy. However, efficient harvesting of wave energy from a complex and dynamic ocean environment for a drifting buoy is significantly challenging, since the buoy's global location and orientation are always in spatiotemporal variation. Herein, we propose a novel multi-DOF wave energy harvesting mechanism that integrates three sets of frequency -tunable harvesting systems into an enclosed drifting buoy, which can greatly enhance the energy harvesting ability of a long-term working drifting buoy that encounters direction -varying and frequency -varying waves. A time -averaged electric power up to 9.18 mW was achieved by a prototype that has a diameter of 45 cm, which is 32.76 % higher than the single-DOF case in sea trials. Additionally, laboratory dry test results show that the prototype provided a power up to 288.76 mW in one direction. This work provides an effective strategy for sustainably generating electricity in the offshore environment for drifting buoys.

AB Low-frequency radiated noise, characterized by a distinctive "acoustic fingerprint" is generated when vibrations from marine machinery propagate through a ship's hull into the ocean. This type of noise travels long distances with concentrated and stable energy, posing a significant threat to a ship's acoustic stealth capabilities. Active-passive hybrid isolation is the primary method for reducing low-frequency radiated noise from ships; however, technical challenges remain, such as effectively integrating active and passive components, achieving high output force in a compact design, and addressing the poor linearity of actuator output at low frequencies. To address these issues, this paper presented an innovative electromagnetic-hydraulic-rubber integrated vibration isolator. Firstly, the study analyzed the dynamic characteristics of a two-degree-of-freedom isolation system and investigated the influence of active-passive hybrid vibration isolator parameters on control force and vibration reduction performance. Secondly, it was established that the magnetic circuit model and magnetic field strength expressions for the electromagnetic actuator using magnetic circuit analysis derive the analytical relationship between electromagnetic force, current amplitude, and frequency using the energy method. Subsequently, a mathematical model was developed for the rubber-hydraulic suspension component to examine its dynamic characteristics, hydraulic damping, and hydraulic force amplification transmission laws. Lastly, we organically combine the electromagnetic actuator with the rubber-hydraulic suspension and conduct a multi-physics joint simulation of the integrated vibration isolator using Comsol software to verify the effectiveness of the optimized design and vibration isolation control. Experimental research was carried out on the dynamic characteristics, output force properties, and fatigue characteristics of the integrated vibration isolator prototype. Results indicated that the established models and methods can achieve over 90% accuracy in predicting the performance of the electromagnetic actuator's output force and exhibit good linearity within the 5-400 Hz range. The rubber-hydraulic suspension can achieve an amplification factor of up to 1.5 for the electromagnetic force while reducing the transmission of vibrations to the base. The research findings can enhance the low-frequency vibration isolation performance of marine machinery equipment and improve their acoustic stealth capabilities.

AB Snowmelt is a critical component in the cryosphere and has a direct impact on Earth's energy and water budget. Here, a 40-yr integrated melt onset (MO) dataset over sea ice, ice sheets, and terrestrial snow is compiled from spaceborne microwave radiometers and ERA5, allowing an overall assessment of the cryosphere. Results suggest that MO in both hemispheres shows latitudinal and vertical zonalities. The global cryosphere presented a trend toward earlier MO (-2 days decade(-1)) with hotpots distributed at the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes where the warming rate is much higher than that at lower latitudes. Overall, variations in MO showed a similar pattern to that in near-surface temperature. The advance of MO has been slowing down since the 1990s and no significant trend was observed during the so-called warming hiatus period (1998-2012). Regionally, climatic linkage analyses suggest the local MO variations were associated with different climate indices. MO in the pan-Arctic region is related with the Arctic Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation, while that in the pan-Antarctic region is associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the southern annular mode. Occasionally, abnormal MO occurs as a result of extreme weather conditions. In February 2018, abnormal early melt events that occurred in the Arctic Ocean are found to be linked with the warm southerly flow due to sudden stratospheric warming. These findings suggest the satellite-based MO allows examining the dynamics and extremes in the climate system, both regionally and globally.

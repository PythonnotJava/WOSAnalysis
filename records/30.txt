AB Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) is a heat engine application that utilizes the Rankine cycle to extract energy from the thermal gradient between surface seawater and deep seawater. Hybrid cycle OTEC (H-OTEC) is a combination of an open cycle desalination system and a closed-cycle power generation system that leverages the features of both cycles. Unlike other desalination technologies that require extensive energy to operate, H-OTEC relies entirely on renewable energy. In addition, a desalination plant can be coupled with the H-OTEC system (H-OTEC + D) to improve its performance. Conventionally, the total heat transfer area of heat exchangers per net power is used as an objective function to achieve optimal performance with the lowest capital expenditure cost. The proposed objective function, unlike the conventional one, considers both power and water. In this study, the optimization of H-OTEC + D and H-OTEC is carried out by minimizing the proposed objective function, considering several independent variables. The performance of both systems is evaluated in terms of the objective function, power consumption, seawater flow rates, and desalination ratio. The findings also indicate the effectiveness of the proposed objective function over the conventional one as an effective tool for maximizing power and desalinated water generation.

AB To overcome the limited efficiency of ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), particularly in the mid-latitudes, combined OTEC (C-OTEC) could use power extracted from the latent heat of a power plant condenser. Past research in South Korea has demonstrated the feasibility of a 10 kW C-OTEC system using R134a as a working fluid. As the next phase, a 200 kW C-OTEC demonstration facility with a thermal efficiency of greater than 3% is proposed. This paper presents the engineering design process for kW-scale C-OTEC within a 100 MW-scale thermal power plant. The design process is divided into two stages. First, to predict patterns in steam flow to a connected external evaporator with a porous medium, computational fluid dynamics are calculated. The results show a conservative margin suitable for the conceptual design. Second, an iterative heat balance simulation method simultaneously evaluates the heat balance analysis of the C-OTEC design and the thermal impact of the existing power plant. The design stages are then integrated in terms of heat transference capacity.

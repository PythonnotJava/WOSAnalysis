AB For effective integrity management of marine renewable energy systems in the dynamic and uncertain ocean environments, understanding the failure dynamics is crucial. The cost of investment in marine/offshore renewable energy infrastructures and the associated cost due to failure and loss of energy production necessitate a predictive monitoring methodology that is dynamic and adaptive. This paper presents an integrated multi-state pure-birth-pure-death Markovian-net profit value model for the offshore turbine subsystem failure analysis and its cost-based consequences. The integrated model captures the offshore turbine subsystem's dynamic failure states and its economic implications due to the cost of energy loss and downtime for the period under consideration. The model applies a phase-type exponential distribution to describe the monotonic state of failure. The methodology is demonstrated with an offshore wind turbine gearbox, and it captures the dynamic state of the system and its failure mechanisms. The cumulative effect of the subelements deterioration decreases the gearbox performance by over 35% within the first 2 years of operation.

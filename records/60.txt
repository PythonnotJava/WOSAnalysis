AB The monitoring of currents in the abyssal ocean is an essential foundation of deep-sea research. The state-of-the-art current meter has limitations such as the requirement of a power supply for signal transduction, low pressure resistance, and a narrow measurement range. Here, we report a fully integrated, self-powered, highly sensitive deep-sea current measurement system in which the ultra-sensitive triboelectric nanogenerator harvests ocean current energy for the self-powered sensing of tiny current motions down to 0.02m/s. Through an unconventional magnetic coupling structure, the system withstands immense hydrostatic pressure exceeding 45MPa. A variable-spacing structure broadens the measuring range to 0.02-6.69m/s, which is 67% wider than that of commercial alternatives. The system successfully operates at a depth of 4531m in the South China Sea, demonstrating the record-deep operations of triboelectric nanogenerator-based sensors in deep-sea environments. Our results show promise for sustainable ocean current monitoring with higher spatiotemporal resolution.

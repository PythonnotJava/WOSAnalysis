AB Hydrogen is a main factor in cold cracking or hydrogen-induced cracking. The most crack susceptible region of a steel welded joint is the heat affected zone (HAZ). The formulation and functional-analytical solution of the one-dimensional problem of hydrogen diffusion in an inhomogeneous butt-welded joint considering weld and joint dimensions and initial hydrogen distribution as well as hydrogen diffusion coefficients and solubilities are presented. It is shown that the peak hydrogen concentration in the HAZ of inhomogeneous joints varies in direct proportion to the initial hydrogen concentration in the weld metal. It is inversely proportional to the ratio of hydrogen solubilities in the weld metal and the HAZ metal and is nonlinear in the diffusion coefficient ratio of these metals. The peak hydrogen concentration in the HAZ can exceed 170% of the average initial concentration in the joint if martensitic steel is welded using low-carbon low-alloy welding consumables. The utilization of austenitic consumables leads to a dramatic reduction in the hydrogen concentration in the HAZ in comparison with the non-austenitic consumables. No direct relationship was found between the hydrogen concentration in the HAZ and the hydrogen evolution from the joint surface.

AB In this study, linear friction welding is applied to join JIS-S45C medium carbon steel with ferrite and pearlite structures at temperatures above and below the A1 point. Additionally, low-strain-rate tensile tests are conducted both in air and with a cathodic hydrogen charge to evaluate the hydrogen-embrittlement susceptibility of the linear friction-welded joints under both joining conditions. Results of hydrogen ther-mal-desorption analysis show that the hydrogen-charging conditions in this study simulated atmospheric corrosion conditions. The joining zone of the above-A1 joint comprises fine martensite and ferrite, whereas that for the below-A1 joint comprises ultrafine ferrite and cementite. In air tensile tests, both joints frac-tured in the base-metal region, thus suggesting the high reliability of the joints. In the hydrogen-charged tensile test, the above-A1 joints exhibit premature fracture at the joining zone. By contrast, the below-A1joints exhibit base-metal fractures, thus suggesting that the joints are highly reliable in a hydrogen environ-ment. Fracture-surface observations show that the above-A1 joints exhibit cleavage fractures in the martensite-dominated region. Tensile tests on heat-treated martensite S45C specimens show that their fracture strength decreased significantly in a hydrogen environment. Therefore, the joint fracture is due to the significant decrease in the fracture strength of martensite formed in the above-A1 joints in the hydro-gen environment. The linear friction-welded medium carbon steel joints below the A1 temperature can ensure reliability even in a hydrogen environment

AB The electrochemical behavior of the weld metal, heat-affected zone (HAZ), and base material of super duplex stainless steel (SDSS) welded joints, made with the application of flux-cored arc welding (FCAW) and submerged arc welding (SAW), were investigated with the use of metallographic examinations (optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy), potentiodynamic polarization measurements and total hydrogen content determination in the initial state and after hydrogen charging. The obtained results revealed that the effect of hydrogen depended on the microstructure and type of the region of a welded joint. The highest amount of hydrogen penetrated the welded joint charged at 1mAcm(-2). It was observed in case of the FCAW-welded joint, made with lower heat input. The electrochemical measurements showed that the base material was the most corrosion resistant part of the welded joint while the hydrogen charging strongly changed pitting and general corrosion susceptibility of HAZ and weld metal of both welded joints.

AB The abundance and uneven distribution of renewable energy might cause congestion and curtailment in electric power systems. Transmission expansions can potentially alleviate transmission congestion and reduce renewable energy curtailment. On the other hand, with the substantial cost reduction of electrolyzer technology and the continuing rise of hydrogen demand, converting surplus renewable energy to hydrogen provides synergistic benefits to power and hydrogen systems, but consequently requires joint planning of the two systems. To this end, we propose a joint planning approach for power transmission and hydrogen transportation networks to coordinately optimize the investment and operation of power and hydrogen infrastructure. In our proposed model, detailed truck routing, pipeline, and hydrogen storage are formulated to quantify the flexibility of hydrogen transportation system. A robust joint planning approach is also proposed to address various uncertainties from renewable energy, electric load, and hydrogen demand. Our numerical simulations show that the proposed joint planning model can save the total system cost, reduce renewable energy curtailment, and increase the utilization level of transmission lines.

AB The study investigates the microstructural evolution and susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement in laserwelded joints of oxidation-resistant press-hardened steel. During the press hardening process, the base material underwent a transformation from a recrystallized structure to martensite, accompanied by significant reductions in average grain size and dislocation density across various regions of the welded joint. These changes resulted in notable differences in hydrogen-trapping sites between the welded joint and the base material. Irreversible hydrogen traps were observed exclusively in the base material, while the laser-welded joint demonstrated a high susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement, leading to hydrogen-induced delayed fracture. Intergranular and quasi-cleavage fractures were identified as the dominant failure modes in the welded joint. The underlying mechanism of hydrogen embrittlement in the welded joint was attributed to a synergistic interaction between hydrogen-enhanced decohesion and hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity.

AB The hydrogen embrittlement behavior of two low-carbon medium manganese steel welding joints was elucidated using a slow strain rate tensile experiment, hydrogen permeation experiment, and hydrogen concentration test. The fracture starting position becomes heat-affected zone (HAZ) after hydrogen charging. The hydrogen concentration of HAZ is higher than weld material (WM) for two welding joints after hydrogen charging for both 1 h and 2 h. The hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility of the welding joint with high hydrogen concentration, which contains about 0.03 Ti in both WM and HAZ, is larger than the welding joint that does not contain Ti. When the hydrogen charging time of the Ti-contained welding joints increases from 1 h to 2 h, the fractography of WM changes from small shallow dimples (hydrogen enhanced localized plasticity) to quasi-cleavage and cleavage (hydrogen enhanced decohesion), and the fractography of HAZ changes from quasi-cleavage (hydrogen enhanced decohesion) to intergranular (hydrogen enhanced decohesion).

AB Hydrogen diffusion coefficients of different regions in the welded joint of X80 pipeline steel were measured using the electro-chemical permeation technique. Using ABAQUS software, hydrogen diffusion in X80 pipeline steel welded joint was studied in consideration of the inhomogeneity of the welding zone, and temperature-dependent thermo-physical and mechanical properties of the metals. A three dimensional finite element model was developed and a coupled thermo-mechanical-diffusion analysis was performed. Hydrogen concentration distribution across the welded joint was obtained. It is found that the postweld residual hydrogen exhibits a non-uniform distribution across the welded joint. A maximum equivalent stress occurs in the immediate vicinity of the weld metal. The heat affected zone has the highest hydrogen concentration level, followed by the weld zone and the base metal. Simulation results are well consistent with theoretical analysis.

AB Hydrogen-induced cracking (HIC) behavior and mechanism of E690 welded joint in simulated seawater were studied via microstructure observations, electrochemical hydrogen charging, slow strain rate tension (SSRT) tests and hydrogen content measurement. The results show that the welded joint of E690 steel has a higher HIC susceptibility than that of base metal, in which the inter-critical heat affected zone (ICHAZ) is composed of polygonal ferrite and granular bainite is the final fracture location in the joint. ICHAZ with the lowest yield strength deformed preferentially under the tensile stress, and subsequently, the proliferating dislocations with the deformation strengthening and the continuously charged hydrogen led to the HIC and brittle fracture at the ICHAZ of the welded joint. Moreover, the HIC susceptibility was linearly dependent on the logarithm of total hydrogen concentration in the steel, and the hydrogen concentration had a more obvious effect on the welded joint than the base metal. The higher density of piled dislocations adjoining the M/A islands in the welded joint exhibited a significant effect on the hydrogen agglomeration and diffusion, which enhanced the HIC susceptibility.

AB In order to evaluate the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement(HE) of the L360MH hydrogen transportation pipeline, through electrochemical hydrogen charging (H-charging), mechanical property tests, microstructures and fracture analysis, the longitudinal and girth weld of the straight seam welding pipeline was assessed carefully. The conclusions indicate that both submerged arc welding (SAW) welded joint and tungsten inert-gas welding (TIG) welded joint exhibit high-strength matching characteristics, the strength of the SAW welded joint is about 10 % higher than that of the base metal (BM), while the strength of the (TIG) welded joint has increased by about 17 %, softening was observed in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of the SAW welded joint, with about 9 % reduction in tensile strength compared to the BM. Upon H-charging, the HAZ of welded joints demonstrate a heightened susceptibility to HE. In contrast, the susceptibility to HE of the BM is nearly identical to that of the weld metal (WM), while the HAZ of the TIG welded joint is more susceptible to HE than the SAW welded joint. It has been found that there is a positive correlation between the quantity of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs), Kernel Average Misorientation (KAM), and the susceptibility to HE within the microstructure of welded joints. The fracture surface of the WM and HAZ of welded joints after H-charging exhibits a "fish-eye" river pattern with inclusions in the center area, as well as tear ridges and cleavage steps among other patterns.

AB The effects of fatigue damage on the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) sensitivity of X80 steel welded joints, obtained using flux-cored arc welding method, were investigated in the study. Results show that both the yield and tensile strength increased for all the hydrogencharged welded joints and decreased with the accumulation of fatigue damage. The fracture surface is the mixture of local quasi-cleavage (QC) surrounded by shallow dimples ductile fracture for hydrogen-charged welded joints, whilst that of hydrogen-free welded joint is typical dimple ductile fracture. The presence of fisheye morphology might be related to the hydrogen, local strain accumulation in the vicinity of inclusions and dislocations evolution caused by the cyclic load. The mechanism is the synergistic action of hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) and hydrogen enhanced localized plasticity (HELP). However, the pinning effect of hydrogen on the dislocation motion is the dominant role. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) is a critical issue affecting the structural integrity of materials, including welded joints, used in hydrogen storage and transportation. In this study, the influence of HE on the fatigue behavior of 316L austenitic stainless-steel welded joints was investigated. Tensile and fatigue tests were performed on base material, welded joints, and hydrogen-charged welded joints to assess the degradation in their mechanical properties. The results revealed that welding significantly reduced the fatigue strength of the material, and the presence of hydrogen further intensified this effect. Microstructural analysis confirmed the formation of austenitic-ferritic duplex microstructures in the weld bead, with delta ferrite improving resistance to hot cracking but increasing susceptibility to HE. Fractographic examination of weld beads exposed to hydrogen charging showed characteristic hydrogen-induced cracking.

AB The distribution of diffusion hydrogen in the welded joints of high-strength X80 pipeline steel was investigated using finite element method. Using ABAQUS software, hydrogen diffusion in X80 pipeline steel welded joint was studied in consideration of the inhomogeneity of the weld zone, and temperature-dependent thermo-physical and mechanical properties of the metals. The effects of preheating procedure and welding heat input on the hydrogen diffusion behavior were studied. Three-dimensional finite element models were developed and coupled thermo-mechanical-diffusion analyses under different welding conditions were performed. It is found that the postweld residual hydrogen exhibits a non-uniform distribution across the welded joint. A maximum equivalent stress occurs in the immediate vicinity of the weld metal. The heat affected zone has the highest hydrogen concentration level, followed by the welding zone and the base metal. Both preheating and increasing heat input are effective in reducing the diffusion hydrogen content remaining in the weld zone for the X80 pipeline steel welded joints. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

AB The effect of hydrogen on the pitting susceptibility of 2205 duplex stainless steel welded joints was investigated using metallographic characterisation, electrochemical techniques and immersion experiments. The results show that the diffusible hydrogen content in the welded joints is approximately twice that of base material (BM). Hydrogen significantly decreases the pitting potential (Epit) of the welded joints, while increasing the carrier density in the passive film, suggesting that hydrogen weakens the protective properties of the passive film and increases the pitting susceptibility of the welded joints. According to immersion experiments, the pitting susceptibility of the welded joint from high to low is heat-affected zone (HAZ), BM and weld metal (WM), the HAZ tends to be more prone to the formation of larger and more stable pits, and the number of inclusions at the HAZ is significantly greater than that at the BM and WM. For BM under hydrogen charging, austenite phase is usually corroded first, because hydrogen tends to be enriched in the austenitic phase of BM. However, in some regions of WM, ferrite phase corroded first, which is related to the enrichment of hydrogen in the ferrite in the weld area.

AB The interaction between fatigue damage and hydrogen in TC4 welded joints was analyzed considering specimens with different pre-cycles. The fracture failure caused by hydrogen-induced fatigue damage was investigated using tensile testing and microstructural observations. The results indicate that increasing the number of pre-cycles increases the specimens' initial dislocation density, enhancing the severity of the hydrogen-induced embrittlement phenomenon. The hydrogen-enhanced local plasticity mechanism, manifested by fracture along the grain boundary, dominates the tensile process in fatigue-damaged hydrogen-filled welded joints after 10,000 and 20,000 pre-cycles. After 30,000 pre-cycles, the hydrogen-enhanced decohesion mechanism dominates the tensile process, manifesting as a transgranular cleavage decoupling fracture.

AB Both adjustable hydropower and hydrogen power present viable solutions to address the intermittency and fluctuations of renewables such as wind and photovoltaic power. To complement non-schedulable renewables, previous studies have individually explored the operating strategies of hydropower or hydrogen power. However, the joint operating rules of hydropower and hydrogen power have seldom been investigated, primarily due to the complex reciprocal relationship between multiple adjustable power sources. This study aims to develop the joint operating rules for hydro-hydrogen-wind-photovoltaic hybrid energy systems (HESs). First, a deterministic optimal operation model is built to optimize both the operation benefit and assurance rate. Subsequently, the operation decisions are synthesized to identify reference values of operation rules' parameters, with crosscorrelation analysis aiding in the identification of the proper decision variables. Finally, operating rules' parameters are optimized through the direct policy search method. Results from a case study using China's Ertan hydro-hydrogen-wind-photovoltaic HES indicate that the reservoir release emerges as the most influential decision variable for formulating joint operating rules. Notably, the joint operating rules outperform conventional methods, yielding a 16.93% improvement in annual operational benefits and a 7.31% increase in assurance rates. These findings underscore the substantial enhancements in energy use efficiency facilitated by the proposed joint operating rules.

   zone; Hydrogen; Cold cracking
AB Over the last decades, press hardening or hot forming has become all pervasive for automotive body-in-white design. Press-hardened boron-microalloyed steels are widely used in modern body structure for high safety standard and lightweight achievement. Considering the welding of press-hardened components, some special considerations have to be taken into account compared to conventional deep-drawing steel grades. The welding process results in a significant hardness drop in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) which may lead to a change in failure mode or premature failure. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of the welded joints are influenced by the weld metal hydrogen content. Hydrogen pickup of press-hardened steel may result from the heat treatment or the welding process. Due to the martensitic microstructure and the high strength level, a critical hydrogen content may cause hydrogen embrittlement or hydrogen-assisted cold cracking (HACC). This paper contributes to the determination of the diffusible hydrogen content in resistance spot-welded and gas metal arc-welded joints of press-hardened boron-microalloyed steel. It also promotes the understanding of the effect of diffusible hydrogen on the mechanical properties of those joints. Hydrogen was deliberately introduced during welding by wetting of the sheet surface with hydrogenated fluids. The hydrogen content in the weld metal was quantified by thermal desorption mass spectrometry (TDMS) technique. Finally, the influence on the mechanical properties of the welded joints was determined based on a simple component test. A GMA-welded component was set under a constant static load and evaluated for delayed hydrogen-assisted cracking.

TI Effect of ultrasonic surface rolling process on hydrogen embrittlement
   behavior of TC4 laser welded joints
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE

ID TITANIUM; STRESS
AB Some key structural parts made of welding titanium alloys usually serve in hydrogen environment in aerospace, ship building and chemical industries. To investigate the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behaviors of the welded titanium alloy joints and the impact factors, the TC4 titanium alloy joints welded by laser welding method were first treated by ultrasonic surface rolling process (USRP). Then, slow-rate tensile tests were conducted under electrochemical hydrogen charging condition to compare the mechanical properties of the TC4 laser welded joints before and after USRP. On this basis, the HE behaviors and mechanisms of the USRP-treated TC4 laser welded joint and the USRP-untreated one were discussed in detail. The results show that USRP could significantly improve the anti-hydrogen embrittlement behaviors of the TC4 laser welded joint, which could be attributed to the grain refinement and residual compressive stress in the deformation layer induced by USRP. The results of this paper provide a theoretical basis for the design of anti-hydrogen embrittlement metal materials.

AB The safe service of reeled-pipeline welded joint subjected to multiple cyclic plastic deformation (CPD) is challenged by hydrogen embrittlement (HE) in the process of gas and petroleum transportation. Therefore, this work aims to study the interrelation of hydrogen and the ductility of X65 reeled-pipeline welded joint with CPD by using electrochemical hydrogen charging. The results showed that hydrogen could lead to the ductility degradation, regardless of whether the CPD process was performed. But the hydrogen-induced ductility degradation for the welded joint with CPD was retarded. When the hydrogen-charging current density was 50 mA/cm(2), the hydrogen embrittlement index (I-UE) based on the uniform elongation for welded joint with CPD was 0.33, while that of as-welded joint was 0.53, which indicated that CPD process reduced the sensitivity to HE. The morphology of tensile fracture indicated that brittle cracks initiated at the composite oxide inclusion enriched Al-Mg-Ca-S elements, and propagated radially by quasi-cleavage fracture pattern. The CPD process led to the increase of dislocations acting as reversible hydrogen traps, which significantly enhanced the hydrogen content of welded joint from 1.001 ppm to 2.516 ppm. However, the dislocation walls and cells related to the CPD process hindered the diffusion of hydrogen, and homogeneous distribution of dislocations after CPD dispersed trap sites for capturing hydrogen, which played important roles in delaying hydrogen-induced fracture.

AB Blending green hydrogen into natural gas can effectively promote hydrogen consumption and operational flexibility of electricity-gas coupled networks. However, the volatility of renewable energy sources threatens the operation of green hydrogen production and blending, while existing system-level risk management methods either exhibit over-conservatism or are computationally inefficient when constraints are numerous. Therefore, this paper proposes a correlation-enhanced distributionally robust joint chance-constrained (DRJCC) method for the joint scheduling of electricity and hydrogen-enriched compressed natural gas (E-HCNG) networks, aiming to minimize operating cost while limiting joint violation risk under renewable energy uncertainty. Specifically, before DRJCC, an improved hydrogen fraction model is developed for hydrogen blending, refining the representation of fraction variations by incorporating the buffer effect of line packs. Then, for DRJCC solving, the commonly used Bonferroni approximations are overly conservative in allocating joint violation risks to individual chance constraints, especially when constraints are numerous. To mitigate this, by leveraging strongly violation correlations of operational constraints under affine policies, a grouping-based risk allocation strategy is proposed to reduce the over-conservatism. Theoretical derivations confirm the guarantee of joint violation risk via the proposed method. Additionally, customized transformations are developed to address the non-convexities introduced by variable hydrogen fractions. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

AB This paper describes an experimental hydrogenating treatment on a Ti-6Al-4V fatigue specimen containing an electron beam welding joint. The effect of trace solute hydrogen on the microstructures and fatigue behavior of welded Ti-6Al-4V alloy joints was investigated using an optical microscope, X-ray diffractometer, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope and other methodologies. The results demonstrated that no hydride formed in the hydrogenated weld joint at a hydrogen concentration of less than 0.140 wt%. Internal hydrogen, which was present in the alloy in the form of solid solution atoms, caused lattice distortion in the 13 phase. The fatigue properties of the Ti-6Al-4V weld joint hydrogenated with trace solute hydrogen decreased significantly. The solute hydrogen led to an increase in the brittleness of the hydrogenated weld joint. The dislocation densities in the secondary a and beta phase were higher. Fatigue cracks nucleated at the alpha/beta interfaces. The effect of solute hydrogen accelerated the separation of the persistent slip bands, which decreased the threshold required for fatigue crack growth. Solute hydrogen also accelerated the fatigue crack growth rate. These two factors contributed to the degradation of the fatigue life in the electron beam welded Ti-6Al-4V alloy joints.

AB In this research, the microstructure, electrochemical hydrogen permeation properties, thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) characteristics, hydrogen diffusion and trapping behavior in different micro-regions of L360QS pipeline welded joints were systematically investigated. The results prove that the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of the L360QS pipeline steel welded joints exhibits the highest effective hydrogen diffusion coefficient and the largest amount of diffusible hydrogen compared with those in the weld metal and base metal. The tendency of hydrogen diffusion and accumulation in the HAZ is closely related to the presence of more straight grain boundaries. The straight grain boundaries permit an increase in effective hydrogen diffusion and equilibrium hydrogen concentration. The high grain densities of base metal in fine grains would hinder hydrogen diffusion, resulting in a lower effective hydrogen diffusion coefficient. Due to the presence of polygonal ferrite, pearlite, and granular bainite with a significant number of irreversible hydrogen traps for the weld metal,it hinders hydrogen diffusion and lead to the decrease of diffusible hydrogen content. This research provides a fundamental understanding of hydrogen diffusion behavior which will support the optimization of welding processes for L360QS pipeline in hydrogen-rich environments.

AB The hydrogen embrittlement (HE) mechanism of QP980 steels laser welded joints with complex microstructures is unclear. The joint with hydrogen pre-charging fractured at the inter-critical heat affected zone (ICHAZ) in slow strain rate tensile test, and the relative loss of elongation amounted to 84.8 %. Hydrogen-induced microcracks mainly initiated inside martensite (similar to 60 %). Hydrogen-induced crack propagation paths of the joint were transgranular propagation of martensite and intergranular propagation of ferrite/martensite interface. The HE mechanism of the joint was the combination of the effects in hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity (HELP) and hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE).

Both the notched tensile strength (NTS) and reduction in area (RA) are reduced in hydrogen environments, with the most pronounced ductility loss and brittle fracture characteristics observed in the WM, followed by the heat-affected zone (HAZ) and base metal (BM). Hydrogen exposure leads to a 52.8 % reduction in the fracture toughness of the WM, accompanied by the presence of pronounced secondary cracks on the fracture surface. Microstructural, fractographic, and mechanical analyses revealed that the high hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility of the WM is associated with its microstructural heterogeneity (including acicular ferrite, quasipolygonal ferrite, hard phases such as martensite/austenite (M/A) constituents), the presence of inclusions, and the pronounced anisotropy, all of which contribute to making the WM the most vulnerable region to hydrogen embrittlement.

In the original joint with hydrogen pre-charging, cleavage fracture occurred at the inter-critical heat affected zone (ICHAZ). The IPC process only caused carbides to precipitate in martensite of the ICHAZ. The IPC joint with hydrogen pre-charging (5 min) exhibited ductile fracture at the base material during the slow strain rate tensile test, and the total elongation HE sensitivity of the joint was reduced from 84.6 % to 13.7 %.

Results of threshold stress tests (according to the ASTM E1681 standard) and slow strain rate tension tests (SSRT) of pipe metal in hydrogen and hydrogen-nitrogen mixtures at a pressure of 10 MPa are presented. Steel structure and Vickers hardness distribution along a subcritical crack front are investigated for specimens after crack resistance tests. Structural features of pipe base metal and welded joint metal (weld metal and heat-affected zone), which may affect pipe steel hydrogen embrittlement and values obtained for crack growth during crack resistance tests are considered.

AB To date, the hydrogen diffusion mechanism in the welded joint of high strength steels is poorly understood. A thermal-mechanical-hydrogen diffusion sequentially coupled procedure was built to investigate the hydrogen diffusion behaviors during the whole welding process with considering the nonlinearity of the material and the effects of the phase transformations. By using this modelling, the dehydrogenation of the welding conditions were comparably studied. A first-time numerically observed self-gathering effect occurred during the transformation of undercooled austenite in the cooling process, which caused a hydrogen concentration jump even larger than the initial concentration of the molten pool at the bottom of the weld metal. That significantly influenced the subsequent hydrogen diffusion of the whole welded joint. The retained hydrogen was dominantly driven by the normalized concentration difference. Surprisingly, the stress-assisted diffusion was limited in the joint unless the hydrogen concentration was at a very low level. The hydrogen concentration in both weld metal and heat affect zone should be treated with caution for preventing the hydrogen assisted cold cracking. The results also indicate that there is a more economical and energy saving treatment in contrast with the over conservative ones commonly used in engineering.

AB Over the last decade, press hardening has become all pervasive for automotive body-in-white design. Press-hardened boron micro-alloyed steels are widely used in modern body structure for high safety standard and lightweight achievement. Considering the welding of press-hardened components, some special considerations have to be taken into account compared to conventional deep-drawing steel grades. The mechanical properties of the welded joints are influenced by the hydrogen content in the base metal as well as the weld metal. Hydrogen absorption may result from the press-hardening process, as well as the welding process. Due to the martensitic microstructure and the high strength level, a critical hydrogen content may cause hydrogen embrittlement or hydrogen-assisted cold cracking (HACC). This paper focuses on the determination of the diffusible hydrogen content in the base metal after the press-hardening process, as well as in gas metal arc (GMA) welded joints of 22MnB5. Hydrogen source during press hardening is the humidity at the austenitizing temperature in the furnace atmosphere. During welding, for this study hydrogen was deliberately introduced by hydrogenous fluids on the sheet surface. The diffusible hydrogen content in the base metal and the weld metal was quantified by thermal desorption mass spectroscopy (TDMS) technique. The influence of the diffusible hydrogen on the mechanical properties of the welds was determined by four-point-bend testing. The time to fracture was identified using acoustic emission technique.

The characterization of propagation paths of HIC and HAFC was carried out by OM and EBSD techniques. Mathematical and physical models for fatigue life and diffusible hydrogen concentration were established in X80 pipeline steel welded joint and results showed that the saturation concentration of diffusible hydrogen in X80 pipeline steel welded joint is refined to (19-20) x 10-6 mol/cm3, both HICs and HAFCs are preferentially propagated through fusion line of heat affect zone for the large variety in grain boundary and low KAM values. In addition, MnO inclusions introduced in welding process play an important role in turning away of HAFCs propagation direction despite of the straightforward HICs.

AB A7N01 aluminum alloy is widely used in rail transit industry due to its excellent comprehensive mechanical properties. However, due to its sensitivity to stress corrosion cracking (SCC), especially in hydrogen-containing moisture environment, the mechanical properties of hydrogen-charged A7N01 aluminum alloy friction stir welding (FSW) joints were tested through the tensile testing machine. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to study the tensile fracture morphology. The results indicate that the ductility and tensile strength loss of A7N01 Al alloy FSW joints are large in conditions of charging hydrogen. This is due to the embrittlement of the material caused by hydrogen infiltrating into the grain boundary of the aluminum alloy material.

AB We propose an algorithm for the solution of the problem of heat conduction and hydrogen diffusion with variable coefficients of diffusion and solubility for structurally inhomogeneous materials. As an example, we test the algorithm by solving the problem for bimetallic cylindrical specimens used, according to the ASTM G146-01 standard, for the investigation of the hydrogen resistance of bimetallic joints. We determine the distribution of hydrogen concentration in cylindrical specimens with weld overlay obtained as a result of cooling at different rates after high-temperature hydrogenation. It is shown that, in the fusion zone (on the side of the coating), we observe the formation of the zones of superequilibrium supersaturation with hydrogen, which may result in the exfoliation of the weld overlay from the base metal.

AB A numerical model of a welded joint of the hydrogen storage tank was built. The stresses caused by inner pressure, welding, and autofrettage were investigated. Numerical results showed that complicated welded residual stresses were generated in the weld central line and heat affect zone, which made the stresses in the welded joint increase and fluctuate. In order to improve the stress distribution, the autofrettage process was used after welding. Comparison of stress distribution with and without autofrettage, showed that the autofrettage process caused stresses in the welded joint of the hydrogen storage tank to be more uniform along the wall, and decreased the influence of welding on the total stresses. Therefore, the safety of a high-pressure hydrogen storage tank is improved by the application of autofrettage. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Owing to the scope of large-scale use of hydrogen energy in future technology, addressing safety issues like leakage and diffusion in all steps of production, storage, transportation, etc., will become inevitable. This paper focuses on the volume change of the combustible area after double ferrule joint leaks. First, a calibrated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was built and calibrated for accuracy through a hydrogen horizontal jet process. Second, the schlieren method was used to observe the hydrogen leakage morphology when the pipe was scratched. The CFD model was used to investigate the morphology and combustible volume changes under different wind directions and speeds. Third, critical wind speed (CWS), representing the disturbance wind speed when the combustible volume generated by the hydrogen jet was reduced to 85% of the non-disturbed environment, was proposed. Fourth, the scratch leakage behavior with the double ferrule joint placed horizontally was simulated. This research found that forced convection in the hydrogen system reduced the combustible volume produced by the hydrogen jet, and the typical value of CWS here was 1.5 m/s.(c) 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB Bonding the Zr-4 alloy in the high temperature can lead to many problems, for example grain coarsening and large welding deformation resulting from high residual stresses. Hydrogenation is an effective approach to decrease the bonding temperature. In the present research, the influence of hydrogen contents on the microstructure evolution and shear strength of Zr-4 alloy joints were studied. The number of interface voids markedly decreased with increasing hydrogen content at 650 degrees C. A sound joint was obtained at the hydrogen content of 0.2 wt% hydrogen. This achieved joint had a shear strength of 244 MPa, and the fracture mode of the joint presented the brittle/ductile mixed mode. With the increase of hydrogen content, the flow stress of the hydrogenated Zr-4 alloy decreased due to the decomposition of zirconium hydrides. The plasticity of the joint enhanced with increasing hydrogen content in the view of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) results, and the kernel average misorientation increased from 0.11 degrees to 0.77 degrees . In addition, the diffusion behavior and diffusion coefficient of the Zr atoms were investigated by molecular dynamics simulation. The calculation results showed that hydrogen enhanced the diffusivity of the Zr atoms, and the diffusion coefficient of the Zr atoms accordingly increased by four orders of magnitude. The addition of hydrogen influenced the directly diffusion bonding process through two aspects: improvement of plasticity and enhancement of diffusion ability.

AB Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior of E690 high-strength steel as a weld joint was investigated in artificial seawater. The most vulnerable location and microstructure to HE was verified, and the underlying mechanism was clarified. Results showed that the weld metal with granular bainitic microstructure leads to premature fracture of the entire weld joint under slow strain rate tensile testing with in-situ hydrogen charging. Dislocation slip bands (DSBs) could be preferentially developed in this zone, and HE initiation was induced via dislocation-hydrogen interaction because the weld metal had the lowest local strength among the weld joint. Martensite/austenite (M/A) constituents and carbides could also contribute to crack initiation and propagation through microvoid coalescence and decohesion.

AB This study investigates the tensile properties and hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility of X65 pipeline steel welded joints in hydrogen-blended natural gas environments by slow strain rate tensile (SSRT). The hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility index (IPC1) of each area in the welded joint is calculated using principal component analysis, showing that the heat-affected zone (HAZ) has the highest susceptibility. The hydrogen embrittlement risk increased significantly when the hydrogen partial pressure exceeds 1.5 MPa. This phenomenon is owing to the high hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity of M-A constituents and the lowest activation energy of reversible hydrogen traps in the HAZ. The hydrogen-induced performance degradation mechanism is attributed to the dislocation pinning effect that hydrogen adsorption inhibits dislocation mobility, consequently diminishing the plastic deformation capacity of material.

AB Welded joints of hydrogen-containing coal gas transmission pipelines are prone to hydrogen enrichment due to their severe microstructure inhomogeneity and residual stress in them, and thus lead to the decrease of plasticity and toughness. In order to investigate the effect of local hydrogen enrichment on the safety of hydrogen-containing coal gas transport pipelines, a three dimensional numerical simulation model was established to investigate the hydrogen diffusion behaviour considering the combined effect of microstructure inhomogeneity and residual stress in X80 spiral welded pipeline by using ABAQUS software. Results showed that both microstructure inhomogeneity and residual stress could lead to hydrogen diffusion. The distribution of hydrogen concentration in the pipeline was similar to that of hydrostatic stress distribution. That is, the higher the hydrostatic stress value, the higher the corresponding hydrogen concentration, indicating that the influence of residual stress on the hydrogen diffusion behaviour is greater than that of microstructure inhomogeneity. The enriched hydrogen concentration at the center region of the welded joint with the highest residual stress was 2.7 times higher than that without considering residual stress. Equivalent charging hydrogen pressure was put forward to reflect the degree of hydrogen enrichment in weld metal. Slow strain rate tension (SSRT) tests were subsequently performed on weld metal specimen at equivalent charging hydrogen pressure to investigate the effect of hydrogen enrichment on hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility. The SSRT tests performed in nitrogen gas and simulated coal gas were used for comparison. The HE index increased from 18.56% in simulated coal gas to 32.53% in equivalent charging hydrogen pressure, increasing by 75.27%. Therefore, the residual stress is a non-ignorable factor, because it could lead to hydrogen enrichment and could significantly influence HE susceptibility in welded joint. The determination of hydrogen enrichment in welded joint by using numerical simulation method is the basis to evaluate the safety of coal gas transmission pipeline.

AB Hydrogen and methane commonly co-exist in aquifer. Either hydrogen or methane has been individually utilized as electron donor for bio-reducing chromate. However, little is known whether microbial chromate reduction would be suppressed or promoted when both hydrogen and methane are simultaneously supplied as joint electron donors. This study for the first time demonstrated microbial chromate reduction rate could be accelerated by both hydrogen and methane donating electrons. The maximum chromate reduction rate (4.70 +/- 0.03 mg/L.d) with a volume ratio of hydrogen to methane at 1:1 was significantly higher than that with pure hydrogen (2.53 +/- 0.02 mg/L.d) or pure methane (2.01 +/- 0.02 mg/L.d) as the sole electron donor (p < 0.01). High-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing detected potential chromate reducers (e.g., Spirochaetaceae, Delftia and Azonexus) and hydrogenotrophic bacteria (e.g., Acetoanaerobium) and methane-metabolizing microorganisms (e.g., Methanobacterium), indicating that these microorganisms might play important roles on microbial chromate reduction using both hydrogen and methane as electron donors. Abundant hupL and mcrA genes responsible for hydrogen oxidation and methane conversion were harbored, together with chrA gene for chromate reduction. More abundant extracellular cytochrome c and intracellular NADH were detected with joint electron donors, suggesting more active electron transfers.

AB Hydrogen induced stress corrosion cracking behavior of SUS301L-MT laser-arc hybrid welded (LAHW) joints has been investigated in our previous works. However, the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior in each zone of this joint is still unclear. In this work, in combination with microstructures, cracks propagation paths and fracture surface morphologies analysis, in situ electrochemical hydrogen charging during slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) tests were performed on the specimens cut from base metal (BM), heat-affected zone (HAZ) and weld metal (WM) in SUS301L-MT stainless steel LAHW joints to investigate the HE behavior of each zone. The results indicated that deformation induced martensite transformation occurred in BM and HAZ specimens during SSRT tests, resulted in cleavage morphologies on the fracture center and dimples on other areas. The fracture surface of WM specimen was all covered with dimples. During in situ hydrogen charging, the cracks in BM and HAZ specimens initiated along alpha'/gamma interface near the specimen edge. The cracks in WM specimen initiated along the delta-ferrites distributed at austenitic grain boundaries. After the cracks initiated, the hydrogen concentration distribution in combination with stress field at the front of cracks tips would induce the cracks propagation by "hydrogen enhanced local plastic deformation" and "hydrogen enhanced decohesion" mechanisms. As a result, mainly fracture characterizations of intergranular cracking, transgranular cleavage and secondary cracks formed on the fracture surface.

AB Understanding and solving the problem of hydrogen damage due to the degradation of service performance of high-strength steel caused by hydrogen penetration is a milestone for the reliability improvement of high-end hydrogen energy equipment. From the perspective of microscopic hydrogen movement behavior, this study investigated the permeability of hydrogen in base metal (BM) and welded metal (WM) of 2.25Cr-1Mo-0.25 V steel welded joint through electrochemical hydrogen permeation test, and the analytical models of hydrogen penetration and hydrogen diffusion in the welding zone were established, and the effect of adding hydrogen-resistant coatings (HRCs) on hydrogen movement behavior in steel substrate was studied. The results showed that the diffusivity of hydrogen in WM of the welded joint was significantly lower than that in BM, and the hydrogen concentration in BM was higher than that in WM at the beginning of hydrogenation without the addition of HRCs protection, while it tended to be consistent at the later stage. However, the hydrogen concentration in WM was lower than that in BM after adding HRCs and would be always higher than that in BM after a certain period of time, and the difference was directly related to the hydrogen resistance of the coatings. Additionally, the difference between the intermediate and outer layers for the welding zone steel substrate with and without HRCs presented a trend of rapid increase followed by a slow decrease. These findings could provide an important reference value for hydrogen damage protection measures and related researches on HRCs.

AB The coarse-grained heat-affected zone (CGHAZ) of conventional fusion weld joints such as submerged arc weld is particularly prone to cracking in hydrogen environments. The rotary friction welding (RFW) joint of X60 pipeline steel consists of a weld zone (WZ) and a thermo-mechanically affected zone (TMAZ) and heat-affected zone (HAZ). RFW process can effectively induces recrystallization, forming fine equiaxed grains with grain size consistently smaller than those in the base metal. The average grain size is 5.2 mu m in the base metal whereas it is 4.1 mu m in the HAZ, 2.3 mu m in the TMAZ and 1.6 mu m in the weld zone. The consumption of dislocations during recrystallization of the WZ and TMAZ zones reduces the number of reversible hydrogen traps in these subzones, while the increase fraction of high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) in this weld joint can effectively impedes the crack propagation, collectively improving hydrogen embrittlement (HE) resistance. Slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) tests in a 6.3 MPa hydrogen environment showed that the RFW joint exhibits significantly higher HE resistance than the base metal. The ratio of elongation-to-failure in high-pressure hydrogen gas to that of sample tested in air is 0.97 for the RFW joint, which is considerably better than a value of 0.78 for the base metal.

AB In this study, the fatigue crack growth behavior of X65 welded joints in a natural gas mixed hydrogen environment with a total pressure of 10 MPa and hydrogen volume fractions of 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% was examined. The addition of hydrogen increased the fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR) of X65 welded joints by more than 10 times that of nitrogen. With an increase in the hydrogen volume fraction, the fatigue crack acceleration rate gradually increased, and was proportional to the square root of the hydrogen partial pressure. The fatigue crack propagation performance and hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity of the heat affected zone (HAZ) were the worst, which is related to the distribution of lath bainite (LB) with a high dislocation density and hard, brittle martensite/austenite (M/A) constituents in the HAZ. The mechanism of hydrogen-promoting fatigue crack propagation is that hydrogen promotes dislocation movement and enhances plasticity in the base metal (BM) and weld metal (WM) specimens, whereas it inhibits dislocation mobility and reduces plasticity in the HAZ specimens. Thus, the findings of this study can be expected to support the application of hydrogen transportation in natural gas pipelines.

AB The resistance of dissimilar joints to hydrogen was assessed using fracture toughness in an aggressive environment and slow strain rate tests. Six weld joint conditions were evaluated. To determine the distribution of microconstituents and elements along the interfaces, techniques such as optical and scanning electron microscopy, tomography, and nano hardness were employed. The results demonstrated that the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement is directly linked to the fraction of discontinuous regions present along the dissimilar interface. Additionally, a critical evaluation of the methodology concerning the positioning of stress concentration at the dissimilar interface was carried out, and alternative approaches were presented.

AB Hydrogen embrittlement cracking caused at a weld joint is considered to be dominated by hydrogen diffusion and concentration driven by thermal stress induced by heat transfer during cooling process. The gradient of hydrostatic stress component is considered to be a driven force of hydrogen transportation. However, this problem concerns the occurrence phenomenon during cooling process. Therefore, diffusion coefficient, yield stress and Young's modulus are changed corresponding with temperature change. Especially, diffusion coefficient shows the space gradient corresponding with space gradient of temperature caused by heat transfer. This affects the diffusion equation of hydrogen as a driven force of hydrogen diffusion. Under these backgrounds, to clarify not only the effect of local thermal stress but also that of space gradient of diffusion coefficient on hydrogen release and trap, the hydrogen diffusion analysis based on our proposed alpha multiplication and FEM-FDM methods was conducted by introducing the terms of gradients of diffusion coefficient and temperature into the diffusion equation. The following results were obtained. The space gradient of diffusion coefficient was found to contribute the release of hydrogen from the site of stress concentration when the gradient of local hydrogen concentration takes the same sign as that of diffusion coefficient. Concerning the prevention of hydrogen embrittlement cracking at weld joint, these results show that not only Pre-Heat Treatment (PHT) which is a mechanical factor, but also the space gradient of diffusion coefficient which is a factor of material science was found to be one of effective factor of release of hydrogen from a site of stress concentration.

AB The unit commitment is a promising approach to guide the short-term operation of hydro-based power systems, where hydropower is the only adjustable power. However, the unit commitment is conducted individually for hydropower and hydrogen plants, primarily due to the complexities in simultaneously adjusting hydropower and hydrogen power. The joint unit commitment has seldom been derived for hybrid power systems considering hydropower and hydrogen power simultaneously. This study proposes a joint unit commitment framework that operates both hydropower and hydrogen power to adapt to large-scale photovoltaic power. First, a joint unit commitment model is developed to maximize operation benefit and minimize water consumption. After that, a strategic encoding method is proposed, effectively curtailing the dimensionality of decision variables by considering minimal operating thresholds for unit activation and deactivation. Finally, a two-layer nested approach is proposed to improve calculation efficiency. In the upper layer, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II determines the online number of hydropower and electrolyzer units. The lower layer employs a composite of dynamic programming and the cuckoo search algorithm to derive the power dispatch strategies. Results from China's Longyangxia hydro-hydrogen-photovoltaic hybrid power station indicated that the proposed approach achieved a 1.56 % reduction in water utilization and a 10.34 % enhancement in operation benefit compared with the real operation. Water consumption was 569.65 m3/s in the stochastic operation, and reduced to 567.29 m3/s in the deterministic operation. Therefore, accurate forecast is important in reducing water consumption. These results affirm the proposed joint commitment model attains a balance between water conservation and economic efficiency.

AB The effect of cathodic polarization conditions on hydrogen degradation of X2CrNiMoCuN25-6-3 super duplex stainless steel welded joints, obtained using flux cored arc and submerged arc welding methods, was evaluated. Slow strain rate tensile tests of base material and welded specimens, ferrite content measurements, scanning electron microscopy observations, and statistical analysis were performed. It was found that hydrogenation of super duplex steel welded joints under the conditions of cathodic protection in artificial seawater environment leads to hydrogen embrittlement and that the weld area shows the highest degree of degradation. Welded joints made with higher heat input and under higher current density tend to cause an increase in the degradation of mechanical properties.

AB Hydrogen production through renewable energy-powered electrolysis is pivotal for fostering a sustainable future hydrogen market. In the electricity sector, hydrogen production bears an additional demand that affects electricity price, and mathematical models are needed for the joint simulation, analysis, and planning of electricity and hydrogen sectors. This study develops a Cournot and a perfect competition model to analyze the links of the electricity and hydrogen sectors. In contrast to other solving methods approaches, the Cournot model is solved by convex reformulation techniques, substantially easing the resolution. The case studies, focusing on the Iberian Peninsula, demonstrate the region's potential for competitive hydrogen production, and the advantages of perfect competition to maximize the use of renewable energies, in contrast to Cournot's oligopoly, where the exercise of market power raises electricity prices. Sensitivity analyses highlight the importance of strategic decision-making in mitigating market inefficiencies, with valuable insights for stakeholders and policymakers.

AB The influence of post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) and fatigue damage on the hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity of X80 steel welded joints, obtained using flux-cored arc welding method, was investigated in the study. Compared to the as-welded specimens, the sensitivity of hydrogen embrittlement after PWHT was decreased. However, the coupling effect of PWHT and fatigue damage improved significantly the HE sensitivity. Furthermore, the fracture site of the PWHT + pre-fatigue specimens with hydrogen-charged was transferred to the weld metal, and the fracture was characterized by intergranular fracture, quasi-cleavage (QC) and shallow dimples ductile fracture. The increase of the hydrogen content might be attributed to the evolutions of dislocation and the proportion of high-angle grain boundary caused by fatigue damage. Meanwhile, the size of QC for the hydrogencharged welded joints was related to the degree of fatigue damage, hydrogen content and microstructure strength.

AB Laser-arc hybrid welding (LAHW) process has been applied for excellent manufacturing the new generation subway vehicles underframe using cold rolled SUS301 L stainless steel. However, the effects of hydrogen atoms on the stress corrosion cracking (SCC) behavior are still unclear, which is probably a latent risk for the application. Here, in combination with the microstructures and fracture morphologies analysis, the effects of hydrogen atoms on SCC behavior of SUS301L-MT (MT = 15% cold rolling, middle tensile) stainless steel LAHW welded joints and the base metal (BM) was investigated by slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) method during applied cathode potentials on the specimen in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution. The results indicated that the SUS301L-MT ASS LAHW welded joints exhibited lower SCC susceptibility than that of BM, particularly at very negative cathode potential, -1200 mV and -1400 mV, the SCC susceptibility of the welded joints (similar to 0.3) is 2 times lower than that of BM (similar to 0.6), due to the high solubility of hydrogen atoms and low hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility of weld metal (WM). We hope this study can help to assist LAHW process widely apply for the manufacturing of new generation subway vehicles underframe as well as other welding structures.

AB Welded joints suffer from hydrogen embrittlement (HE) owing to the internal stress generated during welding. Alloying elements play a vital role in the metallurgical behavior of welded joints. In this study, the influence of chromium (Cr) and titanium (Ti) on the HE behavior of welded joints in low -alloy steel was investigated by examining the microstructural morphology, grain characteristics, precipitate particles, engineering stress-strain curves, and fracture modes. The experimental results indicated that, compared with the addition of Cr, the addition of Ti promoted the formation of acicular ferrite in the lower fusion zone (FZ) via Ti -bearing oxides, and refined the grains of the FZ. The strength and elongation of the Ti joint were superior to those of the Cr joint in both air- and hydrogen -containing environments. Furthermore, compared with the addition of Cr, the addition of Ti improved the HE sensitivity. The fracture modes of both the Cr and Ti welded joints changed from ductile to brittle when the prepared joints were exposed to an H -containing environment.

AB Recently, there has been a surge in interest globally for offshore wind-powered hydrogen production (OWPHP) as a sustainable and environmentally friendly approach. To cut the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) of the decentralized OWPHP, we propose a joint optimization model that simultaneously optimizes the wind farm layout and electrolyzer capacity, accounting for the wake effect among turbines. Further, to address the computational complexities, a bi-level distributed decomposition method (BLDDM) is developed, which could decompose the primary problem into several subproblems in a hierarchical and distributed manner, allowing the efficient solution with alternating direction method of multipliers. Case studies are conducted based on actual data to validate the effectiveness of the model, demonstrating that the joint optimization approach would significantly reduce the LCOH compared to the individual approach. Meanwhile, the proposed BLDDM has a better computational performance than the commonly used nonlinear optimization algorithms.

AB In this study, fracture behaviors of base metal and weld metal of ferritic steel welded joint in the thick wall pipeline for hydrogen transportation were investigated and the effects of hydrogen and specimen thickness (B) on fracture toughness were comprehensively considered in detail. A series of single edge notched tensile (SENT) tests for base metal and weld metal with B/W (width) ratio of 0.5, 1 and 2 were conducted with and without preelectrochemical hydrogen charging, and crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) of Sm value was obtained by the double clip gauges method. It was found that fracture toughness (Sm) of base metal and weld metal decreased with increasing specimen thickness or hydrogenating, and Sm of hydrogenating specimen with B/W ratio of 2 was smallest. It was believed that large specimen thickness decreased fracture toughness by constraining plastic deformation at crack tip and restricting dislocations movement, while hydrogen promoted embrittlement by reducing cohesive energy of fracture. In the hydrogenating specimen with larger thickness, there was lower dislocation density near crack tip, leading to a decrease in trapped hydrogen and intensifying the cohesive energy reduction effect, which resulted in reduced Sm and the worse fracture toughness, and it means that hydrogen and specimen thickness synergistically affected fracture toughness. In addition, effect of thickness and hydrogen on decreasing fracture toughness was more pronounced for weld metal than base metal, which could be attributed to poorer plastic deformation ability of weld metal and lower dislocation density at crack tip. It is concluded that the hydrogen and thickness effects should be taken into account for the structural integrity evaluation of welded joint in hydrogen transportation pipeline.

AB In this work, elastic-plastic fracture toughness tests were conducted on X80 base metal (BM), weld metal (WM), and heat affected zone (HAZ) under 12 MPa total pressure with 10 vol% and 30 vol% hydrogen-blended environments. Experimental results revealed that as the hydrogen blending ratio increased from 10 vol% to 30 vol%, the hydrogen-induced fracture toughness KIH values of the BM, WM, and HAZ decreased by 14.6 %, 17.3 %, and 21.4 %, respectively. Within the investigated parameter range, both WM and HAZ exhibited higher hydrogen-induced crack propagation resistance than the BM under identical environments. Based on experimental results, a finite element framework was established to analyze cross-region fatigue crack growth in welded joints under residual stress. Numerical simulations revealed that in 30 vol% hydrogen environments coupled with welding residual stress, the equivalent stress intensity factor Keq at the crack tip in the weld zone exceeds the KIH at 45 % of the wall thickness, posing a fracture risk to the welded joint. Moreover, post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) significantly improves the stress state of welded joints. When the PWHT temperature exceeds 500 degrees C, fatigue cracks maintain stable propagation until reaching 80 % of the wall thickness, with Keq consistently remaining below KIH throughout the crack growth process.

AB Weld joints can experience numerous defects, which may become enriched in hydrogen and form pits after an attack. However, few in situ studies have been conducted on the relationship between hydrogen enrichment and pitting initiation sites. Moreover, the mechanism by which hydrogen enrichment pro-motes the initiation and propagation of pitting is unknown. In this study, the pitting susceptibility of austenitic stainless steel weld joints that had been used for 6 years in a hydrocracking unit was investi-gated. Scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM) was performed to characterize the Volta potential before and after hydrogen removal. The alpha/gamma phase boundaries of the as-received samples were mostly enriched in hydrogen. Furthermore, the alpha/gamma phase boundaries were the preferential locations for the initiation and propagation of pits, which were located at sites of hydrogen enrichment. The results of focused ion beam analysis revealed that the pits deepened along the alpha/gamma phase boundaries and achieved stability. Hydrogen enrichment promotes the transformation of metastable pits to stable pits, which may be the mechanism underlying the promotion of pitting propagation by hydrogen enrichment.

AB The effect of hydrogen on the mechanical properties of X70 welded joint was investigated in simulated natural gas/hydrogen mixtures at 10 MPa. The hydrogen volume fraction was set as 0, 5.0 and 10.0 vol.%. The slow strain rate tensile test showed that the reduction in the area of the welded zone (WZ) metal was reduced more than that of the base metal. The variation in fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR) from high to low followed the order: heat-affected zone (HAZ) metal, base metal and WZ metal. In addition, the difference became more obvious with increasing hydrogen volume fraction. For the HAZ metal, the FCGR in 10.0 vol.% hydrogen mixtures was approximately 22 times of that in nitrogen. Furthermore, based on FCGR and fracture mechanics, the predicted fatigue life of the X70 pipeline with an initial flaw depth of 0.5 mm dropped sharply from 34,302 cycles to 3457 cycles even though 5.0 vol.% hydrogen was added in the simulated natural gas.

AB The transition to the zero-carbon power system is underway accelerating recently. Hydrogen energy and electric vehicles (EVs) are promising solutions on the supply and demand sides. This brief presents a novel architecture that includes hydrogen production stations, fast-charging stations, and commercial EVs. The proposed architecture jointly optimizes the hydrogen energy dispatch and the EV charging location selection and is formulated by a time-varying bilevel bipartite graph (T-BBG) model. We develop a bilevel iteration optimization method combining the linear programming (LP) and the Kuhn-Munkres (KM) algorithm to solve the joint problem whose optimality is proved theoretically. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture on reducing the operating cost is verified via case studies in Shanghai. The proposed method outperforms other strategies and improves the performance by at least 13%, which shows the potential economic benefits of the joint architecture. The convergence and impact of parameters are assessed.

AB This study investigated the hydrogen embrittlement behaviors of three laser welding joints for the 1500 MPa AlSi coated steel using slow strain rate tensile and hydrogen concentration experiments. The results show that LWHT is fractured in the fusion zone without hydrogen charging because the S-ferrite reduces the mechanical properties. With the increase in hydrogen concentration, the fracture location is still FZ. The fusion zone of LWFHT is composed of martensite and retained austenite, and when the hydrogen concentration is 3.4 ppm, retained austenite traps many hydrogen atoms. The newly formed martensite during tensile inheriting the high hydrogen concentration in retained austenite causes cleavage in the fusion zone. When the hydrogen concentration is 13.6 ppm, most hydrogen segregates at the prior austenite grain boundaries, causing an intergranular fracture in the fusion zone. The fusion zone of LWF-HS is composed of martensite and carbide, and grain refinement and nanoscaled Fe3C can reduce HE susceptibility. With the increase in hydrogen concentration, the fracture location is still base materials. The significantly increased hydrogen concentration compared to LWF-HT is mainly trapped in carbides without reducing the banding force of dislocations and grain boundaries. This work provides a scientific basis and technical direction for realizing high-quality laser wire-filling welding of Al-Si coated steel.

AB The effects of the organizational characteristics and morphological distribution of Ti-6Al-4V alloy welded joint on their resistance to hydrogen embrittlement were investigated. The beta-phase continuity of the base material (BM) was poor, and the large volume of the striped alpha-phase hindered hydrogen diffusion. Consequently, the BM has low hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity. The basket-like phase distribution of the weld material (WM) had better beta-phase continuity and higher phase boundary density compared with the BM, providing a more convenient channel for hydrogen diffusion and more hydrogen absorption sites. Therefore, the WM had a high hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity.

AB Welds of thick plates (304 SS) clad with Ti of commercial purity in as-received state and also after subsequent heat treatment and/or after hydrogen charging were investigated. Fatigue tests were carried out at amplitude of 20 Hz and in case of bimetal without hydrogen charging also at amplitude of 40 Hz. After heat treatment, charged welds showed higher threshold level than the welds without heat treatment. Energy dispersed analyses (EDA) of fracture surfaces showed that failure predominantly occurred in joint. Hydrogen induced cracking (HIC) response of bimetal samples demonstrated favourable results both after welding and after subsequent heat treatment. Short and thin cracks were observed, exclusively located in mixed zone, where approx. 16-20 at. % of Ti using EDX (energy dispersed analyser) was revealed. By application of monochromatic synchrotron radiation Ti-alpha, Fe-fcc, Fe-bcc and intermetallic phase Fe2Ti were detected.

AB Recent work on the resource potential of natural hydrogen indicates that it holds great promise as an important component in the energy portfolio by 2050. However, effective exploration strategies for natural hydrogen are yet to be developed. In this study, we developed a workflow to identify prospective areas for natural hydrogen exploration by targeting the serpentinites (serpentinized ophiolite formations) based on their distinct gravity and magnetic signatures resulting from serpentinization, a key geological process responsible for subsurface natural hydrogen generation. Utilizing gravity and aeromagnetic data collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in the Clear Lake Volcanic Field (CLVF) in northern California, we performed three-dimensional (3D) joint inversion and applied geological differentiation techniques to classify and interpret subsurface geological units. By integrating geophysical measurements, surface geological information, and geothermal well measurements, we identified multiple prospective targets within CLVF and estimated the natural hydrogen generation potential. Our work provides a cost-effective approach for natural hydrogen exploration, offering valuable guidance for further investigation and preliminary drilling.

AB The effect of hydrogen charging on the electrochemical behavior, surface properties, and the cracking processes of Ti-6Al-3Nb-2Zr-1Mo (Ti80) alloy base metal and welded joint is investigated. Hydrogen promotes the deterioration of the Ti80 including the destruction of the passive film, formation of the hydrides, initiation of the cracks, and decrease of the mechanical properties. The weld metal show much higher susceptibility to hydrogen because of the finer grains with lamellar structure. Hydrogen embrittlement mechanism differs from the hydrogen introducing approach. The hydrides, internal hydrogen, and hydrogen-stress interaction play different roles in the hydrogen damage process of the Ti80 alloy.

AB The cylinder sections in a high-pressure hydrogen storage tank are usually connected by girth welded joints. However, due to the ultra-thick wall of the cylinder, the weld geometry has a significant influence on the residual stress distributions, which are very difficult to be fully determined by experimental methods. Therefore, in this paper, four sequential coupling two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric finite element (FE) models with different weld geometries have been developed to study the effects of weld groove shape on the residual stresses. In addition, the effects of working pressure (75 MPa) on the welding residual stress distributions have been investigated. The results demonstrate that different weld groove shapes bring different residual stress distributions, leading to different influences on structural integrity. Among the four types of welded joints, V and U types have similar residual stress distributions, and X and d-U types have similar distributions, but the latter two types have large tensile residual stresses at their inner surfaces, which have a greater risk of generating hydrogen induced cracking (HIC). After introducing a working pressure of 75 MPa, the welding residual stresses are redistributed, and the weld regions of the four types of welded joints are all fully yielded and plasticized. Based on the residual stress considerations, using V-shape groove can obtain the best residual stress distributions in an ultra-thick girth welded joint, which provides a reference for the welding and fabrication of a high-pressure hydrogen storage tank.

AB The effect of heat treatment condition and diffusible hydrogen level on microstructure and mechanical properties of multi-pass shielded metal arc welded (SMAW) P91 steel butt joints of 18 mm thickness has been studied. Field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), Mercury diffusible hydrogen measurement, Charpy test, room-temperature tensile testing, hardness measurement and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were performed to characterize the multi-pass SMAW joints in as-welded, post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) and normalizing/tempering (N&T) state. The P91 steel butt joints with low level of diffusible hydrogen exhibited higher tensile strength and toughness. Both PWHT and N&T treatment provided similar mechanical properties but a significant microstructure variation was noticed for different zones of P91 welds. N&T treatment produced the homogenize microstructure along the P91 weldments both in terms of microstructure and micro-hardness. (C) 2017 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

AB Green hydrogen is an attractive option for energy carrier, which can counteract the intermittent nature of renewable electricity production. While the synergy between renewable energy system and hydrogen system in this sense is obvious, its detailed analysis has only recently received attention. In this work, the advantages of joint planning (i.e., simultaneous planning of both energy and hydrogen systems) are analyzed in detail both qualitatively and quantitatively. In this work, a mixed-integer linear programming problem is proposed to this end to make optimal decisions for the combined system of green hydrogen and renewable energy, which we call an integrated supply chain of hydrogen and renewable energy (ISCHRE) system. The objective of such problem is to determine 1) the location and capacity of production, storage, and transportation & transmission facilities, and 2) the hourly operational decisions throughout the year to satisfy both green hydrogen and energy demands, while minimizing the total annualized cost of the entire system. Using the proposed model, the optimal ISCHRE system for South Korea is designed with the target of 10 % penetration of both nationwide hydrogen and electricity production. The national territory of South Korea is divided into five regions, and the decisions within each region and inter-region decisions are extensively analyzed. It was shown that, through joint planning, a significant cost saving can be achieved, showing a 20.8 % reduction in the total annualized cost. Also, despite the reduced renewable production, both hydrogen and energy demands were met through extensive bidirectional electricity transmission, which also decentralized green hydrogen production.

AB The effects of hydrogen addition (0.12 wt% H) on microstructural evolution in Ti-0.3Mo-0.8Ni alloy argon-arc welded joints have been investigated using optical microscope (OM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to reveal the influence of hydrogen on the characteristics of defect-free titanium alloy welded joints. The results show that hydride precipitation changes the initial microstructure of the welded joints. The increase of hydrogen content is favorable for the beta phase precipitation. Face centered cubic delta hydride is evenly distributed in the hydrogenated 0.12 wt% H welded joints. The lamellar delta hydride could only precipitate from the lamellae alpha, and not from the transformed beta phase. Formation of delta hydride is associated with the result of alpha(H) phase separation reaction: alpha(H)->alpha (H lean region) + delta (H rich region), and H rich regions finally transform to the delta phase. The dislocation distribution is heterogeneous and there is a relatively high density of dislocations in the vicinity of the precipitated delta hydride, which are caused by the lattice distortion due to the stress field generated by the hydride precipitation.

AB Ultrafine powders are crucial for the preparation of high-performance Re-based materials via low-temperature sintering. In this work, a joint reduction method of carbon and hydrogen is proposed to prepare Re nanopowder for the first time. The former carbon black can significantly reduce the particle size of final products, and the latter hydrogen reduction can decrease the contents of carbon and oxygen residues. And the as-obtained rhenium nanopowder is only about 108.6 nm with a slight carbon (0.019 wt%) and oxygen (0.03 wt%). This method is straightforward, easy to implement, low-cost and conducive to the large-scale industrial production.

AB This paper investigates the stress corrosion cracking behavior of 2205 duplex stainless steel welded joints under the coupling of hydrogen, corrosive medium and stress. The results show that the presence of hydrogen shifts the fracture location from the base material to the heat affected zone. Cracks initiated at the pitting sites, and the locations of the pitting sites were highly consistent with the stress corrosion cracking locations. This suggests that hydrogen causes the heat affected zone to initiate pitting and further initiates crack initiation and stress corrosion fracture.

AB This paper investigated the effects of welding and alternating wet-dry seawater on the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility of a new nanoparticle-reinforced high-strength steel, dispersion-strengthened-high-strength (DSHS) steel. The results show that welding led to the transformation of granular bainite to tempered martensite. It also promotes grain coarsening as well as an increase in inclusions size and irregular changes in shape. This results in increased susceptibility to HE at the welded joint (WJ). After wet-dry cycle corrosion in seawater, corrosion products impede the oxygen transfer and promote the hydrogen evolution reaction, so the hydrogen production increases. The decrease in the protection of corrosion products at the WJ and the decrease in NbC content led to an increase in hydrogen production but a decrease in hydrogen trapping capacity. Therefore, the WJ HE sensitivity of DSHS steel is further increased. (c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Graphynes are potential hydrogen storage materials due to their unique acetylene bond structure (C-C = C-C), and can be classified into alpha-GY, ss-GY, gamma-GY, sigma-GY, GDY, etc., according to the proportion of their involved acetylene bonds. To enhance their hydrogen storage capacities, four typical graphynes (alpha-GY, ss-GY, delta-GY, and GDY) were modified by a joint Na-decoration and B-doping technique in this research, and the hydrogen adsorption processes of these modified graphynes were investigated by molecular dynamics simulation to clarify the effects of the structure modification on their hydrogen storage capacities. The results showed that the hydrogen storage capacities of the modified graphynes are larger than those of non-modified graphynes, and that the joint Na-decorated and B-doped alpha-GY obtains the largest hydrogen storage capacity of 9.41 wt%. The mechanism of the enhancement of hydrogen storage by the joint Na-decoration and B-doping was found to be that the Na-decoration and B-doping strengthen the adsorption energy between acetylene bonds and hydrogen atoms. Since the modified alpha-GY has satisfactory hydrogen storage capacity, far exceeding the target set by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) in 2020 for portable hydrogen storage system, it can be expected to be a potential hydrogen storage material in the future.

AB As the need for duplex stainless steel (DSS) increases, it is necessary to evaluate hydrogen stress cracking (HSC) in dissimilar welded joints (WJs) of DSS and carbon steel. This study aims to investigate the effect of the weld microstructure on the HSC behaviour of dissimilar gas-tungsten arc welds of DSS and carbon steel. In situ slow-strain rate testing (SSRT) with hydrogen charging was conducted for transverse WJs, which fractured in the softened heat-affected zone of the carbon steel under hydrogen-free conditions. However, HSC occurred at the martensite band and the interface of the austenite and martensite bands in the type-II boundary. The band acted as an HSC initiation site because of the presence of a large amount of trapped hydrogen and a high strain concentration during the SSRT with hydrogen charging. Even though some weld microstructures such as the austenite and martensite bands in type-II boundaries were harmless under normal hydrogen-free conditions, they had a negative effect in a hydrogen atmosphere, resulting in the premature rupture of the weld. Eventually, a premature fracture occurred during the in situ SSRT in the type-II boundary because of the hydrogen-enhanced strain-induced void (HESIV) and hydrogen-enhanced localised plasticity (HELP) mechanisms.

AB The effects of hydrogen on the mechanical properties of 304L keyhole tungsten inert gas welded joint were investigated in the study. The presence of hydrogen resulted in a significant decrease in the macroscopic ductility of the weld metal, and fracture may be initiated at the sites of clustered dislocations due to hydrogen atoms. Moreover, it is found that hydrogen may result in more severe loss in ductility and noticeable decrease in the flow stress and strength of the base metal, because of the interplay between the hydrogen atoms and strain-induced alpha' martensite. Strain-induced alpha' martensitic transformation and phase boundaries in the base metal may provide more sites for the accumulation of hydrogen and dislocations, leading to an appreciable decrease in the ductility and strength of the base metal.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility and influence mechanism of X80 weld joints. Slow strain rate testing (SSRT) under in situ H-charging, combined with microstructure and fracture analysis, was performed on the base metal (BM), weld metal (WM), thermally simulated fine-grained heat-affected zone (FGHAZ) and coarse-grained heat-affected zone (CGHAZ). Results showed that the WM and simulated HAZ had a greater degree of high local strain distribution than the BM; compared to the CGHAZ, the FGHAZ had lower microhardness and more uniformly distributed stress. SSRT results showed that the weld joint was highly sensitive to HE; the HE index decreased in the following sequence: FGHAZ, WM, CGHAZ and BM. The effect of the microstructure on HE was mainly reflected in microstructure, local stress distribution and microhardness.

AB Although hot wire TIG welding improves the speed of deposition compared to TIG welding, it still falls short compared to submerged arc welding. However, adding hydrogen to the protective atmosphere of hot wire TIG welding can further enhance the cladding efficiency. Nevertheless, hydrogen can also deteriorate joint performance and cause defects such as hydrogen cracks. In this study, we investigated the effects of hydrogen on the properties and low-temperature toughness of 9Ni steel joints welded by TIP-TIG for LNG storage tanks. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the joints were analyzed using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and a universal testing machine. The results showed that the TT weld hydrogenated in a protective atmosphere exhibited good strength and low-temperature toughness. The optimal proportion of mixed gas was found to be 98% Ar + 2% H2. At 2% hydrogen content, the width of the weld dendrite and the grain size of the coarse grain region were relatively small, and the fracture surface displayed large and deep dimpling and high cleavage step, resulting in the highest low-temperature toughness. However, when the hydrogen content increased to 8%, micropores were generated in the weld, disrupting the material's continuity and reducing the low-temperature impact energy absorption of the weld, thereby damaging the low-temperature toughness of the molten metal.

AB Hydrogen energy is critical in replacing fossil fuels and achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Three measures can be implemented to promote hydrogen energy: reduce the cost of low-carbon hydrogen through technological improvements, increase the production capacity of low-carbon hydrogen by stimulating investment, and enhance hydrogen use as an energy carrier and in industrial processes by demand-side policies. This article examines how effective these measures are, if successfully implemented, in boosting the hydrogen market and reducing global economy-wide carbon emissions using a global computable general equilibrium model. The results show that all the measures increase the production and use of low-carbon hydrogen, whether implemented alone or jointly. Notably, the emissions reduced by joint implementation of all the measures in 2050 become 2.5 times the sum of emissions reduced by individual implementation, indicating a considerable multiplier effect. This suggests supply and demand side policies be implemented jointly to maximize their impact on reducing emissions.

AB The effect of hydrogen in a 2.25Cr-1Mo-0.25 V steel welded joint was studied using tensile mechanical and hydrogen permeation tests. Hydrogen diffusivity and solubility were determined by electrochemical (room temperature) and gas permeation (350-500 degrees C) tests. The hydrogen permeation curve for the base metal, at room temperature exhibited a strong deviation of sigmoidal shape indicating the influence of deep traps as martensite and austenite phases. The hydrogen solubility at room temperature obtained for the base material was equal to 21.8 molH m(-3). At high temperatures (350-500 degrees C) the apparent hydrogen diffusivity was: D = 1.3.10(-6) exp (-3 2.2 4kJ/mol /RT)m(2) S-1 for the base metal and D = 2.0.10(-7)exp (-27,3+/-3kJ/mol/RT)m(2) s(-1) for the weld metal. Stress strain tests revealed that in the hydrogenated samples, applying elastic stress, there was increase of hydrogen embrittlement of this alloy due to the enhancement of hydrogen solubility.

AB Stress relaxation plays a key role in ceramic/metal joints, and reliable information is crucial for developing multilayer composite fillers and reaching promising joint strengths. There are currently limited relevant experimental studies due to the difficulty in detection. Taking the Al2O3/stainless steel joint as an example, the study gives a new method to unveil the role of elastic-plasticity of sandwich composites in stress relaxation. By using the thermo-hydrogen treatment technology, the joint strength was almost only affected by the thermal mismatch at a fixed brazing parameter, which can be an indirect indicator of stress relaxation. In the meantime, it is a promising method for stress relief. It was found that the joint strength, which corresponds to the residual stress relaxation, was promoted by the presence of hydrogen, which corresponds to the elastoplastic properties of the fillers. This dependency was amplified in the harder/softer/harder structure. Finite element analysis verified the experiment results by calculating the stress concentration, strain energy density, equivalent moment, and shear forces at stress-concentrated regions because the more ductile interlayer had higher strain but lower stress, and easier plastic deformation during the brazing process. The occurrence of dislocation movement, grain boundary slip, stacking fault, and dynamic crystallization played a significant role in the plastic deformation.

AB Fabrication of a bimetallic joint to facilitate a material transition from a 6061-T651 aluminum pressure vessel liner to stainless steel tubing in cryogenic pressure vessels is explored using three different dissimilar metal interlayers with an explosive welding (EXW) process. Due to difficulties in directly EXW joining aluminum (Al) 6061 to 304 stainless steel, interlayers are used to prevent interaction of the aluminum and stainless steel, thus minimizing brittle intermetallic phase formation. Titanium (Ti), copper (Cu), and tantalum (Ta) were selected as the dissimilar metal interlayer materials; each having advantages and disadvantages. Titanium is a commonly used interlayer for this joint, but can microcrack during EXW if the bonding parameters are not correct. Copper has the advantage that it is compatible with hydrogen, but is also known to form brittle intermetallics with aluminum. Tantalum is ductile and bonds well to both Al and stainless steel, and is a high temperature metal that does well to prevent interdiffusion and intermetallic phase formation. However Ta is the most expensive metal of the three. Results of the characterization of the three interlayer bonds showed that Ti produced the highest strength joints, Ta produced the most ductile joints, and Cu produced a joint that failed with low ductility at the Al/Cu interface. Based on these results, the Cu-interlayer joint is not recommended for this application, while the Ti and Ta interlayer bonds both appear to have sufficient strength and ductility for the intended use.

AB In order to investigate stress corrosion cracking (SCC) of X65 pipeline steel and its welded joint area in deep sea environment. The simulated methods were used to obtain the welded joint of hardening and softening tissue in heat affected zone (HAZ) by annealing at 1300 degrees C for 10 min and then, normalized in air and quenched in water respectively; the other was to get 1000 m depths of marine environment. The effect of hydrogen on SCC behavior of X65 pipeline steel in simulated deep sea environment was analyzed by a combination of hydrogen-charging, slow stain rate test (SSRT), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and electrochemistry. Results demonstrated that with the increasing of charging current density, Fracture of as-received appeared brittle characteristics and normalized and quenched steel generated micro cracks, Hydrogen-charging will enhance the SCC susceptibility of the steel in simulated deep sea environment. The corrosion potential of X65 steels was low in deep sea environment with hydrogen evolution reaction and showed some SCC sensitivity in deep sea environment. Heat treatment altered the microstructure of the steel, resulting in a change of SCC susceptibility. In particular, the quenched steel with a bainite micro-structure which had a higher SCC susceptibility than as-received and normalized steel in deep sea environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Currently, the proportion of distributed renewable energy sources in distribution networks is continuously increasing, while electric vehicles (pure electric and hydrogen-powered) are experiencing substantial growth within the transportation network. Addressing how to coordinate the regulation of renewable power generation and guide electric vehicle charging, thereby ensuring secure distribution network operations and enhancing traffic network efficiency, has become an urgent issue. This paper proposes a novel strategy for coordinated regulating the coupled system through adjusting hydrogen flow via a joint electricity price-hydrogen price- charging price mechanism. Electricity prices serve to control the electrical energy flow; hydrogen prices control the hydrogen energy flow; and charging prices control the charging patterns of electric vehicles. Two pricing mechanisms are compared: one considering only electricity prices and charging prices (without hydrogen energy flow), and another incorporating electricity prices, hydrogen prices, and charging prices (with hydrogen energy flow). Based on these pricing mechanisms, two methods are contrasted: a rule-based price updating approach and a reinforcement learning-based DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) price decision method. Results show that in the proposed price mechanism (with hydrogen energy flow) DDPG strategy, the voltage deviation has decreased by 0.007 (p.u.) compared to the old price mechanism (without hydrogen energy flow) rule-based strategy. However, there is no significant improvement observed in terms of transportation network regulation capability, in the proposed price mechanism DDPG strategy, the waiting time and time loss have increased by 2.2% and 1.2% compared to the old price mechanism rule-based strategy. Results reveal that the proposed joint electricity price-hydrogen price-charging price mechanism exhibits superior performance, which can effectively control the electrical energy flow-hydrogen energy flow-traffic flow. However different coupling devices exhibit varying degrees of sensitivity to price changes. In addition, the DDPG method proves more effective. In future research, the main focus is on addressing the insufficient explainability of deep reinforcement learning.

ID OPERATION
AB Due to the significantly differentiated electrolytic hydrogen capacity caused by resource characteristics such as wind, solar, hydro, and thermal power in different regions of China, region joint electrolytic hydrogen systems (RJEHS) considering multiple energy sources is proposed to improve this situation. In this framework, a regional decoupling model is established for typical cascade hydropower in Southwest China to simulate the actual operation of it. Moreover, the advantages of RJEHS compared with region separate electrolytic hydrogen systems (RSEHS) in reducing levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH), carbon emission and the installed capacity of renewable energy power generation are also studied. In addition, differential models considering the power and ramping characteristics of three different types of electrolyzers are established. And the evolution process and development prospect of the planned configuration of the three types of electrolyzers during 2025--2050 are given. The case study verifies the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

AB The modified 9Cr-1Mo-V steel commercially designated as P91 steel have major application in thermal and nuclear power plants for its capability of working in optimum temperature and gas pressure region. A careful joining or welding process of P91 steel is required during its application in thermal and nuclear power plants to avoid different limitation such as evolution of delta ferrite in the fusion zone and its susceptibility to type IV cracking as well as Hydrogen Assisted Cracking (HAC). HAC poses a significant challenge in P91 steel welded joint owing to the undesired formation of martensitic metallurgical transformations during welding process. This present study investigates the impact of different induction assisted heat treatment conditions on HAC of P91 welded joint. The susceptibility of HAC was evaluated through implant test, amount of diffusible hydrogen in the weld metal and numerically estimated tensile residual stress. Implant test results were analyzed to find out lower critical stress and Critical Stress Ratio. The microstructure of the coarse grain heat affected zone and weld metal under various conditions was investigated using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Finally, a correlation was established between different induction assisted heat treatment condition with diffusible hydrogen content and tensile residual stress for assess the hydrogen assisted cracking susceptibility. The findings clearly indicate that P91 steel welded joint without any pre/post heating is more susceptible to HAC. However, implementation of induction assisted preheating and post heating effectively reduced the amount of diffusible hydrogen, tensile residual stress and lowers down the susceptibility of HAC. The results suggested that induction assisted GMAW followed by induction post heating could be recommended for the welding of P91 steel.

AB In addition to the well-known case of spherical coordinates, the Schrodinger equation of the hydrogen atom separates in three further coordinate systems. Separating in a particular coordinate system defines a system of three commuting operators. We show that the joint spectrum of the Hamilton operator, the z component of the angular momentum, and an operator involving the z component of the quantum LaplaceRunge- Lenz vector obtained from separation in prolate spheroidal coordinates has quantum monodromy for energies sufficiently close to the ionization threshold. The precise value of the energy above which monodromy is observed depends on the distance of the focus points of the spheroidal coordinates. The presence of monodromy means that one cannot globally assign quantum numbers to the joint spectrum. Whereas the principal quantum number n and the magnetic quantum number m correspond to the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization of globally defined classical actions a third quantum number cannot be globally defined because the third action is globally multivalued.

AB A single-pass laser welding process was conducted on a 20 mm thick X80 pipeline steel plate utilizing a 30 kW ultra-high-power fiber laser. The study investigated the effects of various welding process parameters on the microstructure, mechanical properties, and corrosion resistance of the welded joints. The electrochemical method was employed to assess the hydrogen absorption capacity of both X80 pipeline steel and its welds under electrochemical hydrogen charging conditions. Additionally, the corrosion behavior of X80 steel and its welds in a 3.5% NaCl solution following electrochemical hydrogen charging was examined by x-ray diffraction and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results indicate that the microstructure of weld zone primarily consists of ferrite and bainite. The hardness value in this region decreases progressively with increasing laser power, exhibiting the highest hardness at the bottom section along the thickness direction. Additionally, tensile strength diminishes as laser power increases, with peak values observed in the middle section of the thickness direction. Notably, the mechanical properties of these joints are significantly enhanced compared to those of the base metal. In terms of corrosion resistance, welds demonstrate slightly inferior performance relative to that of the base metal; furthermore, their corrosion resistance declines with rising laser power. Both diffusible hydrogen concentrations in the base metal and welds exhibit a similar upward trend as hydrogen charging time extends. A saturation level for diffusible hydrogen concentration is reached after 12 h of charging. Under identical hydrogen charging conditions, larger grain sizes and an increased number of hydrogen traps within the weld render it more susceptible to hydrogen absorption than its base metal counterpart. In terms of the impact of hydrogen on corrosion behavior, an increase in both the hydrogen charging current density and the duration of hydrogen charging exacerbates the corrosion characteristics of both the base metal and weld. Furthermore, it is observed that the corrosion resistance exhibits minimal variation with prolonged hydrogen charging time. Moreover, under equivalent conditions, electrochemical responses reveal that welds are less affected by hydrogen charging compared to base metals; thus indicating superior corrosion resistance for welds over their corresponding base metals. The corrosion products observed before and after hydrogen charging are primarily composed of alpha-FeOOH, alpha-Fe2O3, and gamma-FeOOH. Following hydrogen charging, the welds exhibit a relatively higher content of alpha-FeOOH, which serves to impede matrix corrosion to some extent.

AB Pitting corrosion of austenitic stainless steel weld joints served in a hydrocracking unit for 6 years was examined. The microstructure of weld metal (WM) and fusion line (FL) was austenite and ferrite. After the immersion test, many pits were observed on the FL, whereas few pits were observed on the heat-affected zone (HAZ). Pits were microscopically initiated at ferrite/austenite boundaries. Hydrogen concentrations at FL and WM were higher than those of HAZ, and hydrogen segregation occurred at ferrite/austenite boundaries, which was consistent with the pit position. Hydrogen enrichment conditions varied under different microstructures, which induced the difference in pitting susceptibility.

AB Heavy metal ions and micro(nano)plastic pollution have attracted increasing attention. However, their toxicological effects on endogenous reactive species at molecular level are unclear, especially their joint effects. Hence, two typical environmental poisons, mercury (Hg-2(+)) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), posing significant risks to both human health and ecosystems, are selected as pollution models for studying joint effects. Hydrogen polysulfides (H2Sn, n > 1) play crucial roles in removing oxidants and intracellular electrophilic reagents, involved in regulating intracellular redox state. The understanding of its precise biological role and intricate mechanism action remains limited, especially suffering from exogenous environmental stress. Herein, we have developed a novel H2Sn- responsive fluorescence probe P-Y with outstanding performance. Moreover, probe P-Y could image endogenous H2Sn levels in cells, and was successfully applied for monitoring the fluctuations of endogenous H2Sn levels to investigate their effects on redox homeostasis under Hg2+ and PMMA single and combined exposure. This study provided imaging evidences and an absorbing insight for understanding H2Sn function under Hg2+ and PMMA single and joint effects in living organisms.

ID POWER; STORAGE
AB In view of the rough modeling of hydrogen energy system, insufficient analysis of hydrogen energy utilization mode, and the lack of consideration of the multiple uncertain factors, this paper proposes a joint optimization method of planning and operation for integrated electrothermal and hydrogen coupling system (IEHS) based on multiverse optimizer algorithm (MVO) and interval linear programming method. Firstly, the frame structure of IEHS is constructed, and multiple utilization modes of hydrogen energy are analyzed. Secondly, considering the hydrogen physical characteristics, the operation model of high-pressure hydrogen storage device based on Van Deemter equation is established, and the linear model of compressor power consumption is built considering dynamic compression ratio. On this basis, the bilevel optimization model of planning and operation for IEHS is established considering multiuncertainty and multiple hydrogen energy utilization modes. The upper model realizes the capacity configuration of equipment with the goal of minimizing the total construction and operation cost within the service life. The lower model optimizes the output of each equipment with the goal of minimizing the operation cost. The example results show that MVO and interval linear programming method for solving the bilevel optimization model have the better convergence speed and convergence ability. Further, the multiple utilization modes of hydrogen energy can effectively reduce the construction and operation cost of IEHS, and accurately depicting the physical characteristics of the hydrogen storage system can increase the coordination and optimization ability of IEHS. Considering multiple uncertain factors, the optimal configuration scheme and operation cost of IEHS are more stable.

AB This paper discusses the effect of different combinations of preheating and post-heating on the corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement of Grade-91 steel weld joint in the as-welded condition. Though these welds are subjected to post-weld heat treatment (PWHT), there could be long delay in executing this, especially in the case of fabrication of large components, and during this delay, the welds in as-welded conditions are prone to environmental degradations like hydrogen embrittlement and different forms of corrosion. Though recommended minimum preheating and post-heating conditions are already known for welding of this class of steels, marginally increasing the temperature of preheating and post-heating or increasing the duration of post-heating can permit longer delay in the post-weld heat treatment (PWHT), without increasing the risk of environmental degradation. With this objective, a set of thirteen single-V multi-pass gas tungsten arc weld joints of Grade-91 steel fabricated with different preheating and post-heating combinations. Results indicated a significant reduction in residual tensile stresses in the weld metal and reversing into compressive stresses upon preheating and post-heating at 300 degrees C. Moreover, diffusible hydrogen content and corrosion rate decreased significantly with the preheating and post-heating. However, there are no significant variations in the microstructure, mechanical properties, and hydrogen embrittlement with preheating and post-heating. This study proved that the risk of embrittlement in Grade-91 steel welds due to an indefinite delay in PWHT could be minimized by combined preheating and post-heating.

AB The hydrogen-induced stress corrosion cracking (SCC) behaviour and mechanism of U75V welded joints (WJs) immersed in 3.5 wt% NaCl/hydrogenated solutions were investigated using slow strain rate tensile testing and electrochemical measurements. The WJs exhibited more negative potentials, higher corrosion current densities, slightly higher strength, and higher susceptibility to SCC in a hydrogenated solution than the base metal (BM). The strength and elongation of the WJs and BM significantly decreased after exposure to NaCl/hydrogenated solutions. These findings demonstrated that although U75V is extensively utilized in railway tracks, it is imperative to exercise corrosion protection measures for joints or employ specific corrosion-resistant rails in extreme applications to reduce service risks.

AB The effects of hydrogen content and microstructure inhomogeneity on the fatigue crack growth (FCG) behavior of Ti-0.3Mo-0.8Ni alloy argon-arc welded joints were elucidated in detail. Sheets with a thickness of 10 mm were welded using gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). Samples with varying hydrogen content were prepared using a hydrogen charging technique. The crack growth path and fracture morphology were examined using optical and scanning electron microscopies. FCG rate and fracture toughness tests were conducted to analyze the FCG behavior of welded joints. The results indicated that the hydrogen content and microstructure inhomogeneity of the welded joint had limited effects on the FCG rate in the Paris zone. However, as the hydrogen content increased, the FCG rate in the instability zone increased, and the fracture toughness (KQ) value decreased. The microstructure had a greater effect on the FCG rate in the instability zone; the fluctuation amplitude of the FCG path increased significantly, and brittle fracture intensified. Lamellar alpha in the weld zone (WZ) provided an ideal interface for plastic slip, whereas the hydride accelerated separation from the matrix and formed a diffusion channel, significantly increasing the FCG rate in the instability zone. Cracks in the base metal (BM) primarily propagated along the grain boundary of equiaxed alpha. In the WZ, cracks predominantly propagated along the alpha/beta phase boundary or the hydride and cut through the hydride or alternating lamellar alpha/needle beta grains. The fracture morphology in the fatigue source and Paris zones featured a petal-like pattern with partial fatigue bands and cleavage-like river patterns with local brittle fracture and fatigue bands, respectively. In the instability zone, the morphology was characterized by ductile tearing with brittle fracture or local ductile tearing.

AB Under the "carbon peak and carbon neutrality" goal, the construction of an efficient, low-carbon, and economical energy supply system is of great significance for advancing a dual carbon strategy. In allusion to the integrated energy systems (IES) with hydrogen energy coupling, a hydrogen energy coupling IES low-carbon optimization operation strategy that took account of green certificate and ladder-type carbon joint trading and dual-incentive demand response was proposed in this paper. First, a hydrogen energy multiuse system composed of an electrolyzer, a hydrogen fuel cell, a methane reactor, and hydrogen energy storage was constructed to make full use of the low-carbon cleaning characteristics of hydrogen energy. Besides, a combined model of hydrogen mixed with natural gas was established to improve the utilization efficiency of hydrogen energy. Second, a dual-incentive demand response model including price incentives and subsidy incentives was constructed to fully use the ability to adjust demand-side resources. Next, in view of the carbon emission reduction mechanism of the green certificate, a green certificate and ladder-type carbon joint trading mechanism was constructed. In addition, a green certificate trading mechanism and a reward and punishment tiered carbon trading mechanism had been introduced separately in the IES optimization operation model to reduce carbon emissions of the system. The calculation simulation sets up different scenarios for comparative analysis. As shown by the results, the proposed model could effectively improve renewable energy consumption capacity and energy utilization efficiency. The effectiveness of hydrogen energy utilization, demand respond, and green certification carbon trading mechanism in improving system economy and low-carbon efficiency is verified.

AB Due to the frequent movements and bending of joint areas such as ankles, knees and wrists, effective wound closure and healing of the skin at joints and moving parts remains a great challenge. Traditional invasive wound closure methods, such as the use of sutures and skin staplers, often result in additional puncture wounds, side effects of anesthesia and severe scarring. Herein, a highly-stretchable, adhesive, transparent and hygroscopic hydrogel for noninvasive joint wound closure is reported. The hydrogel is composed of N-[Tris (hydroxymethyl) methyl] acrylamide (THMA), polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) and sodium alginate (SA). THMA contains C--C double bonds and a large number of hydroxyl groups, which can form an interpenetrating network structure with PEGDA and SA through chemical and physical double cross-linking. This hydrogel driven by hydrogen bonds exhibits over 700 % elongation and strong adhesion to various surfaces through energy dissi-pation effects. As a wound repair material, the THMA/PEGDA/SA hydrogel can not only effectively close wounds at moving parts, but also provide a mechanical microenvironment similar to normal skin tissue, promote wound healing and reduce scarring. In addition, the hydrogel can effectively absorb exudate, keep the wound moist and clean, and the transparent appearance facilitates the observation of the wound condition. This adhesive hydrogel is demonstrated to be a promising candidate for wound closure and healing at joints and moving parts.

AB Operating rule curves offer a promising approach to guide the operations of hydro-based power systems, such as reservoirs and hydro-photovoltaic hybrid power systems. Nevertheless, the joint operating rule curves have seldom been derived for the hydro-hydrogen-based power systems, primarily due to the complexities in simultaneously adjusting hydropower and hydrogen power. This study is developed to derive the operating rule curves for a hydro-hydrogen-wind-photovoltaic hybrid power system. First, a long-term operation model is built to maximize the guaranteed rate, as well as the total operation revenue obtained from both power generation and hydrogen production. Subsequently, eight operating rule curves are developed to guide the hybrid operation using the inflection point method. Finally, the parameters of operating rule curves are derived using the non- dominated sorting genetic algorithm II under the parameterization-simulation-optimization framework. China's Ertan hydro-hydrogen-wind-photovoltaic hybrid power system served as a case study, and the results indicated that the proposed method could effectively derive the operating rule curves. Compared with the traditional operation, the average operation revenue and guaranteed rate of the optimal operating rule curves increased to 4.50 billion CNY kWh (+17.19%) +17.19%) and 0.99 (+11.24%), +11.24%), respectively. These findings indicate that the proposed operating rule curves achieve a commendable balance between economy and reliability.

AB Cracking failure of Incoloy 800H welded joints used for about eight months occurred in hydrogen reformer outlet pigtail tubes. Visual inspection, microscopic examination, chemical composition and microhardness testing were performed to find out the failure mechanism. The results indicated that microcracks were discovered in the fusion zone and heat affected zone (HAZ). The crack propagation mode was intergranular and irregular. The cracked regions were occupied with some oxides in the fusion zone. The Cr content at the grain boundaries was abnormal and intergranular oxidation was found in the HAZ. The microcracks in the outlet pigtail tubes were caused by stress relaxation, and oxidation at grain boundaries. The intergranular oxidation caused the embrittlement at the grain boundaries during long-term service. From the investigations, it was believed that the failure of welded joints in the outlet pigtail tubes originated from stress relaxation cracking during high temperature service.

AB As onshore installation capacity is limited, the increase in the number of offshore wind turbines (OWT) is a major goal. In that connection, the OWTs continuously increase in size and weight and demand adequate foundations concepts like monopiles or tripods. These components are typically manufactured from welded mild steel plates with thickness up to 200 mm. The predominant welding technique is submerged arc welding (SAW). In accordance with the standards, the occurrence of hydrogen-assisted cracking is anticipated by either a minimum waiting time (MWT, before non-destructive testing of the welded joint is allowed) at ambient or a hydrogen removal heat treatment (HRHT) at elevated temperatures. The effectiveness of both can be estimated by calculation of the diffusion time, i.e., diffusion coefficients. In this study, these coefficients are obtained for the first time for a thick-walled S420G2+M offshore steel grade and its multi-layer SAW joint. The electrochemical permeation technique at ambient temperature is used for the determination of diffusion coefficients for both the base material and the weld metal. The coefficients are within a range of 10(-5) to 10(-4) mm(2)/s (whereas the weld metal had the lowest) and are used for an analytical and numerical calculation of the hydrogen diffusion and the related MWT. The results showed that long MWT can occur, which would be necessary to significantly decrease the hydrogen concentration. Weld metal diffusion coefficients at elevated temperatures were calculated from hydrogen desorption experiments by carrier gas hot extraction. They are within a range of 10(-3) mm(2)/s and used for the characterization of a HRHT dwell-time. The analytical calculation shows the same tendency of long necessary times also at elevated temperatures. That means the necessary time is strongly influenced by the considered plate thickness and the estimation of any MWT/HRHT via diffusion coefficients should be critically discussed.

AB To address environmental problems such as global warming, improvements in fuel efficiency, motor performance, and collision safety are required. Therefore, weight reduction, high strength, and rigidity have been prioritized in automobile bodies. In this regard, a multimaterial body composed of steel and aluminum alloys has been developed. To evaluate the reliability of a multimaterial body, the effect of hydrogen, which significantly contributes to delay failure, on its strength characteristics must be clarified. In this study, we investigated the evolution of mesoscopic and microscopic damages during tensile shear tests on clinched joints, with and without hydrogen charging. Subsequently, cross-sectional observations and fractography were conducted. The cross-sectional observations showed that cracks initiated at lower loads in the hydrogen-charged specimen, as compared to those in the uncharged specimen. Additionally, longitudinal cracks appeared only on the cross section of the hydrogen-charged specimen. At lower loads where crack initiation was confirmed, submicro voids were observed on the cross section. The fractography results indicated a layered fractured surface with submicro dimples on the hydrogen-charged specimen and a general ductile fractured surface with voids on the uncharged specimen. These results indicate that hydrogen causes the damage to evolve from primarily void coalescence to longitudinal crack coalescence. Additionally, prior to the formation of a main crack and longitudinal cracks, submicro voids are initiated. These initiation and growth mechanisms indicate that even on plastic deformation joints, hydrogen enhances localized plasticity and damage evolution, thereby reducing tensile shear strength.

AB Herein, the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility of base material and gas metal arc welds from a high-strength low-alloy steel grade S690QL by slow strain rate test (SSRT) with in situ hydrogen charging is investigated. To investigate the influence of welding process parameters on the HE susceptibility of welded joints, gas metal arc welds in multilayer technique with two different heat inputs are conducted. The results reveal a considerable loss of fracture elongation for all hydrogen-charged specimens when compared with the uncharged reference conditions. If the higher heat input is chosen, the required minimum yield strength in the weld metal (WM) is not achieved. It is remarkable that this WM also revealed increased HE susceptibility as measured by the relative elongation loss, despite its higher ductility associated with the lower strength level. In combination with hydrogen measurements and fracture surface analysis, the crack propagation mechanisms and related HE mechanisms are intensively discussed.

ID POWER-SYSTEM FLEXIBILITY; RESERVE
AB Power systems are striving for the decarbonization goal for long-term sustainability. As a result, the renewable energy sources (RES) have been playing an increasingly important role in the generation portfolio. Power system flexibility maintaining the power balance under uncertain and variable RES generation has become a major concern during the energy transition. This paper proposes to apply new energy vehicles (NEV) including electric vehicles (EVs) and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) as day-ahead flexibility resources to make revenue by providing comprehensive capacity/energy flexibility in the ancillary service market. First, the detailed joint optimized operational strategies of the NEV fleet and the EV charging/hydrogen refuelling stations are formulated. Second, the design and service clearing methodology of the ancillary service market for flexibility enhancement is introduced. A game-theoretic model is applied to determine the equilibrium price for both the demand and suppliers (namely NEV fleets) of operational flexibility. Third, case studies using IEEE benchmark systems are provided to validate the proposed methods. The results demonstrate that the joint optimization of NEV fleets, charging stations, and hydrogen refuelling stations can improve the power system operational flexibility, reduce the charging expense of NEV owners, and reduce the carbon emission by utilizing the green hydrogen.

AB The stress corrosion cracking behavior of an Incoloy825/X65 bimetallic composite pipe welded joint in wet hydrogen sulfide (H2S) environment was investigated by means of the creviced bent beam (CBB) test in this study. The microstructure, element distribution and crack propagation behavior of the welded joint were analyzed by optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The results showed that two types of cracks were observed in the Incoloy825/X65 bimetallic composite pipe welded joint in wet H2S environment, they initiated from the notch and the intersection of the three zones (cladding Incoloy825, base X65 and weld), respectively, and propagated along the fusion boundary(FB) and the Type-II-like grain boundary. The mechanisms of the two types of cracks are due to the combination of anodic dissolution, stress and hydrogen. Near the FB, there are high angle grain boundaries, Type-I, Type-II and the Type-II-like grain boundaries, which have high SCC sensitivity. The element distribution in the intersection of the three zones and the crack tip is complex, with element diffusion, Cr loss and large residual strain. All these provide the conditions for cracks initiation and propagation.

AB It is demonstrated, using tandem mass spectrometry and radio, frequency ion trap, that the adsorption of a H atom on the gold dimer cation, Au2H+, prevents its dissociation and allows for adsorption of CO. Reaction kinetics are measured by employing a radio frequency ion trap where Au-2(+) and CO interact for a given reaction time. The effect of a hydrogen atom is evaluated by comparing reaction fate constants measured for An(2)(+) arid Au2H+. The theoretical results for the adsorption of CO molecules and their reaction characteristics with Au-2(+) and Au2H+ are found to agree with the experimental findings. The joint investigations provide insights into hydrogen atom adsorption effects and consequent reaction mechanisms.

AB A relationship between carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been described in different pathological conditions, but their interaction in modulating joint pain has not yet been investigated. In young female mice with monosodium acetate-induced joint degeneration and pain, we assessed: (1) the effects of CORM-2 (tricarbonyldichlororuthenium(II)dimer), a CO-releasing molecule, and CoPP (cobalt protoporphyrin IX), an inducer of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), administered alone and combined with low doses of two slow-releasing H2S donors, DADS (diallyl disulfide) and GYY4137 (morpholin-4-ium 4-methoxyphenyl(morpholino) phosphinodithioate dichloromethane complex) on the mechanical allodynia and loss of grip strength provoked by joint degeneration; (2) the role of Nrf2, NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and HO-1 in the antinociceptive actions of H2S donors; (3) the impact of DADS and GYY4137 treatment on the expression of Nrf2 and several antioxidant proteins in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and periaqueductal gray matter (PAG). Our data showed that treatment with H2S donors inhibited allodynia and functional deficits, while CORM-2 and CoPP only prevented allodynia. The Nrf2 pathway is implicated in the analgesic actions of DADS and GYY4137 during joint degeneration. Moreover, the co-administration of low doses of CORM-2 or CoPP with DADS or GYY4137 produced higher antiallodynic effects and greater recovery of grip strength deficits than those produced by each of these compounds alone. The activation of the antioxidant system caused by H2S donors in DRG and/or PAG might explain the enhancement of antinociceptive effects. These data reveal a positive interaction between H2S and CO in modulating joint pain in female mice.

AB The bonding between titanium alloy and carbon fiber reinforced thermal plastic (CFRTP) has become a favorable approach to realize lightweight fabrication in the aviation and locomotive industries. However, the metal-plastic bonded joints were generally weak. Different from the traditional interfacial bonding mechanism, the role of hydrogen bonds between functional groups at the metal-plastic interface is currently of great interest. In this work, laser joining of Ti-6Al-4V (TC4) to CFRTP was performed. To enhance the bonding strength, surface modification including micro-arc oxidation (MAO) and silane coupling agent (SCA) treatment were adopted. The results indicated that porous structure after the MAO process could increase TC4 surface roughness and promote mechanical interlocking of TC4 surface to the molten CFRTP substrate. Simultaneously, the porous structure enhanced the adsorption content of hydroxyl groups on the surface of TC4 significantly, which optimized the chemical condition of TC4 surface. Selected silane coupling agent of.-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (KH550) could directionally introduce amino groups (-NH2) to TC4 surface, while maintaining the physical morphology of TC4 surface. Hydrogen bonds were thus induced between functional groups, which were proved by red- and blue-shift of typical functional groups wavenumber. The interfacial bonded force reached maximum value of 1813 N, which was further increased by 29.96% due to the interaction of hydrogen bonds.

AB The effect of hydrogen addition on compression deformation behaviour of Ti-0.3Mo-0.8Ni alloy argon-arc welded joint has been investigated. Evolution mechanism of hydrogen-induced flow stress was discussed in detail. The results show that with increasing hydrogen content, the stretching and bending extent of fully lamellar microstructures including alpha lamellas and acicular hydride continued to increase, the morphology of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) grains tended to change from approximately equiaxed to large lamellar shape, and the quantity of DRX grains and recrystallization degree of grains increased obviously. A large number of dislocations concentrated in the vicinity of the hydride. Steady stress was decreased continuously with increasing hydrogen content, while peak stress of the hydrogenated 0.12 wt.% H weld zone was decreased to the minimum value and then increased slowly. A slight decrease in flow stress of the hydrogenated 0.05 wt.% H weld zone was caused by limited increase in the volume fraction of softer beta phase. Hydrogen-induced DRX of alpha phase and improved dislocation movement by strong interaction between the hydride and dislocation directly resulted in a sharp drop in flow stress of the hydrogenated 0.12 and 0.21 wt.% H weld zone. Solute hydrogen also finitely contributed to a sharp drop in flow stress of the hydrogenated 0.12 and 0.21 wt.% H weld zone by promoted local softening, which induced continuous DRX and more movable dislocations to participate in slipping or climbing. The reinforcement effect and plastic deformation of the hydride and solution strengthening of beta phase induced by solute hydrogen finally led to the increase in flow stress of the hydrogenated 0.21 wt.% H weld zone in its true strain range from 0 to 0.36.

AB With the emergence of distributed resources (DRs), developing an effective, profitable, and green management method is of great importance. Virtual power plant (VPP) can aggregate various DRs, optimize their schedules, and participate in electricity markets uniformly to earn profit. The optimal scheduling problem in spot market has been widely studied, however, few studies have extended the services of VPP to the long-term scale. This paper proposes a coordinated scheduling method for a multi-energy virtual power plant (MEVPP), considering the integration of hydrogen facilities. A holistic market framework, including capacity market, energy market (EM), and ancillary service market (ASM) is developed jointly for the coordination among the annual capacity schedule, daily energy schedule, and daily reserve schedule of MEVPP. A hybrid hydrogen storage system including daily hydrogen storage and seasonal hydrogen storage is modeled to achieve both intraday and cross-seasonal peak shaving. Stochastic programming is used to tackle the uncertainties and risk management is considered by conditional value at risk. With the help of numerical analysis in case studies, it can be concluded that the proposed coordinated scheduling method can improve the economy of MEVPP. The profit from joint market decreases the total cost by about 52 %. The capacity adequacy and flexibility of MEVPP can be improved by the coordination of capacity and reserve services. The hybrid hydrogen storage system can realize the efficient integration of hydrogen and increase hydrogen production and consumption by about 9 %.

AB This study introduces a hydrogen and electricity joint production system that utilizes a very-high-temperature reactor and integrates the iodine-sulfur cycle with the steam Rankine cycle. The system can operate under off-design conditions by adjusting the helium mass flow rates in the main and secondary loops, using constant pressure operation (CPO) or sliding pressure operation (SPO) for the power generation loop. The system's performance is investigated at partial reactor thermal power. The recommended reactor thermal power load ratios range from 63.90 % to 100 % for CPO and from 64.29 % to 100 % for SPO, with the lower limit determined by the steam generator's hot-end temperature difference. The hydrogen production rate and the system's electrical power output both decline with a lower load ratio. Within the recommended load ratios, the hydrogen production rates for CPO and SPO range from 129.44 mol/s to 200 mol/s. With a lower load ratio, the power generation efficiency declines, while the hydrogen-electricity efficiency and system's exergy efficiency first rise and then fall. At a fixed load ratio, the power generation efficiency, hydrogen-electricity efficiency, and system's exergy efficiency are higher using SPO than those using CPO, indicating better off-design performance using SPO.

AB Seawater electrolysis is one of the cost-effective techniques for producing hydrogen. To reduce the initial cost of hydrogen production plants, it is necessary to employ appropriate materials for electrodes, seawater storage, joints, and cell body. We recommend using A516 steel for seawater storage, and cell body. A516 steel is a medium-carbon steel with high strength and wear resistance, easy to work with, 6 times cheaper than stainless steel 316, and is widely used in oil and gas industry. However, it is prone to corrosion. For that, we developed an anticorrosion coating with high thermal and mechanical stress tolerance. The proposed coating is a room-temperature-vulcanizing (RTV) silicone mixed additives, adhesion promoter and fillers. The utilized adhesion promoter enhanced the adhesion by 5-fold, aluminum trihydrate (ATH) decreased the burning distance from 17 mm to 3 mm, and nanoparticles increased the contact angle to more than 160 degrees and contact angle hysteresis less than 3 degrees. The formulated superhydrophobic coating decreased the corrosion rate of A516 steel by 1673-fold from 200 mm/year to 0.12 mm/year. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Constructing compact direct Z- and S-scheme heterostructures is an efficient strategy for realizing a highly efficient charge separation and photocatalytic performance. However, the stochastic nature of interface orientation and lattice mismatch often results in a blind region for effective inner charge transfer, which hinders the logical design of compact heterojunctions. Here, experimental results and theoretical research unveiled that complicated internal charges can be directly transferred to an intermediate cocrystal plane for electron-hole recombination in compact S-scheme heterostructures, called "bone-joint" heterostructures, which facilitate the establishment of an inherent electric field to drive charge transfer. Moreover, those bone-joint structures adjust the inherent chemical and energetic interactions that manipulate the reactant adsorption mode and surface reaction energy. As a result, a synthesized catalyst displayed a remarkable hydrogen peroxide production performance and stability. This offers a paradigm for intrinsic charge transfer dynamics in heterostructures and a guiding philosophy for designing efficient heterostructures.

AB Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in joint fluid acts as a signal molecule to regulate joint inflammation. Direct detection of H2S in joint fluid is of great significance for the diagnosis and treatment of arthritis. However, due to the low volume of joint fluid and low H2S concentration, existing methods face the problem of the insufficient limit of detection. In this study, a highly sensitive biosensor was proposed by designing a primer probe and combining it with hybrid chain reaction (HCR) under the strong interaction between metal ions and H2S to achieve H2S detection. The primer probe containing multiple cytosine (C) sequences was fixed on a gold electrode, and the C-Ag-C hairpin structure was formed under the action of Ag+. In the presence of H2S, it can combine with Ag+ in the hairpin structure to form Ag2S, which leads to the opening of the hairpin structure and triggers the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) with another two hairpin structures (H1 and H2). A large number of double-stranded nucleic acid structures can be obtained on the electrode surface. Finally, Ru(phen)(3)(2+) can be embedded into the double chain structure to generate the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) signal. The linear response of the H2S biosensor ranged from 0.1000 to 1500 nM, and the limit of detection concentration of H2S was 0.0398 nM. The developed biosensor was successfully used to determine H2S in joint fluid.

TI Component test for the assessment of delayed hydrogen-assisted cracking
   in thick-walled SAW joints for offshore applications
SO WELDING IN THE WORLD

DT Article
DE Hydrogen; Cold cracking; Submerged arc welding; Offshore; Thick plates
ID RESIDUAL-STRESSES; MOCK-UP
AB Offshore wind turbines continuously increase in size and weight and demand adequate offshore foundations concepts like monopiles, tripods, or jackets. These components are typically constructed using submerged arc welding (SAW) with high-strength thick steel plates like the S420ML. During welding, the occurrence of delayed hydrogen-assisted cracking (HAC) must be anticipated. HAC is a critical combination of the local hydrogen concentration within a susceptible microstructure under certain mechanical load, i.e., the occurring (welding) residual stresses. The welding sequence of the thick-walled plates complicates the residual stress distribution due to the necessary repeated thermal cycling, i.e., welding seam/layer deposition to fill the joint. For that purpose, SAW with two-wire-technique was used to weld a specially designed and prototype-like mock-up of a real component with a thickness of 50 mm, filled with over 20 passes and a seam length of 1000 mm. Additional welded stiffeners simulated the effect of a high restraint, to achieve critical HAC conditions. The necessity of a minimum waiting time (MWT) before the NDT can be conducted (to exclude HAC) was critically verified by the application of ultrasonic testing of the welded joint at different time-steps of the NDT of up to 48 h after the completion welding. The residual stresses were determined by a robot XRD goniometer. Tensile residual stresses up to the yield limit are found both in the weld metal and in the heat-affected zone. Numerical modeling allowed the qualitative estimation of the hydrogen diffusion in the weld. No noticeable HAC occurrence was identified and confirms the high cracking resistance of the investigated material. Finally, the applicability of the MWT concept should be critically discussed.

AB The embrittlement mechanisms of the X65 weld joint (WJ) in H2S were investigated using in situ crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) test, electrochemical measurement, weight loss test, and hydrogen permeation test. The weld metal (WM), coarse-grained heat-affected zone (CGHAZ), and base metal (BM) exhibited significant degradation of fracture toughness in H2S, with embrittlement factors (EF) of 89.5 %, 83 %, and 80 %, respectively. The WJ exhibited the lowest corrosion potential in H2S compared to the isolated WM and BM. Notably, the weight loss test revealed a corrosion step along the fusion line (FL), indicating the galvanic corrosion in the CGHAZ. This led to different embrittlement mechanisms associated with hydrogen embrittlement (HE) and anodic dissolution (AD). Hydrogen-assisted plastic strain localization in grain boundary ferrite (GBF) resulted in HE-driven cleavage cracking in the WM. In contrast, as galvanic corrosion was promoted, the fracture toughness degradation of CGHAZ was governed by the combined effects of HE and AD. The crack propagation followed a cyclic process of cleavage-blunting-reactivation, corresponding to a fracture morphology of alternating cleavage planes and "trench-like" ductile tears. The HE accelerated the cleavage cracking along the {110} plane, while AD inhibited crack tip blunting through preferential dissolution along the {100}, {110}, and {112} planes.

AB A comprehensive and hierarchical optimization of a joint hydrogen and syngas combustion mechanism has been carried out. The Keromnes et al. (Combust Flame, 2013, 160, 995-1011) mechanism for syngas combustion was updated with our recently optimized hydrogen combustion mechanism (Varga et al., Proc Combust Inst, 2015, 35, 589-596) and optimized using a comprehensive set of direct and indirect experimental data relevant to hydrogen and syngas combustion. The collection of experimental data consisted of ignition measurements in shock tubes and rapid compression machines, burning velocity measurements, and species profiles measured using shock tubes, flow reactors, and jet-stirred reactors. The experimental conditions covered wide ranges of temperatures (800-2500 K), pressures (0.5-50 bar), equivalence ratios (phi = 0.3-5.0), and C/H ratios (0-3). In total, 48 Arrhenius parameters and 5 third-body collision efficiency parameters of 18 elementary reactions were optimized using these experimental data. A large number of directly measured rate coefficient values belonging to 15 of the reaction steps were also utilized. The optimization has resulted in a H-2/CO combustion mechanism, which is applicable to a wide range of conditions. Moreover, new recommended rate parameters with their covariance matrix and temperature-dependent uncertainty ranges of the optimized rate coefficients are provided. The optimized mechanism was compared to 19 recent hydrogen and syngas combustion mechanisms and is shown to provide the best reproduction of the experimental data. (C) 2016 The Authors.

DE hydrogen energy storage; two-stage P2G; adjustable thermoelectric ratio
AB With the continuous development of hydrogen storage systems, power-to-gas (P2G) and combined heat and power (CHP), the coupling between electricity-heat-hydrogen-gas has been promoted and energy conversion equipment has been transformed from an independent operation with low energy utilization efficiency to a joint operation with high efficiency. This study proposes a low-carbon optimization strategy for a multi-energy coupled IES containing hydrogen energy storage operating jointly with a two-stage P2G adjustable thermoelectric ratio CHP. Firstly, the hydrogen energy storage system is analyzed to enhance the wind power consumption ability of the system by dynamically absorbing and releasing energy at the right time through electricity-hydrogen coupling. Then, the two-stage P2G operation process is refined and combined with the CHP operation with an adjustable thermoelectric ratio to further improve the low-carbon and economic performance of the system. Finally, multiple scenarios are set up, and the comparative analysis shows that the addition of a hydrogen storage system can increase the wind power consumption capacity of the system by 4.6%; considering the adjustable thermoelectric ratio CHP and the two-stage P2G, the system emissions reduction can be 5.97% and 23.07%, respectively, and the total cost of operation can be reduced by 7.5% and 14.5%, respectively.

AB Transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, particularly MoS2, are known as promising alternative non-precious hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts to high-cost Pt. However, their performance is strongly limited by the poor conductivity and lack of active sites in the basal plane. Therefore, it is desirable to find alternatives with active basal plane sites or develop facile strategies to optimize the inert basal plane. In this work, we study the HER over topological semimetal Nb2S2C based on its basal plane. We report the first successful activation and optimization of the basal plane of Nb2S2C by synergistic using trivial surface states (SSs) and nontrivial topological surface states (TSSs). We find that the binding strength towards hydrogen adsorption of the easily cleaved sulfur(S)-terminated Nb2S2C surface can be stronger than that of 2H-MoS2, attributing to the presence of trivial SSs and nontrivial TSSs in Nb2S2C. By creating S vacancy on the basal plane, the binding strength towards hydrogen adsorption can be greatly optimized. The TSSs together with dangling-bonds reduce the Gibbs free energy to 0.31 eV, close to the peak of the volcano plot. This study provides a promising strategy for the joint utilization of the basal plane trivial SSs and TSSs for the HER. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB ASTM A 182 F22 steel, used in components subsea for oil extraction, are previously buttered with ductile metal such as Inconel 625, before being welded to steel pipes similar to ASTM A36 steels. The thermal buttering weld cycle provides the formation of high hardness micro-phases and carbides at the interface between F22 steel and the buttering with Inconel, which when in contact with hydrogen, originating from the cathodic protection applied to these equipment, can lead to the embrittlement of this region, causing fragile fractures. In this work, ASTM A 182 F22 steel, buttered with Inconel 625 and welded to A36 steel, submitted to post-weld heat treatment without hydrogenation and subjected to cathodic protection for hydrogen permeation were submitted to fracture toughness test. The welds and buttering were done using GMAW process with AWS ERNiCrMo-3 wire as filler and buttering metal and a mixture of Ar and He as shield gas. The results indicated a 56% of area reduction, and 15% in the elongation values in the tensile tests, in addition to a 13.3% reduction in the CTOD value, for welded joints subjected to hydrogen permeation, which showed a quasi-cleavage fracture mechanism.

AB As operating temperatures and times continue to increase for solder joints with Ni pads, large voids inevitably form at the intermetallic compound (IMC) - solder interface when the IMC thickness nears 5 mu m. This leads to a significant reduction of strength, thermal conductivity, and fatigue resistance, and in small joints, also to electromigration life degradation. We have identified the voiding root cause as the breakdown and subsequent outgassing of deposition-related Ni-oxo-hydroxide impurities, impractical to avoid during Ni commercial electroplating. This work takes as the starting point a successful post-deposition voiding-mitigation treatment with 24-hour annealing at 450 degrees C. It then explores the possibility of rendering this routine more practical by lowering the annealing temperature down to 250 degrees C. While that approach shows relatively limited success, an alternative strategy, involving treatment with hydrogen evolution reaction for one hour at room temperature, alone or in combination with thermal, leads to a substantial reduction in the voiding propensity.

AB The hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility and hydrogen permeation behavior of reeling pipeline welded joint with/without cyclic plastic deformation (CPD) were studied using the electrochemical hydrogen charging technique. Results indicated that the surface of welded joint emerged hydrogen-induced damage containing cracks and blisters. The degree of hydrogen-induced damage increased with the increase of hydrogen charging time and current density. When the hydrogen charging current density and time was 50 mA/cm2 and 4 h, respectively, the area ratio of hydrogen-induced damage of overall welded joint with CPD process was reduced from 6.61% to 2.28%, and the damage ratio of different sub-zones in welded joint was also decreased. The oxidized inclusions enriching Al-Mg-Ca elements acted as the initiation sites for hydrogen-induced damages. The effective diffusion coefficient of as welded joint was 2.63 x 10-6 cm2/s, while that of welded joint with CPD showed a smaller value of 1.36 x 10-6 cm2/s. The welded joint with CPD process presented better resistance to HE, which was attributed to the increased density of hydrogen traps and the formation of dislocation cells to disperse hydrogen uniformly and reduce the possibility of local accumulation and recombination of diffusible hydrogen. Sub-zones in welded joint without CPD process were considerably more sensitive to hydrogen-induced damage, which indicated the important role of microstructure and dislocation density in HE mechanisms. The order of HE susceptibility from low to high was weld metal, base metal and heat affected zone.

AB Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and it is a leading cause of disability in the elderly. Its complete etiology is not known although there are several metabolic, genetic, epigenetic, and local contributing factors involved. At the moment, there is no cure for this pathology and treatment alternatives to retard or stop its progression are intensively being sought. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a small gaseous molecule and is present in sulfurous mineral waters as its active component. Data from recent clinical trials shows that balneotherapy (immersion in mineral and/or thermal waters from natural springs) in sulfurous waters can improve OA symptoms, in particular, pain and function. Yet, the underlying mechanisms are poorly known. Hydrogen sulfide is also considered, with NO and CO, an endogenous signaling gasotransmitter. It is synthesized endogenously with the help of three enzymes, cystathionine gamma-lyase (CTH), cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MPST). Here, the expression of these three enzymes was demonstrated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and their protein abundance [by immunohistochemistry and Western blot (WB)] in human articular cartilage. No significant differences were found in CBS or CTH expression or abundance, but mRNA and protein levels of 3-MPST were significantly reduced in cartilage form OA donors. Also, the biosynthesis of H2S from OA cartilage, measured with a specific microelectrode, was significantly lower than in OA-free tissue. Yet, no differences were found in H2S concentration in serum from OA patients and OA-free donors. The current results suggest that reduced levels of the mitochondrial enzyme 3-MPST in OA cartilage might be, at least in part, responsible for a reduction in H2S biosynthesis in this tissue and that impaired H2S biosynthesis in the joint might be a contributing factor to OA. This could contribute to explain why exogenous supplementation of H2S, for instance with sulfurous thermal water, has positive effects in OA patients.

AB The effects of pre-strain on hydrogen embrittlement of 304L K-TIG welded joint were investigated. As pre-strain of joint increased, fracture location of hydrogen-charged joint changed from weld metal to base metal. In low prestrained joints, fracture may be initiated at the sites of clustered dislocations due to hydrogen in weld metal with a high density of pre-existing dislocations. In high prestrained joints, some regions in base metal suffered severe strain-induced alpha' martensitic transformation due to Ni depletion bands and cracking occurred at phase boundaries where may provide more sites for the accumulation of hydrogen atoms and dislocations.

AB Hydrogen dissolved from the moisture or the wire filler is formed on the surface of welded joint due to the driving of high-energy heat source. The diffused hydrogen in the welded joint could cause hydrogen embrittlement (HE). The important factors determining the HE resistance of welded joints are microstructure style, dislocation distribution, grains characteristics, precipitate particle, and residual stress. Different welding technologies show various heat sources and heat cycles, which result in different characteristics of fusion zone and heat-affected zone. Thus, the HE fracture behavior of welded joint produced by different welded technologies differs greatly. The current stage of HE behavior of welded joint was reviewed to provide fundamental reference for the scientists and engineers engaging in welding. The appearance of hydrogen atoms in the surface or interior of welded joint could weaken the bonding strength and change the fracture mode from ductile to sudden brittle fracture. Generally, the controlling of filler wire and heat input is a practical route to obtain the excellent welded joint with high HE resistance. The inhibition of hydrogen diffusion via the formation of fine coating and the aggregation of hydrogen atoms via the control of microstructure and precipitates are the effective routes to improve HE resistance.

AB The joint effect of the non-ideality (NI) of classical plasma and a static electric field on the energy levels of the hydrogen atom has been investigated theoretically. A two-parameter pseudopotential, derived from Bogolyubov chain equations, is used to model the interactions of the charged particles in classical non-ideal plasma (NICP). Energies of the bound states are computed variationally by employing a trial wavefunction, which is a linear expansion of the accurate eigenstates representing the bound states of the hydrogen atom embedded in NICP. The computed bound state energies of the atom under the combined influence of NICP and a static electric field are found to be convergent with respect to the expanding size of the wavefunction. A comprehensive study is made on the changes emerging in the energy levels due to the variation of the NI of plasma as well as the strength of the electric field. It is found that the effect of the electric field on the non-degenerate ground state is reciprocally opposite to the effect of NICP. The effect of the electric field can be neutralized by increasing the NI of the plasma. Moreover, degeneracy in the azimuthal quantum number pertaining to the excited states is lifted either by the influence of the plasma or by the influence of the electric field. When the effects of the plasma and the electric field are taken together, extended splitting of the energy levels is observed. (c) 2025 Author(s).

AB The susceptibility of various sections of a gas distribution pipeline, operated for 52 years, to hydrogen embrittlement was analyzed. The specimens of base metal and welded joint, cut out transversally to the pipe generatrix, were tested. The brittle fracture resistance was assessed based on temperature dependences of impact toughness and changes in steel plasticity after its electrolytic hydrogen charging. Critically low impact toughness was determined for both the base metal and welded joint of the operated pipeline. It was revealed that preliminary electrolytic hydrogen charging caused the plasticity loss, which was more pronounced for the welded joint and the operated state of the material.

AB Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) occurs as a result of hydrogen atom ingress and causes a significant decrease in plasticity and strength, making it a crucial failure mode in high-strength low-alloy steels. The microstructure plays a vital role in HE fracture behavior because of the various hydrogen trappings. The welding thermal cycle and alloying elements determine the great difference of the microstructure of the welded joint. Thus, this article reviews the current studies investigating the role of the microstructure in determining the HE behavior of the welded joints, thereby aiming to reveal the fracture process and mechanism. Dislocations and inclusions in welded joints reduce HE resistance. Acicular ferrite with a fine interlocking structure can block the prolonging of hydrogen-induced cracking. The transformation of the retained austenite with a high concentration of hydrogen atoms into martensite accelerates HE fractures. The delta-ferrite in the welded joint promotes the HE resistance deterioration and hydrogen-induced cracking. Appropriate coating of the steel surface is an effective approach for preventing HE fractures.

DE TC4 titanium alloy; welded joint; slow strain rate tensile tests;
   hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility
AB The microstructure of tungsten-inert-gas (TIG)-welded TC4 titanium alloy joints was analyzed. The stress-corrosion behavior and hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility of the welded joints were also studied by performing slow strain rate tensile tests (SSRTs) in 3.5% NaCl solution. The results show that the heat-affected zone was mainly composed of alpha, beta, and alpha' phases, in which the alpha' phase comprised a coarse-grain region with a reticulated morphology. During tensile tests, the stress-corrosion sensitivity of the welded joints increased with increasing strain. The greatest stress-corrosion sensitivity occurred at a strain rate of 0.24 mm/min, where the joint fractured at the fusion line. Regarding the hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity, the fracture strength of the joints increased and the elongation percentage decreased with increasing polarization potential. In addition, the fracture surface was primarily composed of dimples, showing that the joints were not sensitive to hydrogen embrittlement.

AB Hydrogen induced cracking (HIC) susceptibility of the welded X100 pipeline steel was evaluated in NACE "A" solution at room temperature according to the NACE TM0284-2011 standard. Both the kinetic parameters of the permeability (J(infinity)L), the apparent diffusivity (D-app) and the concentration of reversible and irreversible hydrogen in the base metal and welded joint of X100 pipeline steel were quantitatively investigated by hydrogen permeation test. The results showed that the welded joint with an inhomogeneous microstructure had a higher trap density and more susceptible to HIC due to two orders of magnitude larger in the concentration of irreversible hydrogen than that of base metal, though all presenting poor HIC resistance for both base metal and the welded joint. The HIC cracks initiated from the inclusions enriching in Al, Ca, Si, Mn. The cracks are primarily trans granular, accompanying with limited intergranular ones.

AB Hydrogen (H-2) shows promise as an energy carrier in contributing to emissions reductions from sectors which have been difficult to decarbonize, like industry and transportation. At the same time, flexible H-2 production via electrolysis can also support cost-effective integration of high shares of variable renewable energy (VRE) in the power system. In this work, we develop a least-cost investment planning model to co-optimize investments in electricity and H-2 infrastructure to serve electricity and H-2 demands under various low-carbon scenarios. Applying the model to a case study of Texas in 2050, we find that H-2 is produced in approximately equal amounts from electricity and natural gas under the least-cost expansion plan with a CO2 price of $30-60/tonne. An increasing CO2 price favors electrolysis, while increasing H-2 demand favors H-2 production from Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) of natural gas. H-2 production is found to be a cost effective solution to reduce emissions in the electric power system as it provides flexibility otherwise provided by natural gas power plants and enables high shares of VRE with less battery storage. Additionally, the availability of flexible electricity demand via electrolysis makes carbon capture and storage (CCS) deployment for SMR cost-effective at lower CO2 prices ($90/tonne CO2) than for power generation ($180/tonne CO2). The total emissions attributable to H-2 production is found to be dependent on the H-2 demand. The marginal emissions from H-2 production increase with the H-2 demand for CO2 prices less than $90/tonne CO2, due to shift in supply from electrolysis to SMR. For a CO2 price of $60/tonne we estimate the production weighted-average H-2 price to be between $1.30-1.66/kg across three H-2 demand scenarios. These findings indicate the importance of joint planning of electricity and H-2 infrastructure for cost-effective energy system decarbonization. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB Pipeline steels for sour oil and gas containing H2S generally suffer from either hydrogeninduced cracking (HIC) or sulfide stress corrosion cracking (SSC). Oil and gas containing high concentration H2S are noxious to pipeline steels because of the hydrogen- induced corrosion. In this study, HIC susceptibility of welded MS X70 pipeline steels was evaluated in NACE "A" solution at room temperature. Meanwhile, microstructure and regions near a HIC crack in the MS X70 base steel and its welded joint were analyzed through OM, SEM and EBSD. The hydrogen trapping efficiency was also investigated by measuring the permeability (J(infinity)) and the effective hydrogen diffusivity (D-eff). The results showed that both base metal and welded joint were highly susceptible to HIC and the later steel sample was more vulnerable than the former. This higher susceptibility could be primarily attributed to the following effects: the higher hydrogen trapping efficiency of bainitic lath microstructure in the welded joint; the more low angle grain boundary in the welded joint also made it easier to crack by improving the hydrogen trapping efficiency of high angle grain boundary; the less amount of coincidence site lattice grain boundary and Sigma 13b. Sigma 29b lead to higher HIC susceptibility by decreasing the resistance to crack of high angle grain boundary.

AB The effects of hydrogen concentration, heating rate and bonding temperature on dissimilar diffusion bonding of Ti2AlNb-based and Ti-6Al-4V alloys were investigated. The microstructural evolutions of bonded joints and substrates during the diffusion bonding were observed using SEM and EDS while the mechanical properties of the joints were evaluated by shear tests. The average joint shear strength was found dependent on the diffusion zone width determined from EDS line scan. The typical joint interface shows a layered microstructure, comprising Ti2AlNb substrate, continuous beta layer, discontinuous alpha layer, equiaxed beta layer and Ti-6Al-4V substrate. If both substrates are hydrogenated with 0.2 wt% hydrogen before diffusion bonding, a sound joint can be formed at 850 degrees C with a fast heating rate. This sound joint has a shear strength of 711 MPa, and its Ti-6Al-4V substrate favors a non-damaged bimodal microstructure. The fast heating rate also causes less hydrogen desorption and oxidation during the heating stage, which facilitates the subsequent diffusion bonding process. The hydrogen addition influences the diffusion bonding process through three main routes including plasticity improvement, diffusion ability enhancement and microstructure tailoring.

AB The effects of elapsed time following gas metal arc welding (GMAW) on the static strength of lap fillet-welded joints were investigated using a static tensile test. It was observed that the static joint strength did not exhibit a time dependency for cases where the fracture was located in each base metal or the softened heat affected zone (HAZ). in addition, the static joint strength was not observed to have a time dependency for cases where a wire with low-hardness weld metal was used and where the fracture was located in the weld metal. However, the static joint strength was low immediately after welding, and increased over time when a wire with high-hardness weld metal was used. It was found that diffusible hydrogen that entered the weld metal during arc welding and was emitted over time was the cause of the time dependency of joint strength. High-hardness weld metal was sensitive to diffusible hydrogen; therefore, time dependency was observed only when wires with high-hardness weld metal were used and the fracture positions were located in the weld metal during tensile tests. In addition, a correlation between the storage temperature following welding and the static strength or diffusible hydrogen content of welded parts was found: the higher the storage temperature, the earlier the joint strength increases, and the earlier the diffusible hydrogen decreases.

AB Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility is intrinsically linked to the material's microstructural characteristics. This study systematically investigated API X52 pipeline steel through in-situ tensile testing under 6 MPa hydrogen pressure, complemented by microstructural characterization, fractographic analysis, and hydrogen microprint test (HMT). A comparative assessment of hydrogen embrittlement resistance was conducted between base metal and welded joints, particularly on microstructural influences on failure mechanisms. It was found that under a 6 MPa hydrogen environment, the hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity of the API X52 base metal selected in this article is higher than that of the welded joint. A gradient microstructural distribution was observed along the direction of the pipe wall thickness. The outer wall region predominantly consists of polygonal ferrite with a minor fraction of granular bainite. A progressive increase in bainitic phase fraction was detected toward the inner wall, ultimately transitioning to bainite structures. Secondary cracks appear on the tensile fracture surface of the base metal under a hydrogen pressure of 6 MPa. The cracks mainly originate from granular carbides and propagate along the grain boundaries. HMT analysis revealed preferential hydrogen segregation at the carbide or grain boundary. The precipitated carbides at grain boundaries play a significant role in hydrogen trapping, and the hydrogen accumulation at the interface between precipitated carbides and the matrix is the main reason for transgranular fracture. The tensile fracture of the welded joints in nitrogen and 6 MPa hydrogen environments was found in the softened zone of the heat-affected zone. The failure mode of the welded joint was mainly dominated by strength and had no hydrogen-induced failure characteristics.

AB In this study, the hydrogen embrittlement and fracture mechanism of friction stir welded Q&P980 steel were investigated systematically. It was found that the intercritical heat affected zone was most susceptible and the stir zone was resistant to hydrogen embrittlement. The hydrogen-induced cracks initiated and propagated along the grain boundaries of ferrite and martensite or inside the martensite. This was attributed to the strain and stress concentration caused by the martensite and ferrite and the large-angle grain boundary formed during thermal cycle of welding process. With the charging time increased from 10 min to 16 h, the strength decreased by similar to 5% whereas the elongation decreased from 10.2% to 3.1% dramatically, which indicated that the hydrogen diffused into the joints had serious effect on elongation. At lower strain rates (1 x 10(-5) s(-1)), hydrogen moved with dislocations and accumulated which promoted the initiation of microcracks and occurrence of fracture ultimately. The fracture surfaces changed from ductile mode for uncharged weld joint to brittle mode for charged weld joint. In addition, the TRIP effect of retained austenite in SCHAZ during tensile test process aggravated the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement which accelerated the nucleation and propagation of hydrogen-induced cracks, and thus intergranular fracture occurred in charged weld joints.Y

AB Zr-4 alloys were hydrogenated by gaseous hydrogen charging and then diffusion bonded using pure Ti interlayers to maintain a low bonding temperature while obtaining high strength. The effects of the hydrogen content and holding time on Zr-4-xH alloys (x represents the hydrogen content in wt.%) and their joints were investigated. Results show that the added hydrogen enhances the diffusion behavior during bonding and the joint quality. The layer growth rates and interdiffusion coefficients at the Ti/Zr-4-xH interlayer were calculated using the empirical power function and the Boltzmann-Matano method to confirm the diffusion enhancement. The flow stress and Young's modulus were also measured, demonstrating the improvement in plasticity. Specifically, the diffusion layer thickness (14.5 mu m) and shear strength (353 MPa) of the joint (0.5 wt% hydrogen, bonded at 700 degrees C and 15 MPa for 60 min) were 16% and 178% higher than those in the case without hydrogenation, respectively. This pre-hydrogenation method reduces the bonding temperature and improves the joint strength, thus advancing the industrial application of Zr alloys.

AB Addressing hydrogen embrittlement (HE) in the welded joints of high-strength pipeline steels is critical for ensuring the safety and integrity of future hydrogen transmission networks. Due to complex thermal cycles during welding, the heterogeneous microstructure and residual stresses render these joints the most susceptible component of the pipeline structure. This paper presents a systematic review of the current state of research on the HE susceptibility of pipeline steel weldments. The review first evaluates mainstream HE theories, such as Hydrogen-Enhanced Decohesion (HEDE) and Hydrogen-Enhanced Localized Plasticity (HELP), concluding that the synergistic interaction between multiple mechanisms is key to understanding the failure process. A comprehensive comparison of multi-scale characterization techniques, from macroscopic mechanical tests to microscopic hydrogen mapping, is then conducted, underscoring the necessity of an integrated framework to accurately assess HE risk. Furthermore, the influence of critical material factors-including phase constituents, grain boundary characteristics, dislocation density, and precipitates-on HE sensitivity is thoroughly analyzed. Ultimately, this review aims to establish a comprehensive analytical framework for HE failure in welded joints, providing a theoretical basis and technical guidance for the development of advanced, hydrogen-resistant welding technologies.

AB Tungsten-argon arc welding (TIG) of Zr-702 zirconium plate was carried out with 99.999% high purity Ar as shielding gas and the corrosion resistance of Zr-702 welded joint immersed in 15wt% sulfuric acid at 250 degrees C for 2 and 180 d was studied by static isothermal mass loss method. The results show that the corrosion rate of the welded joint is higher than that of the base metal in the immersion test for different time. When soaking for 2 d, both the welding joint and the base metal have good corrosion resistance. The corrosion resistance of welded joints deteriorates when the soaking time is extended to 180 d, and the corrosion rate of welded joints is greatly affected by the soaking time. Further analysis results show that the corrosion of base metal in sulfuric acid medium is mainly uniform. For welded joints, a large amount of zirconium hydride is precipitated in the weld zone and heat-affected zone, showing the characteristics of hydrogen corrosion. At the same time, the welded joint exhibits remarkable gradient structure and potential difference, so its corrosion is local corrosion combined with galvanic corrosion and hydrogen corrosion.

AB Hydrogen induced cold cracking (HICC) and hydrogen embrittlement (HE) are influenced by themicrostructural evolution, residual plastic strain (i.e. local misorientation), recrystallization of grains and the resultant grain boundary characteristic distribution (GBCD) brought about by welding processes. HICC and HE are known to cause failures in aerospace components and it is vitally important to quantify the microstructural evolution, degree of residual plastic strain and determine the GBCD across dissimilar weld joints in order to assess the susceptibility of the weld joint to these phenomena. In this investigation a full a microstructural characterization study was carried out at various locations within and around a dissimilar weld joint of pulse-plated nickel (PP-Ni) and Inconel 718 (IN718), taken froman aerospace component. Areas examined included the base metals, weld fusion zone and heat affected zones on both sides of the weld joint, formed via electron beam welding. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in combination with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) was employed to measure the residual plastic strain, grain structure, grain size distribution, crystal orientation distribution, grain boundary misorientation distribution and GBCD of the dissimilar metal weld joint. Finally ametallurgical examinationwas carried out using SEMon the IN718 HAZ in order to investigate the secondary phase precipitation arising fromthe welding process. The results shows large variety of GBCD, crystallographic orientation distribution, local plastic strain distribution and grain size, shape and structure distribution across dissimilar weld joint. And these localized microstructural characterized data sets need to be carefully transferred using data-driven approach in order to develop predictive multiscale material modelling for hydrogen induced cracking and hydrogen embrittlement.

AB To reveal the influence of hydrogen on the characteristics of defect-free titanium alloy welded joints, the effects of hydrogen addition on the precipitation behavior in the hydrogenated 0.12 wt.%H weld zone of Ti-0.3Mo-0.8Ni alloy argon-arc-welded joints have been investigated. The results showed that lamellar delta-hydride (face-centered cubic) could only precipitate from alpha-lamellae, but not from the transformed beta-phase due to the high hydrogen solubility in beta-phase. Formation of delta-hydride was the result of the alpha(H)-phase separation reaction: alpha(H) -> alpha (H-lean region) + delta (H-rich region). The formation mechanism of the relatively massive delta-hydride in the alpha(H) -matrix was mainly based on the combined effects of harsh stress field states and stringent hydrogen content requirements. A sharp drop in elongation and a slight increase in weld zone hardness of the hydrogenated welded joint were associated with delta-hydride precipitation.

AB The paper describes structure and properties of dissimilar stainless steels welded joints between duplex 2205 and austenitic 316L steels. Investigations were focused on environmentally assisted cracking of welded joints. The susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and hydrogen embrittlement was determined in slow strain rate tests (SSRT) with the strain rate of 2.2 x 10(-6) s(-1). Chloride-inducted SCC was determined in the 35% boiling water solution of MgCl2 environment at 125 degrees C. Hydrogen assisted SCC tests were performed in synthetic sea water under cathodic polarization condition. It was shown that place of the lowest resistance to chloride stress corrosion cracking is heat affected zone at duplex steel side of dissimilar joins. That phenomenon was connected with undesirable structure of HAZ comprising of large fractions of ferrite grains with acicular austenite phase. Hydrogen assisted SCC tests showed significant reduction in ductility of duplex 2205 steel while austenitic 316L steel remains almost immune to degradation processes. SSR tests of dissimilar welded joints revealed a fracture in the area of austenitic steel.

AB Multi-layered steel vessel (MLSV) for high-pressure hydrogen storage is an important equipment in hydrogen refueling station and periodic inspection is necessary to be carried out on it. Welded joint between the head and thick-walled nozzle of the vessel is the key point of the inspection. In this study, based on structural characteristics of MLSV, a method of inserted curved surface coupling phased array ultrasonic inspection (PAUI) was proposed. In order to achieve effective inspection on the welded joint, acoustic field calculation model of the welded joint by PAUI was established. Influences of various inspection parameters on the acoustic field were analyzed by considering difficulties of far detection distance, wide detection area and large material attenuation systematically to obtain optimized parameters and scanning method. Corresponding probe was subsequently made according to the analysis, and experiment was carried out on test block to prove effectiveness of the method in this study.

AB The Electric-Hydrogen Virtual Power Plant aggregates internal distributed energy resources to achieve joint electricity and hydrogen output, providing a new pathway for accommodating surplus renewable energy generation. However, precise modeling methods for the uncertain operating region of EH-VPP remain challenging. In this regard, this paper first defines the uncertain operating region of EH-VPP and constructs its internal optimization model. Then, based on multi-parameter programming theory and the cutting-plane method, the mapping relationship of the EH-VPP electricity-hydrogen joint output curve is analytically derived. Based on this, the probability density function of the projection points of the electricity-hydrogen joint curve onto the hydrogen production rate axis is derived, incorporating the known probability distributions of input random variables, thereby enabling probabilistic modeling of the uncertain operating region boundary. Finally, the opportunity constraint method is applied to construct the uncertain operating region of EH-VPP, which is then used in the coordinated scheduling optimization of the electric-hydrogen integrated energy system. Simulation results show that the proposed method efficiently characterizes the uncertain operating region with an error of less than 0.05 %, supports flexible modeling based on confidence levels, and ensures both scheduling security and computational efficiency in large-scale collaborative scheduling scenarios.

AB The hydrogen diffusion behaviors in welded joints of ultra-high strength steel (UHSS), which are related to hydrogen-induced cracks (HIC) in welding, are not yet fully understood due to the lack of in-situ observation techniques for hydrogen during welding. An improved microphotography technique is proposed to visualize the hydrogen distribution within the as-welded joint. When UHSS is welded using traditional welding materials, the transformation temperature from gamma to alpha phase (TF) of the weld metal (WM) is higher than that (TB) of the heataffected zone (HAZ), resulting in the observed hydrogen enrichment in the HAZ. We developed a low transformation temperature (LTT) welding material. This material is designed so that the TF of WM is lower than the TB of HAZ, facilitating hydrogen back-diffusion from the HAZ to the WM. This back-diffusion effectively reduces the hydrogen concentration in the HAZ. Additionally, a thermo-mechanical hydrogen diffusion sequentially coupled finite element procedure was utilized to simulate hydrogen concentration evolution during welding, revealing the control process of phase transformation temperature differences (Delta T = TF - TB) on hydrogen diffusion behavior and the influence of residual stress on the accumulation of hydrogen. The microphotography technique has successfully validated these findings, which can help to mitigate the risk of HIC in the HAZ during welding of UHSS.

AB The port-integrated energy system (PIES) presents a transformative pathway for decarbonizing port operations through multienergy synergies. Power-to-hydrogen technology converts surplus renewable energy into green hydrogen, which is stored and reconverted to electricity via fuel cells during supply shortages. However, joint optimization of heterogeneous ports, with divergent resource endowments and load profiles, remains challenging. This study proposes an optimal scheduling method for electricity-hydrogen-heat-integrated energy systems accounting for port-specific energy characteristics and establishes a multienergy coupling model of PIES with vessel-based mobile hydrogen storage and a cooperative optimization framework incorporating energy consumption dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that multiport joint dispatch reduces total operating costs by 2.3%-8.2%, compared to isolated schemes, while hydrogen-powered vessels enable spatiotemporal arbitrage and serve dual roles as mobile energy carriers/temporary storage units, with hydrogen interchange critically constrained by vessel logistics scheduling.

AB This work evaluates the AWS ER80S-G filler metal in buttery welding and F22 steel joint, in technical and economic replacement of ERNiCrMo-3 wire (Inconel 625). The metallurgical and mechanical characterization of buttery weld interfaces was performed using optical microscopy and scanning microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy and microhardness. The joints fracture toughness was estimated by crack tip opening displacement test and the fracture mechanism by SEM. To evaluate hydrogen embrittlement, samples were hydrogenated with a 0.1 M H2SO4 solution and tested by uniaxial tensile test. The microstructural results revealed that ER80S-G interface did not present any partially mixed zone (PMZ), differently the Inconel 625 interface. The PMZs presence in F22/Inconel 625 interface did not reduce the welded joint toughness. The hydrogen presence in the welded joints reduced the ductility and mechanical strength of F22 steel, in addition to changing the ductile fracture mode to brittle mode.

AB This article is devoted to the following issues: calculating the values of temperatures obtained by simulating welding heating and the subsequent implementation of the welding process at the given mode parameters made it possible to obtain a welded joint of the rotor with an improved initial structure and increased mechanical properties, hydrogen resistance and durability by up to 10-15%; simulating welding heating in the areas of fusion, the overheating and normalization of the HAZ and the formation of austenite grains; specified welding heating creates the conditions for the formation of new products of austenite decomposition in the form of sorbitol in the area of the incomplete recrystallization of the HAZ. In air and gaseous hydrogen, the destruction of the combined joints took place on the weld metal, as well as on the fusion areas, the overheating and the incomplete recrystallization of the HAZ of 20H3NMFA steel as the base metal. Structural materials have a relatively low strength and high fracture toughness in air. This is manifested in a significant reduction in the elongation (delta), the area (psi) and critical stress intensity factor (K-Ic) of welded joints and the endurance limit of cylindrical smooth rotor steel specimens, which were cut from transverse templates. Welded joints in the whole range of load amplitudes are sensitive to the action of hydrogen.

AB One of the major challenges for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) with therapeutic drugs is the short half-life of drugs in the joint cavity. The severity of OA often fluctuates with time and inflammatory factors. Here, we describe the use of a hydrogel material, named Gel-Man, to solve the problem of rapid release of drugs. Gel-Man could encapsulate a series of therapeutic drugs and be degraded by hydrogen peroxide. It could be decomposed, and release drugs controlled by the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the arthritic joint cavity. This hydrogel loaded with triamcinolone acetonide (TA) could slowly release the drug upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide in the joint cavity in patients suffering from osteoarthritis. The combination of TA and GEL-MAN hydrogels can slowdown the progression of degenerative change of osteoarthritis by maximizing the therapeutic efficacy and prolong the duration of drug treatment.

AB Effects of reducing environment and thermal aging on the joint strength of a BaO-B2O3-Al2O3-SiO2 glass-ceramic sealant (GC-9) with a ferritic-stainless-steel interconnect (Crofer 22 H) for planar solid oxide fuel cells are investigated. A technique is developed for conducting mechanical tests at room temperature and 800 degrees C in H-2-7 vol% H2O under shear and tensile loadings. Given an aged condition and loading mode, the joint strength at 800 degrees C is lower than that at room temperature in the given humidified hydrogen atmosphere. A thermal aging at 800 degrees C in H-2-7 vol% H2O for 100 h or 1000 h enhances both shear and tensile joint strengths at room temperature but degrades them at 800 degrees C in the same reducing environment Non-aged specimens show a comparable joint strength and fracture mode when tested in humidified hydrogen and in air under a given loading mode and testing temperature. The shear strength at 800 degrees C for joint specimens after a 1000-h thermal aging at 800 degrees C in air or humidified hydrogen is reduced by a similar extent of 19%, compared to the counterpart of non-aged joint specimens tested in the same oxidizing or reducing environment.

AB Neutron diffraction studies of hydrogen/deuterium-exchanged hen egg-white lysozyme were performed by a joint X-ray and neutron refinement to elucidate the hydrogen/deuterium exchange behavior. Large crystals for neutron work, consisting of molecules that were exchanged before crystallization, were obtained by repeatedly adding protein solution to the crystal batch using deuterated precipitant reagent. There are differences in hydrogen/deuterium exchange behavior compared with previous crystallographic or NMR studies, which could be due to intermolecular interactions in the crystal or to different lengths of exchange period.

AB Blending a fraction of hydrogen into the natural gas pipeline or urban pipe network is an efficient approach for hydrogen delivery. In this paper, the mathematical model of Hydrogen-Blended Natural Gas (HBNG) transportation is established, and the influences of hydrogen blending on hydraulic and thermal characteristics of natural gas pipeline and pipe network are numerically investigated. The impact of hydrogen blending ratio on the performance of centrifugal compressor and the operating point for joint operation of pipeline and compressor is discussed. Results illustrate that compared with natural gas without hydrogen, the hydrogen blending can reduce the pipeline friction resistance and increase the volume flow rate. However, due to the lower volumetric calorific value of HBNG, the energy flow rate actually decreases under the same transportation condition. Meanwhile, the temperature drop along the pipeline slows down due to the blended hydrogen. The performance degradation of centrifugal compressor occurs with the increasing hydrogen blending ratio, and the operating point for joint operation of pipeline and centrifugal compressor moves to the direction of higher volume flow rate and lower pressure. This study is expected to shed a light on the hydrogen delivery by natural gas pipelines and pipe networks.

AB The introduction of hydrogen into the UK natural gas main has been reviewed in terms of how materials within the gas distribution network may be affected by contact with up to 80% Natural Gas (NG)/20 mol% hydrogen blend at up to 2 barg. A range of metallic, polymeric and elastomeric materials in the gas distribution network (GDN) were assessed via a combination of literature review and targeted practical test programmes. The work considered: ? The effect of hydrogen on metallic materials identified in the network. ? The effect of hydrogen on polymeric materials identified in the network. ? The effect of hydrogen exposure on polyethylene pipeline joining and repair techniques (squeeze-off, and socket and saddle electrofusion joints) The experimental work involved soaking materials, under pressure conditions representative of the network, in 100% hydrogen, 20% hydrogen in methane, and 100% methane. For the metal samples, the test programme involved the assessment of hydrogen uptake on the tensile properties. For the polyethylene samples, the test programme looked at the assessment of possible hydrogen absorption/desorption and its effect on electrofusion jointing. The trials concluded that the majority of metallic materials showed no significant deterioration in mechanical (tensile) properties when stored in hydrogen environments compared to those stored in analogous methane or blended gas atmospheres up to 2 barg. Polymeric materials showed no deterioration to efficiency of squeeze-off or collar electrofusion in socket or shoulder orientations following soaking in hydrogen, methane or hydrogen blends. ? 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB The susceptibility of girth welds to sulphide stress cracking (SSC) and hydrogen embrittlement (HE) were evaluated for API grade X80 and X56 steels, both for similar (X80/X80) and dissimilar (X80/X56) joints. Slow strain rate (SSR) and hydrogen permeation tests were performed at room temperature using sodium thiosulphate solutions at different pH levels. The SSR tests showed that the majority of the welded joints studied, though approved by the API 1104 standard's criteria, did in fact suffer a reduction in ductility and showed indications of susceptibility to sulphide stress cracking and to hydrogen embrittlement in the form of secondary longitudinal and internal transverse cracks. This was true regardless the welding process used.

AB This work is aiming at investigation on Hydrogen impact on welded cold cracks in titanium weldments. The results indicated that when the hydrogen content in titanium alloy is below 300 ppm, the difficulty of delayed cracking in welded joints is relatively high. With the increase of hydrogen content, the tendency of delayed cracking increases, and the fracture mode changes from ductile fracture to brittle fracture, the amount of primary alpha phase in the alloy decreases and eventually disappears, while the amount of beta transition microstructure gradually increases with more acicular alpha ' phase and delta hydride. The delayed cracking at the weld toe position of the joint is related to high residual stress and the enrichment of hydrogen elements. The influence of hydrogen content on the delay of cold crack was analyzed, the mechanism of delayed cold crack generation was discussed. A model for the critical hydrogen content that causes welding cold cracks due to the coupling of welding stress and hydrogen was constructed, the coupling mechanism of welding stress and hydrogen content was clarified, and the influence of the two on the cold crack of titanium alloy welding was revealed.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Resistance of welded joint of X70 steel welded using Sv-08G1NMA and OK 10-74 flux wire against stress-corrosion cracking in near-neutral pH solution NS4 was investigated by the slow-strain rate method, voltammetry, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and electrolytic permeation of hydrogen method. It was established that the stress-corrosion cracking of welded joint occurs through the base metal in the range of potentials more positive than -0.92 V by the anodic dissolution mechanism, more negative than -1.05 V is consistent with a hydrogen embrittlement mechanism, and in the potentials' range from -0.92 V to -1.05 V, both by anodic dissolution and a hydrogen embrittlement mechanism. The susceptibility to stress-corrosion cracking coefficient KS increases with the polarization potential shift -0.75 V - -0.95 V - -1.05 V as follows: for the welded joint as 1.1 - 1.16 - 1.35, for X70 steel as 1.0 - 1.12 - 1.0.

AB The short-term stress corrosion cracking (SCC) behavior of X65 pipeline steel welded joints in simulated deep (1000 m) and shallow sea was studied by the immersion of U-shaped bend samples, electrochemistry, and scanning electron microscope observation of fracture surfaces. Results showed that a crack existed near the fusion line in deep sea, whereas no crack occurred in shallow sea. Tafel slope and corrosion potential of welded joint was low in deep sea environment indicting there excited hydrogen evolution reactions. Cathodic polarization was controlled by both oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions in deep sea, but only oxygen reduction reactions in shallow sea. The sensitivity of the SCC of the welded joint in deep sea was higher than that in shallow sea.

AB To identify the safety issues associated with hydrogen fueling stations, incidents at such stations in Japan and the USA were analyzed considering the regulations in these countries. Leakage due to the damage and fracture of main bodies of apparatuses and pipes in Japan and the USA is mainly caused by design error, that is, poorly planned fatigue. Considering the present incidents in these countries, adequate consideration of the usage environment in the design is very important. Leakage from flanges, valves, and seals in Japan is mainly caused by screw joints. If welded joints are to be used in hydrogen fueling stations in Japan, strength data for welded parts should be obtained and pipe thicknesses should be reduced. Leakage due to other factors, e.g., external impact, in Japan and the USA is mainly caused by human error. To realize self-serviced hydrogen fueling stations, safety measures should be developed to prevent human error by fuel cell vehicle users. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB Bonding at high temperatures can cause many problems, such as an induction of high stress, grain coarsening and strict requirements for bonding equipments, etc.. In this paper, a hydrogenation approach was utilized for the TC4 alloy before the dissimilar materials bonding process. Effects of hydrogen contents on the diffusion behavior of the TC4/GH3128 joints were investigated. Particularly, the mechanism that the hydrogenation affected the low-temperature bonding process of the TC4/GH3128 joints was discussed. By regulating the bonding temperatures, holding durations and hydrogen contents, a maximum of 92 MPa was achieved. The formation mechanism of the diffusion bonded TC4/GH3128 joint was proposed. This novel metal hydrogenation idea can offer new insights on the development of the low-temperature joining particularly suitable for dissimilar materials joining.

AB Sulfide stress cracking resistance of welded high strength low alloy (HSLA) steel for high pressure vessel (called "WDL690D" steel) was evaluated in NACE "A" solution at room temperature. Though the failure time increased with the decreasing applied stress for either WDL690D base steel or its welded joint, the welded joint presented the lower threshold stress of about 53% YS compared with the base steel of about 65% YS, because of its inhomogeneous microstructure distribution. The hydrogen trapping efficiency of the WDL6900 base steel and its welded joint was also investigated by measuring the permeability 1,0I. and the apparent diffusivity (Dapp). The results showed that the welded joint had lower trapping efficiency, but was more susceptible to SSC. In addition, the fractography of both the WDL690D base steel and its welded joint all exhibited a mixed ductile-brittle rupture when exposed in H2S environment under constant loading stress.

AB Hydrogenation can adjust the microstructure state of Ti-6Al-4V laser weld joint, and improve the superplastic deformation uniformity. The study on superplastic deformation behavior of hydrogenated Ti-6Al-4V laser weld joint is the basis of the improvement of the superplastic deformation uniformity. Therefore, the present paper investigated the effect of the set hydrogen amount on the peak flow stress, welded plate elongation and microstructure uniformity. The results reveal that the peak flow stress increases with the rising hydrogen content, decreases with the higher deformation temperature, and increases with the increasing of strain rate. The elongation declines when the hydrogen content increases, improves when the deformation temperature rises, and decreases when the strain rate increases. The minimum peak flow stress is 20.7 MPa, and the maximum elongation reaches 312% when the hydrogen content is 0.291%, the deformation temperature 920 degrees C and the strain rate 10(-4) s(-1).

AB Schedulable hydropower and hydrogen power provide essential flexibility to mitigate variability of renewables such as wind and photovoltaic power. Previous research has focused on the flexibility of power systems utilizing a single adjustable source (e.g., hydropower). However, joint flexibility of combining adjustable hydropower and hydrogen power has rarely been explored simultaneously. This study aims to establish a joint flexible operation framework for hydro-hydrogen-wind-photovoltaic hybrid power systems. Initially, the forecast uncertainties are quantified regarding the inflow as well as the combined wind and photovoltaic power. Subsequently, a triobjective optimization model is formulated to maximize operation benefits while enhancing joint flexibility in managing water levels and allocating power to hydrogen production, deriving the flexible operation space. Finally, the operation space's effectiveness is validated by stochastic simulation. Results from a case study using China's Ertan hydro-hydrogen-wind-photovoltaic hybrid power system indicated that the minimum operation benefit derived from the decisions within the operation space decreased with increasing flexibilities of both the water level and power allocation to hydrogen production. The benefit loss (i.e., the gap between the theoretical maximum and actual benefits) decreased by 26.53 %, from 3.77 to 2.77 million CNY, through maintaining operation decisions within the flexible space during a hypothetical earthquake emergency. This was achieved by adjusting 1.79 % release and 10.71 % hydrogen production power. The proposed method provides implications of jointly utilizing flexibilities of adjustable power sources to decrease economic loss. This research contributes to reducing energy emissions by improving energy use efficiency of power systems.

AB P91 steel weld joint was prepared using the shielded metal arc welding process and four different conditions of weld consumable that provide the different levels of diffusible hydrogen in deposited metal. In the present research, the effects of diffusible hydrogen content on the flexural strength, lower critical stress, and tensile strength of P91 steel welds were also determined with respect to different electrode conditions. To investigate the effect of diffusible hydrogen on multipass welding, top and root side flexural tests were performed. The residual stresses (axial stress and transverse stress) were also measured using the blind hole drilling method for different conditions of welding consumable. The peak value of residual stresses was measured at the center of the weld fusion zone. The maximum value of transverse stress was measured to be 355 MPa for case II (6.21 mL/100 g of diffusible hydrogen), while the maximum axial stress was about 218 MPa for case IV (12.43 mL/100 g of diffusible hydrogen). A three-dimensional finite element simulation was also performed to predict the residual stress distribution and thermal profile along the welded joint. The experimentally determined residual stresses correlated well with the numerically estimated residual stresses. The diffusible hydrogen content was not observed to have any significant effect on the residual stresses. The corrected residual stress values were also predicted by considering the plasticity-induced error. However, the flexural performance of the welded joint was affected by the diffusible hydrogen content. The top and root flexural strength was measured to be optimum for the low level of diffusible hydrogen content, and the values decreased with an increase in diffusible hydrogen content.

AB In this work, AlSi10MgMn die cast aluminum alloy and 6061 aluminum alloys were bonded using Metal inert gas (MIG) welding assisted by ultrasonic frequency pulse (UFP). The effect of UFP on the weld shape, joint porosity, microstructure and mechanical properties of the joints was investigated. Results revealed a distinct decrease in joint hydrogen porosity defects and pore size via the UFP-MIG welding approach in comparison to a directly bonded joint. This method resulted in the tensile strength of the joint reaching 185% of the joint bonded without UFP. The regulating mechanism of UFP on the joint porosity was determined.

AB Fatigue crack growth behavior of the hydrogenated Ti-0.3Mo-0.8Ni alloy gas tungsten arc welded (GTAW) joints was investigated. Fracture model of hydrogen-induced GTAW joint was revealed in details. The results show that as hydrogen level increased, crack growth rate in Paris and instability growth zones increased, the more the hydride, the more crack growth channels, the faster crack growth rate, and brittle fracture was intensified. There was the mutation of dislocation density on both sides of the hydride, and dislocation tangles and dislocation lines were concentrated in the vicinity of the hydride. Dislocation weakening caused by solute hydrogen and internal stress generated by hydrogen-rich clusters respectively promoted crack initiation. Evolution of hydride morphology and distribution caused by the interaction between the hydride and persistent slip bands (PSB) significantly reduced crack initiation resistance. Hydride inside the PSB as a hardening phase accelerated to separate from the matrix or itself fracture, which further promoted crack initiation. Cracks in Paris zone rapidly propagated along grain boundary of coarse size "cluster", alpha / beta phase boundary and the hydride, or cut through alternating lamellar alpha and fine needle beta grains and the hydride.

AB Large-scale green hydrogen production system combining wind farms and electrolysis systems is an important way to low-carbon energy system. The flexible and fast ramping capability of the electrolysis system provides the possibility for a wind-electrolysis joint system (WEJS) to provide secondary frequency regulation (SFR) to reduce the production cost of green hydrogen. To increase the biddable capacity and improve the full load hours, this paper proposes a cooperative power allocation strategy for wind turbines and electrolyzers responding to the down and up AGC signals respectively. Furthermore, this paper proposes a more accurate method for estimating the daily hydrogen production due to response to the up ramping of automatic generation control (AGC) signals to ensure that the joint system meets the hydrogen production contract when providing SFR. Based on the above two points, this paper proposes a multi-timescale control framework and robust bidding optimization for a WEJS participating in energy and regulation markets. Case studies demonstrate that the relative error of daily hydrogen production can be controlled at 3.37%. The full load hours of the electrolysis systems can be increased by 50.21% compared with only participation in the energy market.

AB Hydrogen storage cylinder is an important component in high-pressure gaseous hydrogen (HPGH2) storage system, and plays a key role in hydrogen-powered transportation including land vehicles, ships and aircrafts. Over the past decade, the number of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) has rapidly increased worldwide. In order to promote the application of hydrogen storage cylinder, guide its design, manufacture, inspection and testing, a series of regulations, codes and standards have been issued. The Chinese national standard, GB/T 42612, for type IV hydrogen storage cylinders has also been issued. This paper first gives a brief overview to these regulations, codes and standards. Furthermore, the specifications including scope, category, filling cycles, service life, materials, design, manufacture, qualification tests and periodic inspections are analyzed and compared. Issues about evaluation method for hydrogen compatibility of non-metallic materials, welded joints of plastic liner, joint between boss and liner are also discussed. Notably, the performance requirements in GB/T 42612 are generally in accordance with the international ones, but the requirements of materials, design and manufacture are more detailed.

AB As an emerging energy carrier, hydrogen presents a potential opportunity to increase the flexibility and resiliency of the integrated power and transportation system having ultrahigh penetration of renewable generation. This article studies a conceptual integrated energy-mobility system (IEMS) based on renewable-to-hydrogen stations (RHSs) and tank truck fleets. In an RHS, the renewables power the grid while also charge a hydrogen energy storage unit that can perform power-to-hydrogen (P2H) and hydrogen-to-power (H2P) operations. Besides, using tank truck fleets, the RHS will distribute its surplus hydrogen products to local consumers, e.g., refueling stations serving hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The operation framework of the IEMS is analyzed. And some preprocessing technologies are developed to reduce modeling complexity. Then, a joint optimal scheduling model, involving renewable generationcontract, P2H, and H2P of the RHS, hydrogen product demands of the local consumers, and vehicle routing problem (VRP) of the truck fleets, is established. Afterwards, the formulated problem is solved by a heuristic method based on the exhaustive search and genetic algorithm. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the joint optimal scheduling model and illustrate that the IEMS has the potentials to promote hydrogen-integrated transportation and power systems.

AB Hydrogen produced by water decomposition caused high diffusible hydrogen content in deposited metal, but also produced numerous spatter and unstable fragments which were considered as the main reason that deteriorated the weld formation during underwater wet flux cored welding (FCAW). Drawn inspiration from onshore gas shielded welding, in this paper, a liquid shielded welding method was invented. As a by-product of biodiesel, glycerol was chosen as liquid protectant. The results suggested that the diffusible hydrogen content in deposited metal was reduced by 62.4% with glycerol shielded due to its higher decomposition threshold and less hydrogen in decomposition products. Arc bubbles were attached to the molten pool surface and their expansion rate and rising velocity were slowed down resulted in more stable droplet transfer process and less spatter owing to high viscosity glycerol protectant. Almost porosity-free joints were obtained and the mechanical properties of the welded joints were also improved. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Commonly available hydrophobic substances used in industrial applications were selected for the research. The aim of using waterproof coatings was to check the possibility to decreasing the susceptibility of high-strength low-alloy S460N steel to cold cracking. During experiments diffusible hydrogen content in deposited metal determination by mercury method, metallographic macro- and microscopic testing and hardness measurements were performed. Investigations showed that waterproof coatings laid on covered electrodes can improve the quality of wet welded joints, by decreasing the Vickers HV10 hardness in heat-affected zone and decreasing the diffusible hydrogen content in deposited metal, which minimalize possibility of cold cracking.

AB In this paper Small Punch Tests (SPT) are used to determine the mechanical properties of the heat affected zone (HAZ) of CrMoV welded joints and to evaluate the embrittlement caused by the presence of internal hydrogen. Hydrogen permeation tests were carried out to determine the effective diffusion coefficients of the different regions of welded joints, whose hydrogen contents were measured using a hydrogen analyser.
   The paper demonstrates that SPTs can be used to estimate the tensile properties and the toughness of small areas, such as the subzones of a welded joint which are not thick enough for machining standard specimens. In cases where it is not possible to determine the fracture toughness of brittle regions using standard SPT samples, tests using longitudinally notched SPT samples were conducted. The normalized energy at failure, W/t(2), was selected as the most appropriate SPT parameter to estimate the fracture toughness regardless of the fracture behaviour of the material (ductile or brittle). It was seen that the fracture toughness of the fine grained HAZ (FG-HAZ) is similar to that of the Base Metal (BM), while the fracture toughness of the coarse grained HAZ (CG-HAZ) is more similar to that of the Weld Metal (WM). The effect of hydrogen on BM and FG-HAZ is low, with embrittlement indexes of about 20%. However, a strong effect of hydrogen was observed in CG-HAZs and WMs, with embrittlement indexes of 60-80%. and a clear change from ductile to brittle behaviour in their fracture surfaces.

AB Background Hydrogen peroxide has been widely used in Orthopaedics including Orthopaedic oncology, trauma and joint surgeries. However, we encountered an oxygen embolism and myoglobinuria after hydrogen peroxide was used to irrigate a septic hip arthroscopically. Case presentation A 61-year-old male patient with right hip septic arthritis underwent an arthroscopic hip washout and debridement. During the operation, the surgeon used 100 ml of 3% hydrogen peroxide to irrigate the joint cavity. Two minutes after irrigation, there was a transient decrease in oxygen saturation, heart rate and blood pressure, with significant subcutaneous emphysema around the wound. Concentrated urine was drained out 8 h after operation which resolved the following day. Post-operatively, the patient was managed in the intensive care unit for a pulmonary embolism and discharged without further complications. Conclusion Medical staff should be aware of the risk of oxygen embolism and be extremely careful when using hydrogen peroxide in patient care. Oxygen embolism following hydrogen peroxide use is rare, however, once encountered, it may bring serious consequences. Therefore, the use of hydrogen peroxide in closed spaces or arthroscopic procedures should be discontinued.

AB X80 steel plays a pivotal role in the development of oil and gas pipelines; however, its welded joints, particularly the heat-affected zone (HAZ), are susceptible to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) due to their complex microstructures. This study investigates the SCC initiation mechanisms of X80 steel welded joints under practical pipeline conditions with varying levels of cathodic protection. The SCC behaviors were analyzed through electrochemical measurements, hydrogen permeation tests, and interrupted slow strain rate tensile tests (SSRTs) conducted in a near-neutral pH environment under different potential conditions (OCP, -1.1 VSCE, -1.2 VSCE). These behaviors were influenced by microstructure type, grain size, martensite/austenite (M/A) constituents, and dislocation density. The sub-zones of the weld exhibited differing SCC resistance, with the fine-grain (FG) HAZ, base metal (zone), welded metal (WM) zone, and coarse-grain (CG) HAZ in descending order. In particular, the presence of coarse grains, low dislocation density, and extensive M/A islands collectively increased corrosion susceptibility and SCC sensitivity in the CGHAZ compared to other sub-zones. The SCC initiation mechanisms of the sub-zones within the X80-steel welded joint were primarily anodic dissolution (AD) under open-circuit potential (OCP) condition, shifting to either hydrogen-enhanced local plasticity (HELP) or hydrogen embrittlement (HE) mechanisms at -1.1 VSCE or -1.2 VSCE, respectively.

AB Local hydrogen enrichment would increase the risk of hydrogen embrittlement in welded structures, so the dynamic hydrogen diffusion process and final concentration distribution were investigated numerically by finite element simulation for a hydrogen gas transport X80 steel spiral welded pipe. The results show that the change of microstructure induced by weld thermal cycle would decrease the hydrogen concentration in welded joint, but welding residual stress could cause local hydrogen enrichment. Equivalent hydrogen pressures for base metal, weld metal and three subregions in heat-affected zone were put forward in order to scientifically evaluate the influence of hydrogen enrichment on hydrogen embrittlement.

AB Hydrogenation of niobium foil was achieved by cathodic charging and its application as the interlayer facilitates a sound joint of TiA/Ti2AlNb. The microstructure and mechanical properties of hydrogenated niobium were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), nano-indentation and thermogravimetry (TG) analysis. It is demonstrated that the plasticity of the surface of niobium interlayer is improved and dislocation density in niobium crystal lattice increases significantly, owing to the process of niobium interlayer hydrogenation and subsequent dehydrogenation. To investigate the effect of the hydrogenation of the niobium interlayer on the TiAl/Ti2AlNb diffusion bonding joint, the pure niobium foil was also applied as the interlayer for comparison. The effect of the bonding parameters on the interfacial microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of the joints were systematically analyzed by SEM coupled with an energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and shear test. The typical microstructure of the joint is found to be TiAl/B2 phase/Nb/delta phase/beta phase/Ti2AlNb. With the increase of the hydrogen content, bonding temperature, holding time and bonding pressure, the bonding defects decreased and the thickness of the diffusion layer increased correspondingly. The shear strength of joint reached 258.9 MPa at 950 degrees C for 40 min under a pressure of 5 MPa with the hydrogenated niobium interlayer of 1.0 wt% hydrogen content.

AB Friction stir welding (FSW) has emerged as a solid-state joining technique offering notable advantages over traditional welding methods. Gas metal arc welding (GMAW), a fusion-based process, remains widely used due to its high efficiency, productivity, weld quality, and ease of automation. To combine the benefits of both techniques, a hybrid welding approach integrating GMAW and FSW has been developed. This study investigates the impact of this hybrid technique on the joint quality and properties of AA5083-H111 and AA6082-T6 aluminum alloys. Butt joints were produced on 6 mm thick plates, with variations in friction process parameters. Characterization included macro- and microstructural analyses, mechanical testing (hardness and tensile strength), and corrosion resistance evaluation through stress corrosion cracking tests. Results showed that FSW significantly refined and homogenized the microstructure in both alloys. AA5083-H111 welds achieved a joint efficiency of 99%, while AA6082-T6 reached 66.7%, differences attributed to their distinct strengthening mechanisms and the thermal-mechanical effects of FSW. To assess hydrogen-related behavior, slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) tests were conducted in both inert and hydrogen-rich environments. Hydrogen content was measured in arc, friction, and overlap zones, revealing variations depending on the alloy and microstructure. Despite these differences, both alloys exhibited negligible hydrogen embrittlement. In conclusion, the GMAW-FSW hybrid process successfully produced sound joints with good mechanical and corrosion resistance performance in both aluminum alloys. The findings demonstrate the potential of hybrid welding as a viable method for enhancing weld quality and performance in applications involving dissimilar aluminum alloys.

AB The expansion of the gas pipeline network makes it necessary, on the one hand, to meet the requirements of standards regarding the materials used, but on the other hand, it is necessary to weld them. In the case of natural gas as a fuel, the welding process is widely used, but in the case of replacing natural gas with a mixture of this gas and hydrogen, the requirements regarding the quality of the process must be significantly increased or the process must be completely changed. This article presents the results of testing welded joints for a newly developed welding technology for the transmission of a hydrogen mixture. Material tests were carried out on a butt-circumferential-welded joint made between two spiral pipes with an outer diameter of 711 mm and wall thickness of 11 mm in the X70 grade. The developed welding technology is distinguished by a change in the beveling method of the edges, which allows the heat input to the material to be limited. The technology was developed for use in natural on-shore and off-shore gas pipelines with the addition of hydrogen. As a result, additional requirements in terms of joint plasticity had to be met during welding. The test results obtained indicate that the joints are characterized by high strength (more than 581 MPa), higher than that of the base material (fracture in the base material) and good impact strength at reduced temperature (more than 129 J). In transverse corrosion, a hardness below 250 HV and a favorable structure of ferrite with different morphologies were obtained.

AB High-efficiency and energy-saving comprehensive energy systems can provide both economic and environmental benefits. These are crucial for promoting the economy of distribution-network systems. A distributionally robust optimization model is proposed to jointly operate integrated energy systems with wind, hydrogen, cogeneration, combined heat and power (CHP), and other agents, which considers joint demand response and energy sharing across agents. A profit distribution mechanism based on an improved Shapley value is proposed for equally redistributing excessive income. The simulation results show that: (1) the combined wind hydrogen cogeneration-generation (IDR) system reduces hydrogen energy extraction expenses and improves renewable energy utilization efficiency; (2) in line with distributionally robust optimization theory, the optimization model of a wind hydrogen cogeneration direct-drive integrated system for maximizing joint income solves uncertain renewable energy outputs, such as wind energy and photovoltaics, improving the overall benefit of wind hydrogen combined heat and power generation systems; and (3) the improved Shapley value approach solves the income distribution problem for relevant stakeholders, and a reasonable distribution of additional income increases the enthusiasm of all participants.

AB This study examines the influence of arc pulsation and ErNiCrMo-3 filler metal on stress corrosion cracking (SCC) in P91 steel weld joints using activated tungsten inert gas (A-TIG) welding. The constant current joint without filler showed the lowest resistance to SCC, while the pulsed current joint with filler exhibited the highest SCC resistance. Arc pulsation reduced chromium carbide precipitates, enhancing microstructural refinement and crack growth thereby increasing tensile strength and SCC resistance. Filler introduced minor austenitic phases inside martensitic microstructure with reduced hydrogen content contributed to increased SCC resistance. The joint fractography among all welds revealed a complete transgranular fracture.

AB The sulphide stress cracking (SSC) behaviour of the dissimilar metal welded joint of X60 pipeline steel and Inconel 625 alloy in H2S environment was investigated using constant load testing, weight loss.testing and finite element analysis. The dissimilar welded joint shows high SSC susceptibility, and the asymmetric stress concentration after corrosion is the prerequisite for crack initiation. Anodic dissolution prevents crack blunting, whereas hydrogen embrittlement increases the crack propagation rate and affects SSC to propagate along the fusion boundary. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study looks at the confinement effects of Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux and magnetic fields, as well as topological defects in a quantum plasma, on the hydrogen atom. The joint effects show that the system is extremely attractive. Furthermore, as we have shown, the joint effect of the fields is greater than the sum of the individual effects, resulting in a significant change in the system's bound state energy. The magnetic field can be used as a control parameter or booster, whereas the topological defect and the AB field are needed to hold the hydrogen atom in quantum plasmas at a low energy. The findings of our research may be extended to atomic structure and plasma collisions.

AB It is rather difficult for Ti alloy welds to be superplastic formed due to their low superplasticity and high flow stress. In this study, the Ti-6Al-4V alloy after hydrogenation with 0.2 wt% hydrogen was subjected to friction stir welding (FSW). The superplastic behavior of the FSW joint was investigated. The stir zone with a fine lamellar microstructure exhibited a largest elongation of 660% at 825 degrees C and 3 x 10(-3) s(-1). Besides, the stir zone showed a similar superplasticity of close to 600% to the base material at 825 degrees C, 3 x 10(-4) -1 x 10(-3) s(-1). It is the first report on the superplasticity of FSW Ti alloy joints with hydrogenation. Compared to the FSW Ti-6Al-4V alloy joint without hydrogenation, the hydrogenated FSW joint showed superior superplastic properties, including a high elongation, less than a half flow stress and lower superplastic temperature. These superior superplastic properties were mainly attributed to the globularization of the lamellar microstructure and the high fraction of beta phase induced by the hydrogen element. This study provides an effective way to reduce the difficulty of practical superplastic forming for Ti alloy welds, although a dehydrogenation process is still needed to avoid hydrogen embrittlement.

AB In this paper, the mechanical properties of various zones of the welded joints of a heat-resistant steel 15Kh1M1F in different states (in the initial state, after an operation on the main steam piping of a thermal power plant (TPP) for 23 years) were determined, and the fracture surfaces were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. The effect of hydrogen electrolytic charging on mechanical behavior and fracture mechanism was also studied. The long-term operation of welds resulted in a higher degradation degree of the weld metal compared to the base one, indicated by the deterioration of mechanical properties: decrease in hardness, strength characteristics, and reduction in area, which was accompanied by an atypical increase in elongation at fracture. All studied zones of the operated welded joints were characterized by higher hydrogen content, 2.5-3 times higher than that in the initial state. Additional hydrogen charging of the weld joint metal led to a decrease in the strength and ductility characteristics, more significantly for the operated weld compared with the non-operated one. This justified the possibility of using short-term tests of hydrogenated WM in the air to assess the degree of its damage during operation on a steam piping.

In recent years, the developments of low hydrogen ferritic steel (LHF) consumables that contain no hygroscopic compounds are utilized for welding Q&T steels. Heat affected zone (HAZ) softening is another critical issue during welding of armour grade Q&T steels and it depends on the welding process employed and the weld thermal cycle. In this investigation an attempt has been made to study the influence of welding consumables and welding processes on metallurgical characteristics of armour grade Q&T steel joints by various metallurgical characterization procedures. Shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) and flux cored arc welding (FCAW) processes were used for making welds using ASS, LHF and HNS welding consumables. The joints fabricated by using LHF consumables offered lower degree of HAZ softening and there is no evidence of HIC in the joints fabricated using LHF consumables.

AB A computer simulation study of a system containing 33666 SPC/E water molecules at the atmospheric pressure and room temperature is carried out. A thermodynamically motivated geometric criterion of the hydrogen bond is developed based on statistical regularities of joint distributions of oxygen-oxygen, oxygen-hydrogen distances, and the interaction energies of molecular pairs corresponding to these distances. Using this criterion makes it possible to substantially increase the selectivity of the algorithms for identifying hydrogen bonds during computer simulation.

AB Hydrogen-powered vehicles have recently attracted significant attention from both the private sector and the governmental organizations as an alternative to the conventional fossil-fueled vehicles. In addition, the liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) technology now offers a promising solution for the reliable and safe storage of hydrogen. The proliferation of hydrogen-based vehicles depends heavily on the economic viability of the LOHC-based hydrogen generation and storage plants. This paper demonstrates how such plants should be sized and operated for joint applications, in order to enhance the system rate of return. To that end, a new model is proposed for optimal sizing and scheduling of the LOHC-based generation and storage plants for concurrent services to both the transportation sector and ancillary services market. The ancillary service signals are incorporated into the optimal scheduling model, in order to prepare the LOHC-based plant for the successful contribution to the market. The efficacy of the model is numerically evaluated using historical operating data, and the results are discussed. It is demonstrated that the proposed model can alleviate the gap between the present and the expected rate of return of the LOHC-based plants via joint scheduling for multiple services.

AB To analyze the causes and mechanisms affecting the fracture toughness of X80 pipeline steel welded joints against H2S, the fracture toughness of different zones of X80 pipeline steel welded joints in both air and saturated H2S solution was investigated. The fracture toughness of welded joints degraded significantly in the saturated H2S solution, where the crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) characteristic value in the coarse grain heat-affected zone (CGHAZ) and weld metal (WM) was only 8% and 12% of that in air, respectively. However, the sub-critical grain heat-affected zone (SCHAZ) showed better resistance to H2S corrosion, with the CTOD characteristic value reaching 42% of that in air. The resistance of the welded joint to H2S corrosion was sensitive to microstructures. The grain boundary ferrite (GBF) presented in WM, and the angle of grain boundary orientation in CGHAZ was not conducive to hindering crack propagation. Moreover, the formation of the resultant hydrogen cracks owing to the H2S corrosion also reduced the fracture toughness of the welded joint.

AB Using basic-type flux cored wires significantly improve the toughness of weld joints, but the addition of fluoride decreases the weld-ability of the metal. In this paper, the flux cored tungsten inert gas (FCTIG) process was used to weld DH36 steel with a basic-type flux cored wire and a rutile-type flux cored wire. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the wires were investigated as well as the diffusible hydrogen content in the different weld joints. The results indicated that the FCTIG process using a basic-type flux cored wire has more technological advantages and produces lower amounts of fume during welding compared with flux cored arc welding (FCAW). The presence of large amounts of alloying elements in the rutile-type flux cored wire promoted the formation of acicular ferrite (AF) in the weld bead, which enhanced the micro-hardness and strength of the bead. The generation of fluoride with the basic-type flux cored wire reduced the diffusible hydrogen content (DHC) in the weld joint, with the lowest DHC value being 3.18 mL/100 g. The toughness of the weld joint made with the basic-type flux cored wire was improved, and the highest impact energy measured was 264.8 J.

AB Hydrogen provides a pathway to the clean transition of the future energy mix, rendering hydrogen energy service providers (HESPs) an important role in hydrogen supply. Additionally, collaborative operation through vehicle based hydrogen transportation exhibits great potential for mitigating source-load fluctuations of HESPs. However, current collaborations on hydrogen transportation primarily focus on route selection while neglecting delay risks, which may precipitate abrupt energy deficits during the scheduling of energy receivers. This work proposes a multi-HESP cooperative game that considers a deadline assignment mechanism to ensure the robustness hydrogen delivery while fully unlocking the scheduling flexibility supported by the road network. Considering the transportation-time uncertainty, the distributionally robust joint chance constraint (DRJCC) is introduced model delay uncertainties effectively and improve hydrogen delivery reliability. A customized approximation method is proposed to reformulate the DRJCC model into a tractable approximation with low conservatism while enhancing flexibility in decision-making under transportation delay uncertainty. Case studies verify that proposed framework can improve the flexibility and enthusiasm of multi-HESP cooperation under the electricity-hydrogen transmission network.

AB The weldability of steel under the water is limited due to the influence of the environment. Water causes limited visibility, presence of the residual stresses, increasing the cooling rate, and increasing the diffusible hydrogen content in deposited metal, leading to the formation of brittle microstructures in heat-affected zone (HAZ). The paper presents the results of mechanical properties testing of S420G2+M steel welded joints made with covered electrodes in the water with salinity values: 0 & PTSTHOUSND;, 7.5 & PTSTHOUSND;, and 35 & PTSTHOUSND;. The non-destructive tests: ultrasonic (UT) and radiographic (RT), and destructive tests: Vickers HV10 measurements, Charpy impact, and bending and metallographic macro- and microscopic tests were performed. Moreover, the diffusible hydrogen content in deposited metal by the mercury method was measured. It was observed that water salinity has an influence on the stability of the welding arc and the properties of joints. In particular, it was found that increasing the water salinity provides to: decreasing the hardness of HAZ (from 211 HV10 to 193 HV10), increasing the impact strength (from 82.5 to 101.3 J/cm(2)). Additionally, a slight increase in the diffusible hydrogen content in deposited metal (up to 65 ml/100g) was observed. The number of microcracks in the joints decreased with increasing the water salinity.

AB Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) of high-grade pipeline welded joint is a threat to hydrogen gas transport. In this research, slow strain rate tension (SSRT) tests in high-pressure hydrogen gas, combined with hydrogen permeation tests and microstructure analysis were conducted on X80 steel, intercritical heated-affected zone (ICHAZ), fine-grained heat affected zone (FGHAZ) and coarse-grained heat-affected zone (CGHAZ). The change of HE susceptibility from high to low was CGHAZ, FGHAZ, ICHAZ, and base metal. Microstructure was the important factor influencing hydrogen permeation and susceptibility to HE. Susceptibility to HE was increased in the order of "fine-grained massive ferrite (ME) and acicular ferrite (AF)", "fine-grained granular bainite (GB) and MF", "coarse-grained GB and bainite ferrite (BF) embedded with martensite-austenite (M-A) constitute". The fine-grained MF and AF in base metal with lower hydrogen diffusivity can impede the embrittlement behaviour, while the coarse-grained GB and BF with higher hydrogen diffusivity in CGHAZ increased its susceptibility to HE.

AB In the present study, the dissimilar welded joints of AA6082/A360 aluminum alloy were prepared by cold metal transfer (CMT) mode, cold metal transfer with pulse (CMT + Pulse) mode, and pulse (Pulse) mode. The influence of the metal transfer modes on the porosity distribution, microstructure, and mechanical properties of dissimilar welded joints were analyzed. The results show that the formation and distribution of weld pores are mainly determined by the hydrogen content of the base metals, cooling rate of the molten pool, driving force, and escaping distance of bubbles. For all the prepared dissimilar welded joints, the regions with the highest porosity appear at the A360 side fusion lines due to the higher hydrogen content of the casting A360 aluminum alloy, followed by the AA6082 side fusion lines and the central regions. With the application of Pulse mode in the welding process, the driving force of bubbles increases and the escape time shortens. The escape time of a bubble was reduced from 4.0 to 3.0 ms compared to CMT welding mode. Therefore, the average porosity of the joints decreases significantly, and the tensile stress increases accordingly. The microstructure of the weld zone gradually changed from long strip grains to equiaxed grains. The tensile stress of the dissimilar welded joint prepared by Pulse mode is 59.2% higher than that of the CMT welded joint.

AB Reliable low-temperature bonding of Zr-4 alloy is crucial for the safe run of nuclear reactors because the high temperature damages the performance of Zr-4 alloy. The hydrogenated Zr-4 alloy containing 0.2 wt % hydrogen was formed by gaseous hydrogen charging at 700 degrees C for 2 h and was subsequently used to facilitate the diffusion bonding of Zr-4 alloy. The effect of hydrogen and bonding temperature (600-700 degrees C) on the microstructure and phase composition were investigated by electro channeling images (ECCI) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The repeatable results indicated that, dif-fusion bonding of Zr-4 alloy was successfully realized at low temperature of 650 degrees C for 60 min under a pressure of 15 MPa. The bonding temperature was about 150 degrees C lower than the bonding temperature (800 degrees C) required in bonding of Zr-4 alloy without hydrogen charging treatment. The joint had highest room temperature shear strength was when bonding at 700 degrees C, which increased by 367% relative to the shear strength (55 +/- 7 MPa) of the joint welded without hydrogen charging treatment at same temperature.

AB This study provides a comprehensive review of research on the optimization of location and capacity planning for hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs) serving hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs). First, we outline HRS components and processes to establish a technical foundation. Then it examines key factors influencing HRS planning and highlights the integration of technical considerations with strategic decisions. We further discuss the singleobjective and multi-objective optimization models, and emphasize their respective application scenarios. The findings suggest that joint optimization of location and capacity can reduce total costs by up to 10-15 %, increase the demand coverage rate to over 90 % and improve the efficiency of urban hydrogen transportation networks, thereby significantly enhancing the efficiency of urban hydrogen transportation networks. Finally, the review identifies future research directions, including the integration of advanced technologies and policy coordination. Overall, this work offers theoretical insights and practical guidance for HRS planning, supporting the broader development of hydrogen energy infrastructure and contributing to the transition toward sustainable transportation systems.

AB This study investigates the effect of thermal exposure (i.e., 80 degrees C for 14 days) on the static and fatigue characteristics of adhesive-bonded aluminum joints. Results showed that thermal exposure reduced the quasi-static strength of the adhesive-bonded joints by up to similar to 16%. The thermal exposure slightly decreased the fatigue resistance of the adhesive-bonded aluminum joints at high cycle regime (>similar to 10(6) cycles) but significantly degraded the fatigue resistance at low cycle regime (similar to 10(3) - 10(4) cycles). The effects of thermal exposure on the properties of adhesive and interfacial bond adhesion between the adhesive and aluminum were analyzed. It was found that the thermal exposure degraded the properties of adhesive due to that adhesive was oxidized, which led to the decreases of the static strength and fatigue resistance at low cycle regime for the adhesive-bonded aluminum joints. The oxidation of adhesive decreased the content of O-H group in the adhesive, which likely reduced the hydrogen bond at the adhesive/aluminum interface. The decrease in the content of hydrogen bond weakened the bond adhesion at the adhesive/aluminum interface, and consequently slightly reduced the fatigue resistance at high cycle regime for the adhesive-bonded aluminum joints.

AB In this work, the environmental fracture behavior of marine steel and its welding joint were compared in artificial seawater. The electrochemical measurement, slow strain rate tensile test, and low-frequency cyclic loading test were conducted. The results showed that the corrosion current density and stress corrosion cracking susceptibility of welding joints were higher than those of base metal, caused by high dislocation density and residual stress in the heat-affected zone. The acidification and ion concentration occurred at the crack tip of the welding joint and basic metal. pH value and Cl-- concentration at the crack tip reached 4.1 and 3.8 mol/L, respectively. The crack growth rate of the welding joint was higher than that of base metal. The crack growth behavior was controlled by the mechano-electrochemical effect at the crack tip, and hydrogen embrittlement was the main factor.

AB The development of low-Mo austenitic stainless steels for high-pressure hydrogen valves and joints was undertaken to contribute to resource saving. Low-strain-rate tensile tests were carried out at 233 K in 70 MPa high-pressure gaseous hydrogen. The fracture surfaces of specimens tested in high-pressure gaseous hydrogen were observed by scanning electron microscopy. The effect of hydrogen charging on room-temperature creep deformation was studied. The resistance of the specimens to hydrogen gas embrittlement was revealed by the results of the low-strain-rate tensile tests. Specimens that fractured in gaseous hydrogen at 70 MPa in 233 K underwent shear deformation rather than cup-and-cone deformation. A small difference in the creep deformation was recognized between hydrogen-charged and uncharged specimens.

AB Vanadium alloy (V4Cr4Ti) is a structural material used in future fusion reactors owing to its inherent advantages of high -temperature strength and neutron irradiation resistance. Oxygen pickup and high hydrogen isotope permeability are the two major concerns for their application in various types of blankets. To solve these issues, a bimetallic joint was designed with a CLF-1 layer of reduced -activation ferritic/martensitic (RAFM) steel to resist corrosion and a CLF-1/V4Cr4Ti bonding interface to suppress hydrogen isotope permeation. Samples were prepared from joints bonded via solid-state diffusion under hot isostatic pressing (HIP). Deuterium (D) gas permeation tests were performed at various temperatures in the range 400 -600 degrees C at 100 kPa. After deuterium permeation tests, the thermal desorption spectra (TDS) of the samples were analyzed. And the permeation behavior of deuterium atom across the joints was schematically discussed. The results showed that bonding with steel could be an effective solution for resisting hydrogen isotope permeation through the V4Cr4Ti alloy. Thermal desorption spectrum (TDS) analysis of the tested samples revealed a desorption peak temperature equivalent to that of TiC. The formation of a 1 pm -wide B2 ordered alpha'- [Fe, (V, Ti)] phase layer, together with a large number of dispersed carbides around the interface, played a significant role in the deuterium permeation resistance. In addition, microstructural changes in the steel base material after the 900 degrees C bonding process were beneficial for suppressing deuterium diffusion.

AB Weld cold cracking is a kind of hydrogen embrittlement and is a serious problem when high strength steel is concerned. Cold cracking usually occurs at the area where hydrogen locally accumulates, and hence hydrogen diffusion modelling is important to understand the hydrogen distribution in a welded joint. In this paper, we conducted the permeation tests to measure the apparent diffusion coefficients of hydrogen with varying the hardness and the plastic strain of the steel. The experimental results were used to develop the empirical equation to predict the diffusion coefficient. The empirical equation is described as a function of temperature, hardness and plastic strain. Next, we measured the evolution curves of hydrogen released from the rectangular specimens. We considered the boundary condition of the surface exposed to the atmosphere, and the experimental results were used to determine the boundary condition. The empirical equation and the boundary condition obtained in this paper will be used for the numerical calculations of hydrogen diffusion in a weld cold cracking test in the companion paper.

AB AIM: To discuss the effects of different concentrations of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), an active constituent of Chinese herb, on damaged Shandong human corneal epithelial cell (SDHCEC) induced by hydrogen peroxide.
   METHODS: We detected the combined effects of TMP with concentrations ranging from 4 mg/mL to 0.03 mg/mL and 800 mu M hydrogen peroxide on SDHCEC. The methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay was processed at 3, 6 and 12h separately while the detection of cell apoptosis at 6h only by flow cytometry.
   RESULTS: The viability of SDHCEC with 0.5 mg/mL, 0.25 mg/mL, 0.125 mg/mL and 0.06 mg/mL TMP joint with 800 mu M hydrogen peroxide at 3h and 6h was significantly higher than that with 800 mu M hydrogen peroxide only, P<0.05. However, except 0.25 mg/mL, IMP with other concentrations joint with 800 mu M hydrogen peroxide at 12h could not significantly inhibit decreased SDHCEC viability induced by 800 mu M hydrogen peroxide. At 12h, IMP of 0.5 mg/mL, 0.25 mg/mL, 0.125 mg/mL and 0.06 mg/mL could significantly inhibit SDHCEC early apoptosis induced by 800 mu M hydrogen peroxide, most remarkable at 0.25 mg/mL IMP, P<0.05.
   CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that hydrogen peroxide can induce apoptosis related damage to SDHCEC. IMP can protect SDHCEC from the damage, and the protective effects may be associated with its anti-apoptosis mechanism.

TI Advanced Multi-Step Brazing (AMSB) for fabrication of new type of W/
   stainless steel first-wall component with ODS-Cu intermediate layer
SO FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN
LA English

ID FRACTURE-BEHAVIOR; DEFORMATION
AB The novel method "Advanced Multi-Step Brazing (AMSB)" has been developed to fabricate a new type of "divertor" and "first-wall" heat removal component in a fusion reactor. This study is focused on the latter component, in which a tungsten (W) sheet is jointed through AMSB to a stainless steel (SUS) substrate via an oxide dispersion strengthened copper (ODS-Cu) intermediate layer. The principle of AMSB is a repetitive application of the advanced brazing technique (ABT). The initial purpose of the ABT was to braze W to ODS-Cu (GlidCop (R)) with the Ni-11 %P filler material. Later, we confirmed that the ABT is able to produce a very tough GlidCop (R) and SUS (GlidCop (R)/SUS) joint. One of the major advantages of GlidCop (R)/SUS joints is physically strong tolerance against the repetitive brazing heat-cycle. Thus, a repetitive application of the ABT does not cause any negative effects against post-brazed GlidCop (R)/SUS joints, and hence AMSB can be applied for fabricating a single heat-removal component with multiple joint interfaces. A small-scale sample of the new type of first-wall component was fabricated through two-step brazing. At first, the GlidCop (R) plate was jointed to the SUS by the ABT, and then a thin W-sheet with the thickness of 0.254 mm was jointed to GlidCop (R)/SUS by the ABT. If a large area of the first-wall surface in the fusion reactor can be covered with such a thin W-sheet, the amount of hydrogen isotopes trapped on the first-wall surface could be significantly reduced, compared to other fabrication methods such as a vacuum plasma spray W (VPS-W). The VPS-W is theoretically less dense than a Wsheet and often contains pore structures, which could act as effective trapping sites for hydrogen isotopes. A small-scale sample of the new type of first-wall component with a W-sheet (W/GlidCop (R)/SUS) was successfully fabricated to overcome the above disadvantages. In addition, the W surface of the component showed low retention characteristics of hydrogen isotopes compared with other W surfaces, e.g., atmospheric plasma-sprayed W (APS-W).

AB Understanding hydrogen embrittlement in steels requires research in hydrogen diffusion and trapping at microstructural defects. The present paper deals with hydrogen permeation and trapping at defects in the base material, Armco iron, eliminating effects coupled with alloying and precipitation. Cycled permeation curves are recorded and evaluated by using sound diffusion models to identify hydrogen trap sites as dislocations, grain boundaries and vacancies and assign their trapping energies. Furthermore, trap densities are evaluated and used together with the trapping energies as parameters in an adapted diffusion equation for hydrogen, interpreting the experiments significantly better than simple use of classical Fick's laws.

Optical microscope, electron back-scattered diffraction, and X-ray diffraction were applied to analyze the corresponding microstructure changes. The results show that the hydrogen diffusion coefficient D is mainly determined by the final heattreated peak temperature, and the key microstructural affecting factors of hydrogen permeation will change with this temperature. The order of D from high to low is acicular ferrite, granular bainite, lath bainite, polygonal ferrite, and M-A constituent.

ID WELDABILITY
AB The welding process has been recently introduced to join of the materials fabricated by powder bed fusion (PBF) additive manufacturing (AM) to meet the requirement for the large parts and their repair in service. However, one of the main issues is the high susceptibility to the hydrogen pores occurred during fusion welding of the PBF aluminum (Al) alloys. Autogenous laser welding of a selective laser melting (SLM) AlSi10Mg alloy was firstly carried out in comparison with the casting AlSi10Mg alloy to examine the hydrogen pore characteristics. Singlepass welding with filler powders and laser melting deposition (LMD) welding were then performed on SLM AlSi10Mg alloys to reduce the hydrogen pores. The porosity, microstructure, microhardness and tensile property of the welded joints were investigated. As a result, a high susceptibility to hydrogen pores of SLM AlSi10Mg alloys is occurred in the weld metal (WM) of the welded joint produced by autogenous laser welding and singlepass laser welding due to the high hydrogen content pre-existing in the base metal (BM). However, LMD welding has been shown to effectively reduce the pore size and the porosity generated in the WM of SLM AlSi10Mg alloys. The laser welding of SLM AlSi10Mg alloys produces lower hardness and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) than that of the BM. However, the LMD welding of SLM AlSi10Mg alloys achieves higher hardness and UTS than those of the autogenous laser welding and single-pass laser welding, which is attributed to the refined microstructures and the reduced hydrogen pores in the WM.

AB Carbon-fiber-reinforced thermoplastics (CFRTP)/aluminum hybrid joints are promising for lightweight aircraft design. Welding methods such as friction spot joining (FSpJ) minimize damage to CFRTP fiber structures, making them ideal for hybrid joint fabrication. However, the inherent chemical and physical incompatibility between CFRTP and aluminum hinder strong bonding. To address this, we propose a multiscale interfacial engineering strategy combining mechanical interlocking, covalent/hydrogen bonding, and process optimization. Biomimetic papilla was textured on A6061-T6 aluminum (6061) by femtosecond laser to realize the mechanical interlock with micro and nano scales. Hydroxy group was grafted onto CFRTP to induce the formation of Al-O covalencies and hydrogen bonds, reconstructing the interfacial bonding behavior. The surficial modifications of 6061 and CFRTP worked together to improve the compatibility of the two dissimilar materials. An orthogonal experiment was carried out to optimize the process parameters of friction spot joining (FSpJ), which restrained the formation of the welding defects and increased the density of the interfacial covalent bonds of the hybrid joints. An orthogonal experiment optimized FSpJ parameters, reducing defects and increasing bond density. Meta-learning validated strength prediction with minimal data, supporting parameter selection. The resulting joints achieved highest joining strength of 44.82 MPa and efficiency of 84.57 %. Current work offers a scalable approach for high-reliability CFRTP/metal joints in aerospace and automotive applications.

AB In this work, the hydrogen embrittlement of super duplex stainless steel tubes UNS S32750 under different hydrogen charging conditions was investigated. Hydrogen charging was performed both in unloaded and in elastically stressed specimens. The tubes were charged and tested under two conditions: as-received and welded. The samples were submitted to tensile tests in order to evaluate how the mechanical properties are affected by the hydrogen inserted into the microstructure. The fracture surfaces were analyzed in order to identify the failure active micro mechanisms. Combined tensile test results and microstructural investigations indicated that elastic stress applied to samples during hydrogen charging enhanced hydrogen solubility and permeability, resulting in greater loss of ductility. As pointed by fractographies of welded H-charged tubes, the microstructural changes induced by welding increased hydrogen diffusivity. The fracture surface of the hydrogen charged as-received tubes exhibited a quasi-cleavage aspect, indicating a mixed failure mechanism composed by plastic strain in austenite and cleavage on ferrite. Otherwise, the main mechanism of failure on welded tubes was cleavage. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Joining titanium alloy with carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic (CFRTP) is one of the hot subjects in the automotive and aerospace industries. To improve the joint strength of TC4/CFRTP PA6, this study combined the surface treatment of TC4 alloy, including laser ablation, Silane Coupling Agent (SCA) treatment, and interfacial PA6 adhesive. The results showed that the pretreatment and the laser texturing induced the micro-scale porous and macro-scale groove grid structure, respectively. The superhydrophilicity of the laser texturing as well as amino polar groups induced by SCA treatment promoted the adhesion of the thermoplastic PA6 melt into the microstructure of the TC4 alloy surface. The mechanical interlocking and hydrogen bonding between TC4 alloy and CFRTP PA6 significantly improved the shear strength of the TC4/CFRTP PA6 joint (17.5 MPa). Furthermore, with the incorporation of interfacial PA6 adhesive, the joint strength was further enhanced, and the damage of the TC4/CFRTP PA6 joint was transformed from interfacial to interlaminar CFRTP PA6.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to determine the corrosion fatigue behavior and mechanism of 6005A aluminum alloy and welded joint. Design/methodology/approach Electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) were adopted to characterize the microstructure of 6005A aluminum alloy and welded joint. Through potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and corrosion fatigue experiments, the corrosion fatigue behavior and mechanism of 6005A aluminum alloy base metal and welded joint were studied. Findings The results show that the corrosion fatigue crack initiation of 6005A aluminum alloy base metal and welded joint is mainly caused by the preferential anodic dissolution and hydrogen concentration in the areas with inclusions and welding defects. Originality/value The research is an originality study on the corrosion fatigue behavior and mechanism of 6005A aluminum alloy and welded joint.

AB To investigate the mutual effect of hydrogen, microstructures and stress concentration on the fatigue failure, fatigue behaviors of X65 steel welded joints in both air and saturated H2S solution were investigated at high cycle regime. The experimental result demonstrates that due to lower dislocation density observed by electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD), the fine grain heat affected zone (FGHAZ) is prone to induce cyclic strain localization and further lead to fatigue crack propagating along the FGHAZ in air. Furthermore, the quasi-cleavage with brittle-like fatigue striations and secondary crack on the fracture surface in saturated H2S solution is attributed to hydrogen embrittlement. Moreover, compared with base metal (BM) and FGHAZ, the weld metal (WM) and coarse grain heat affected zone (CGHAZ) are composed of bainite and martensite/austenite (M/A) phase, and more sensitive to hydrogen. Therefore, the fatigue crack is prone to grow along the interface between WM and CGHAZ under the normal applied stress. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB As a joint investigation principle using experimental and theoretical approaches, we report that the anisotropic growth of Pt on Pd nanocubes significantly promotes the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from hydrogen (H-2) and oxygen (O-2). The superior H2O2 productivity of the anisotropic Pd@Pt core@shell nanocrystals results from the enhanced H-2 conversion and the H2O2 selectivity compared to Pd and Pt. From the joint investigation, during the anisotropic growth of the Pd@Pt nanocrystals, high-index facets such as (210) are generated, and they provide numerous active sites for hydrogen dissociation. Notably, even the nano-catalyst is enclosed by Pt shell, the high-index facets are favorable for opening a new route for hydrogen dissolution into the Pd bulk lattices of the Pd@Pt nanocrystals, in which the dissolved hydrogen can react with chemisorbed O-2 over the nanocrystals to form H2O2. This mechanism is suggested by a hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H-2-TPR) analysis, in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This study provides another option to improve the catalytic performance of core@shell nanocrystals via the generation of high-index facets through anisotropic growth of nanocrystals, in addition to the well-known strain and charge transfer effects. We expect that the anisotropic growth approach could be extended to other catalytic reactions.

AB We revealed the effects of hydrogen on the microstructural evolution and passive film properties of a 2205 duplex stainless steel by the joint use of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical measurements. The microstructural analysis results show that effects of hydrogen on the two phases are different: (i) in austenite, stacking faults are induced by hydrogen, and (ii) in ferrite, hydrogen causes an increase of the dislocation density. The XPS analysis revealed that hydrogen reduced the occurrence of Cr2O3 and nitrogen in the passive film, leading to the reduction of their overall thickness. Furthermore, for the first time we demonstrated that the hydrogen release time plays an important role in the electrochemical behavior of the hydrogen charged steel.

AB Controlling the mutual structure between different materials in the heterostructured composites is of key importance in determining their properties and further applications. In this work, joint molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets supported by vertically standing graphene (VSG) were fabricated by full chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, thus leading to precisely tailoring the support-joint coupling structures between VSG support and joint MoS2 nanosheets in the as-fabricated MoS2/VSG or (MoS2-MoO3_x)/VSG hybrid architectures. Which were then directly used as effective, stable and binder-free electrodes for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and revealing that the CVD loading mode of MoS2 (or MoS2-MoO3_x) on VSG support in a vertically or obliquely inserted three-dimensional (3D) architecture has a key influence on improving their HER activities. These results shed light on structural design of multicomponent heterostructures by coupling engineering for various applications.

AB In this study, the susceptibility of API X70 weld joints to hydrogen gas was investigated using slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) tests. The microstructure of the subregion of the actual heat-affected zone (HAZ) weld joint was reproduced by weld thermal-cycle simulation techniques. The SSRT results showed that the weld and cross-weld specimens had the highest hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility, followed by the subregions of the fine-grained heat-affected zone (FGHAZ) and coarse-grained heat-affected zone (CGHAZ) specimens and the base metal. The HE index ranking of the samples was as follows (in increasing sequence): weld, cross-weld, simulated FGHAZ, simulated CGHAZ, and base metal specimens. The rupture location of the cross-weld specimen in ambient air is different to that tested in 10 MPa H-2. The higher susceptibility of the weld and cross-weld specimens was primarily attributed to synergic effects between the microstructural characteristics, stress localization, and microhardness distribution - particularly, microhardness plays an important role in the nucleation of microcracks and the hydrogen diffusion rate induced by stress/strain localization.

AB Armor steels are widely recognized for their exceptional mechanical and ballistic performance, particularly in the fabrication of armored vehicles. Austenitic stainless steel (ASS) wires are commonly used in their welding processes to mitigate hydrogen-induced cracking. However, joints formed using ASS often suffer from reduced ballistic performance due to the strength mismatch (undermatching) compared to the base material. This study explores the application of butt joints, integrating low hydrogen ferritic (LHF) deposits between softer ASS weld layers, which can be expressed as sandwich layer design, in gas metal arc welded (GMAW) armor steel plates. The mechanical properties were evaluated through hardness, tensile, and Charpy V-notch impact tests. Ballistics test performances were measured using depth of penetration (DoP) and width of penetration (WoP) values. The microstructural analysis utilized stereo, optical, and scanning electron microscopes. The results demonstrated that the sandwich joint configuration met the Charpy-V impact toughness requirements of the base metal, achieving 31.4 J and 65 J at-40 degrees C for the WM and HAZ regions, respectively, compared to 20 J for the base material. Moreover, this innovative joint design effectively combined the high toughness and ductility of austenitic wire, reaching a low DoP value of 7.2 mm, with the superior strength of ferritic filler metal, which contributes to a low WoP value of 12.5 mm and a joint efficiency of 48 %. By combining these properties, the joint design significantly enhances ballistic performance in welded regions, traditionally considered vulnerable to ballistic threats, without compromising overall mechanical integrity.

AB This study investigates the mechanical performance of X80 pipeline steel and its welded joints in hydrogenblended natural gas environments at 10 MPa. Slow strain rate tensile, low-cycle fatigue, fatigue crack growth, and fracture toughness tests are conducted on base metal, weld metal, and heat-affected zone. Hydrogen addition reduces ductility, increases fatigue crack growth rate by nearly one order of magnitude, and lowers fracture toughness by up to 51.9 %. The predicted fatigue life decreases by as much as 94.5 % with 30 vol% hydrogen blending. Fatigue crack growth rate and fracture toughness tests indicated that the base metal exhibited the highest hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity, followed by the weld metal and the heat-affected zone. However, all specimens maintain fatigue lives exceeding one million cycles under typical pressure fluctuations. These results suggest that hydrogen transport through existing natural gas pipelines may be feasible when considering the pipe material alone. The findings provide essential data for evaluating the hydrogen compatibility of X80 steel in realistic gas mixtures and contribute to the development of safe hydrogen blending strategies.

AB The surfaces of X80 pipeline steel welded joints were processed with a CO2 laser, and the effects of laser heat treatment (LHT) on H2S stress corrosion in the National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE) solution were analyzed by a slow strain rate test. The fracture morphologies and chemical components of corrosive products before and after LHT were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy, respectively, and the mechanism of LHT on stress corrosion cracking was discussed. Results showed that the fracture for welded joints was brittle in its original state, while it was transformed to a ductile fracture after LHT. The tendencies of hydrogen-induced corrosion were reduced, and the stress corrosion sensitivity index decreased from 35.2% to 25.3%, indicating that the stress corrosion resistance of X80 pipeline steel welded joints has been improved by LHT.

AB The effect of internal hydrogen in the fatigue crack growth rate of the coarse grain region of a 2.25Cr1Mo steel welded joint was analyzed in this work. The microstructure of the coarse grain region was simulated by means of a heat treatment able to provide the same microstructure with a similar prior austenite grain size and hardness to the one in a real welded joint. The fatigue crack growth rate was measured under standard laboratory conditions using compact tensile (CT) specimens that were (i) uncharged and hydrogen pre-charged in a hydrogen pressure reactor (under 19.5 MPa and 450 degrees C for 21 h). The influence of fatigue frequency was assessed using frequencies of 10 Hz, 0.1 Hz, and 0.05 Hz. Additionally, two load ratios (R = 0.1 and R = 0.5) were applied to analyze their influence in the da/dN vs. Delta K curves and therefore in the fatigue crack growth rate. The embrittlement produced by the presence of internal hydrogen was clearly noticed at the beginning of the fatigue crack growth rate test (Delta K = 30 MP root m), obtaining significant higher values than without hydrogen. This effect became more notorious as the test frequency decreased and the load ratio increased. At the same time, the failure mechanism changed from ductile (striations) to brittle (hydrogen decohesion) with intergranular fracture (IG) becoming the predominant failure mechanism under the highest loads (R = 0.5).

AB This study demonstrates effective resistance welding between 7075 aluminum (Al) alloy and carbon fiber/polyether ether ketone (CF/PEEK) composites by combining chemical etching and silanization surface treatments with a polyetherimide (PEI) thermoplastic layer. The effects of this hybrid treatment on the bonding at the 7075 Al alloy/PEI thermoplastic layer interface and the mechanical performance of the welded joints are systematically investigated. Chemical etching created a micro-nano rough surface that enhanced mechanical interlocking and increased hydroxyl group content from 12.7 mol% to 28.5 mol%. Subsequent silanization grafted amino (-NH2) groups onto the 7075 Al alloy surface, enabling hydrogen bonding with the PEI thermoplastic layer. Under the synergistic effects of mechanical interlocking and hydrogen bonding, interfacial bonding is significantly enhanced, increasing the lap shear strength (LSS) of the joint from 0.2 to 24.6 MPa. The fracture failure mode of the welded joint changes from the interfacial failure of the 7075 Al alloy and PEI thermoplastic layer to the interlaminar failure of carbon fiber tearing in the heating element.

AB High temperature in diffusion bonding (DB) process severely deteriorates the performance of zirconium (Zr) R60702 in extreme chemical environment. Therefore, it is important to reduce the DB temperature of Zr R60702. In this work, low-temperature diffusion bonding of Zr R60702 at 750 & DEG;C is realized by 0.3 wt% hydrogen addition while 900 & DEG;C is required in DB process for unhydrogenated Zr R60702. The shear strength of the hydrogenated joint bonded at 750 & DEG;C reaches 388 MPa, which is 117.98% higher than that of the unhydrogenated joint bonded at 750 & DEG;C and equal to that of the unhydrogenated joint bonded at 900 & DEG;C. The effects of hydrogen addition in Zr R60702 on the microstructure evolution, phase transformation temperature, interatomic bonding and self-diffusion coefficient of Zr atoms are investigated in detail. The results show that the optimized DB properties can be attributed to the improvements of its grain boundary diffusion, plasticity and self-diffusion coefficient of Zr atoms.

AB Pipeline welding is an integral part of oil and gas exploration industries. Often the weld failures are observed due to lack of weld quality, improper heat treatment and poor workmanship. Further, the use of new materials in pipeline industry puts focus on a better understanding of requirements for welding and reducing the failures in future. This necessitates the need for development and design of suitable welding fluxes for joining of these materials. In this paper an attempt is made to analyse the effect of commercial submerged arc welding flux and laboratory prepared agglomerated submerged arc welding fluxes (of basic, rutile basic and rutile acidic type) on the weldability, microstructural evolution as well as the structural integrity issues in API X70 line pipe steel welds. The mechanical and microstructural behaviour of weld joints was observed for submerged arc welding fluxes. The maximum tensile strength of 613 N/mm(2) was observed for weld joint prepared using commercial flux (C.F). While in case of agglomerated fluxes the maximum value of tensile strength observed was 561 N/mm(2) for F15B basic flux. Impact toughness for all the weld joints was evaluated both at room temperature and at -65 degrees C. For the weld as well as the heat-affected zone, the maximum impact toughness (160 J and 436 J) was observed for basic flux F5B at room temperature while at - 65 degrees C (16 J and 30 J) impact toughness was obtained which was similar to that obtained with commercial flux. Microhardness of commercial weld joint (232 HV) is maximum as compared to the other weld joints. Maximum microhardness of 222 HV was observed for weld joint fabricated with flux F15B. Flux F15B shows a maximum value of microhardness (218 HV) for the heat-affected zone. Weld joints fabricated by using F3RA and F19RA fluxes exhibit high susceptibility to hydrogen induced cracking as compared to the remaining weld joints. The crack sensitivity ratio (CSR %) is high for weld specimen F3RA (54.64%) and F19RA (50.26%) while weld specimen fabricated using (F5B and C.F) fluxes show minimum crack sensitivity ratio (27.54% & 30.97%) respectively. The high susceptibility towards hydrogen induced cracking may be attributed to the very low value of carbon equivalent as compared to the remaining weld joints.

AB Superwood is a densified wood product that shows promise as a lightweight and renewable alternative for metallic materials. In order for this high-performance new material to be used in multi-material products, it must be able to be joined with other major materials. For example, joining superwood to aluminum would provide a key enabling technology for its use in automotive components since aluminum is presently a major lightweight material for such applications. In this paper, a methacrylate-based adhesive has been identified to provide high lap shear strength (7.5 MPa) for aluminum-to-superwood joints. The aluminum-to-superwood samples were prepared with different amounts of pre-polishing to create openings to the pores in the superwood so adhesive could penetrate into them and create a mechanical interlock, in addition to the hydrogen/chemical bonding at the surface between the methyl methacrylate (MMA) in methacrylate-based adhesive and the cellulose in superwood. For aluminum samples, a thin layer (typically a few nanometers) of oxide film on the surfaces provides hydrogen/chemical bond to MMA structure in the adhesive layer. The failure strength of the superwood-to-aluminum joint sample is about 50% higher than that of natural wood to natural wood joint sample and comparable to that of aluminum-to-aluminum joint sample.

TI Waiting time before NDT of welded offshore steel grades under
   consideration of delayed hydrogen-assisted cracking
SO WELDING IN THE WORLD
LA English
DT Article
DE Welding (GMA); Offshore steels; Non-destructive testing (NDT);
   Diffusible hydrogen Tekken test
AB Offshore wind turbines (OWT) are a major goal of the energy strategy of Germany encompassing the increase of the installed wind power. OWT components are manufactured from welded steel plates with thicknesses up to 200 mm. The underlying standards and technical recommendations for construction of OWTs encompass specifications of so-called minimum waiting time (MWT) before non-destructive testing of the weld joints is allowed. Reason is the increased risk of time-delayed hydrogen-assisted cold cracking as hydrogen diffusion is very slow due to the very thick plates. The strict consideration of those long MWT up to 48 h during the construction of OWTs leads to significant financial burden (like disproportionately high costs for installer ships as well as storage problems (onshore)). In this study, weld joints made of S355 ML were examined in comparison with the offshore steel grade S460 G2+M. The aim was to optimize, i.e., reduce, the MWT before NDT considering varied heat input, hydrogen concentration and using self-restraint weld tests. This would significantly reduce the manufacturing time and costs of OWT construction. To quantify the necessary delay time until hydrogen-assisted cold cracks appear, acoustic emission analysis was applied directly after welding for at least 48 h.

AB The surfaces of welded joints on Grade X80 pipeline steel were processed with a carbon dioxide (CO2) laser, and the effects of this laser heat treatment (LHT) on electrochemical corrosion in a solution saturated with hydrogen sulfde (H2S) were analyzed with electrochemical corrosion tests. The microstructures and residual stresses of the joints were analyzed before and after LHT. The surface corrosion morphologies and chemical components of corrosion products before and after LHT were observed. The results show that the self-corrosion potentials of the welded joints increased from -670 to -600 mV; and the corrosion morphologies changed from total corrosion to local corrosion, with improved corrosion resistance.

AB The replacement of hydrogen with conventional fossil fuel has been viewed as a feasible route to the ZERO emission transportation. Nowadays, the water electrolysis method has become mature and efficient enough to produce large scale of hydrogen, and the condensation and reliquefaction technologies also greatly reduce the hydrogen loss via pipeline transmission, which both motivate the applications of hydrogen as a fuel. In this study, a combined power-hydrogen network is planned to supply the power demand of residential blocks and the charging/fueling demand for electrical vehicles and hydrogen vehicles, respectively. However, the joint scheduling of power-hydrogen network is challenging due to the nonlinearity and nonconvexity inherited from the hydraulic dynamics of hydrogen transmission. To resolve this problem, a convex-concave-based sequential convex approximation method is proposed. A revised 37-bus system is used to demonstrate the validity of proposed method.

AB This work focuses on the corrosion behavior of the friction stir welded joint of aluminum alloy 3003. In order to quantify the quality of FSW joints, the corrosion in the welded joint and the base metal was compared. A gravimetric and thermodynamic study was carried out to determine corrosion resistance. Three aggressive media based on three solutions (sodium chloride, hydrogen chloride, and ethylene glycol) at four temperatures (25 degrees, 45 degrees, 65 degrees, and 85 degrees C) were tested. The results showed that temperature has a strong influence on corrosion rates, which are higher in the metal than in the FSW joint. The presence of ethylene glycol considerably reduces the rate of corrosion, its effect is more marked on the FSW joint. The adsorption of ethylene glycol on the surface of the base metal and that of the FSW joint follows the Langmuir isotherm to form a monolayer on the surface of both samples.

AB Effect of pulsed laser welding parameters (pulse energy and duration, frequency, welding speed and, as a result, overlapping factor) on properties of E110 (Zr-1%Nb) alloy welds is presented. Butt welded joints of two identical plates with a thickness of 0.5 mm were investigated. EDS analysis of a surface layer of the welds was done, initial hydrogen concentration in the weld metal was measured and influence of absorbed gases (oxygen, nitrogen, carbon and hydrogen) on tensile strength, microhardness, hydrogen absorption rate and corrosion resistance of the welds was evaluated. The weld metal contained initial hydrogen concentration within the limits set by standards. However, mixing argon flows with atmospheric gases caused the weld metal contamination with oxygen, nitrogen and carbon. As a result, inclusions of complex chemical composition and surface branching microcracks were formed. They were stress raisers where weld failures occurred. Furthermore, it was the reason of increased hydrogen absorption rate and decreased corrosion resistance of the weld metal. The obtained results showed that absence of discoloration on surfaces of the welded joints did not guarantee metal purity and, as a consequence, required performance properties. Future research is required to determine the optimal overlapping factor; shielding gas compositions (Ar, He or their mixture) and flow rates; configuration and inclination angle of nozzles as well as distance from the nozzles to the weld zone.

AB Historically, few studies have examined sealing failure in twin ferrule pipeline fittings under extreme temperatures. This research investigates their sealing performance in onboard hydrogen systems under such conditions. Experimental results revealed divergent low-temperature sealing behavior: one fitting showed no leakage, while the other leaked 100-200 ppm. Material analyses indicated that surface processing quality influences sealing but is not the decisive factor. Instead, the material mismatch between the front ferrule and the joint body was identified as the primary cause of sealing failure from room temperature to low temperature. Finite element method (FEM) simulations at 19.85 degrees C and -40 degrees C confirmed experimental findings. To reduce hydrogen leakage in fuel cell vehicles at low temperatures, the study recommends using consistent materials for the front ferrule and joint body.

AB The microstructures of high strength bainitic steel weldments were characterized, and their hydrogen permeability was investigated by the electrochemical permeation technique. The effective diffusion coefficient in the welded joint increases with heat input, while the hydrogen concentration at the sub-surface decreases with increasing heat input, mainly due to coarsening grain and inclusion sizes. Compared with as-welded specimens, the tempered membranes have lower effective diffusion coefficient and higher density of hydrogen traps due to newly formed carbides acting as hydrogen trapping sites that are derived from the decomposition of martensite-austenite constituents. These were further confirmed by the partial permeation technique. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In order to make full use of renewable energy and improve the utilization of wind power, a new joint optimization scheme of the wind-hydrogen system coupled with transmission project is proposed in this paper, in which wind power is reasonably allocated for grid integration and for hydrogen production. Aiming at maximize the annul wind-hydrogen system benefit, the optimal sizes of wind power transmission project and hydrogen system are obtained under different hydrogen production modes, hydrogen trading modes and hydrogen demand levels. In addition, the penalty cost of wind curtailment and hydrogen supply shortage and the system environmental benefits are taken into account. Results show: during the long-term of insufficient of wind power, it is better to produce hydrogen using wind power and grid-assisted power to avoid hydrogen supply shortage; considering the future increase of hydrogen demand, the optimal supply number of hydrogen refueling stations in the wind-hydrogen system is two. Also, the low utilization of fuel cells means that the benefit from regeneration cannot offset the high cost, which leads to the abnegation of fuel cells in the wind-hydrogen system.

Hydrogen desorption and hydrogen sorption from gaseous mixtures were analysed. The calculated results are compared with experimental data obtained in the Joint Institute of High Temperatures of the Russian Academy of Science. The agreement between the calculated results and the experimental data is demonstrated to be satisfactory. It is indicated that to increase the efficiency of hydrogen purification in a metal-hydride reactor, the thickness of the porous bed cooled by external water must be no more than 6-8 mm.

AB Hydrogen-induced cracking behavior in high-strength steel mainly composed of martensite was analyzed by acoustic emission (AE) technique and finite element method (FEM) in slow strain-rate tensile (SSRT) tests and welding tests. The crack initiation was detected by the AE signals, and the time evolution of stress concentration and hydrogen diffusion were calculated by FEM. The effect of hardness and plastic strain on the hydrogen diffusion coefficient was explicitly introduced into the governing equation in FEM. The criterion and indicator parameter for the crack initiation were derived as a function of maximum principal stress and locally accumulated hydrogen concentration. The results showed that the cracking criterion derived by AE and FEM is useful for predicting the cold cracking behavior and determining the critical preheat temperature to prevent hydrogen-induced cracking.

AB The 316LN Stainless Steel (SS) weld joints were fabricated using Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) Welding and Activated Flux Tungsten Inert Gas (A-TIG) Welding techniques with suitable process parameters. Initially, basic mechanical properties were evaluated across weld joints. Further microstructural study of the base metal, TIG, and A-TIG joints were accomplished using Optical Microscopy (OM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) techniques. The microstructural characterization revealed higher grain size variations at the fusion zone of the A-TIG joint due to the slow cooling rate and reversed Marangoni convection effect. The Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) susceptibility of the TIG and A-TIG welded joints was assessed using five different loading/Stress conditions. The constant load boiling 45 wt% Magnesium Chloride Hexahydrate (MgCl(2 center dot)6H(2)O) solution as per ASTM G36-94 standard was used to evaluate the SCC susceptibility of the welded joints. The SCC (crack initiation and propagation) of the base metal and welded joints occurred by the anodic dissolution and Hydrogen Induced Cracking mechanisms. For the welded joints additionally, the dissolution of the delta-ferrite increased the crack growth rate. The A-TIG joint exhibited lesser SCC resistance than the TIG joint for the following major reasons: (i) Formation of the large dendrites (ii) Presence of the higher grain size variations at the fusion zone. Moreover, both welded joints showed lesser SCC resistance than the base metal due to the dissolution of the delta-ferrite and the residual stress formation. The fractographic studies for the base metal, TIG, and A-TIG joints revealed the brittle nature of transgranular SCC failure.

AB The carbide characteristics of 2.25Cr1Mo0.25V steel have an extremely important influence on the mechanical properties of welding joints. In addition, hydrogen resistance behavior is crucial for steel applied in hydrogenation reactors. The carbide morphology was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the carbide microstructure was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Tensile and impact tests were carried out and the influence of carbides on properties was studied. A hydrogen diffusion test was carried out, and the hydrogen brittleness resistance of welding metal and base metal was studied by tensile testing of hydrogenated samples to evaluate the influence of hydrogen on the mechanical properties. The research results show that the strength of the welding metal was slightly higher and the Charpy impact value was significantly lower compared to the base metal. The hydrogen embrittlement resistance of the welding metal was stronger than that of the base metal. The presence of more carbides and inclusions was the main cause of the decreased impact property and hydrogen brittleness resistance of the welding metal. These conclusions have certain reference value for designing and manufacturing hydrogenation reactors.

AB An initial thermal power dispatch (TPD) concept of operations was evaluated that couples a nuclear power plant to a nearby hydrogen production plant. GSE Systems' generic pressurized water reactor full-scope simulator was modified with a TPD model comprised of a thermal power extraction and delivery system. A prototype human-system interface (HSI) was developed to interact with the TPD model and allow participants to execute the basic operating scenarios for normal operations. Four retired operators performed the evaluation, and due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, the original in-person experimental design was restructured to support a remote participator evaluation using a web meeting platform. Data from operator feedback, observations from the research team, and quantitative survey responses revealed that the initial TPD concept of operations is feasible. The operators were comfortable with the engineered system and HSI and could manage it without adverse impacts to reactor power, plant safety, or equipment. Findings are discussed in terms of both the TPD system design and HSI performance.

AB The recent literature has demonstrated that overbuilding & proactive curtailment of renewables is a necessary puzzle piece in achieving the lowest-cost firm power, which is the kind of power from renewables that can satisfy load demand with 100% certainty-firming up renewables, which can be gauged via firm kWh premium, is synonymous with turning the business-as-usual variable renewables into effectively dispatchable ones and implies curtailed power. Although some studies have examined the benefits of utilizing curtailed electricity for hydrogen production, there is currently a lack of in-depth exploration on how to economically configure a fully renewables-dominated firm generation system and a hydrogen production system while ensuring 100% load fulfillment. Besides, various firm power enablers, which refer to technologies that help achieve firm generation, such as wind-solar blending or the aforementioned overbuilding, are often limited to quantitative analyses. Thus, this work evaluates the feasibility of utilizing nearly zero-cost curtailed power for hydrogen production in the context of firm power generation. Two highlights of this work that differentiate it from previous studies are that: (1) a theoretical paradigm for the coordinated deployment of a firm wind-photovoltaic-battery system under a firm-power condition and a hydrogen system has been established from the perspectives of joint optimization and separate optimization; and (2) the deep coupling relationships among various enablers are investigated, and a qualitative analysis is conducted on the impacts of battery storage sharing and wind-solar blending in reducing the system premium in the domain of firm power delivery. The case study demonstrates the economic viability of including hydrogen production in a firm renewable system. The firm kWh premium of the joint strategy reaches a value of 1.82, whereas the separate strategy sees an increase to 2.23. Compared to the absence of battery storage sharing, utilizing shared storage reduces the system premium by 44.85%. Besides, the premium increases by 27.47% when the wind farm is not installed. These results reveal that joint optimization, battery storage sharing, and wind-solar blending can all contribute beneficially towards a firm-power setup.

ID MECHANISM; BEHAVIOR
AB The use of Mg alloys for vehicle weight reduction has been increasing rapidly worldwide. Gas metal arc welding (GMAW) has the potential for mass-production welding of Mg alloys. Recently, the University of Wisconsin demonstrated in bead-on-plate GMAW of Mg alloys that: 1) the issue of severe spatter, which has long delayed the use of GMAW for Mg alloys, can be eliminated by using controlled short circuiting (CSC), and 2) the issue of severe hydrogen porosity can be eliminated by removing Mg(OH)(2), which forms on the welding wire surface over time. The present study aimed at actual butt and lap joint welding of Mg alloys by CSC-GMAW. The most widely used wrought Mg alloy AZ31 Mg (Mg-similar to-3Al-1Zn-0.2Mn) was welded by CSC-GMAW. Sound welds were made without spatter and hydrogen porosity, with butt joint welds approaching 100% of the base-metal strength. However, three new significant issues were found to occur easily and degrade the weld quality significantly: 1) formation of oxide films inside butt joint welds, 2) formation of high crowns on butt joint welds, and 3) formation of fingers from lap joint welds. These three new issues, like the issues of spatter and porosity investigated previously, were caused mainly by the unusual physical and chemical properties of Mg, rather than the welding process itself. These properties include the low liquid density, low solid deformability, low liquid fluidity, and high oxygen affinity of Mg. The mechanisms of their formation were established, and the methods for their elimination or reduction were demonstrated.

DE Liquefied hydrogen; HAZID; Risk assessment; Incidents
AB The objectives of the IDEALHY project, which receives funding from the European Union's 7th Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) for the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Technology Initiative under grant agreement No. 278177, are to design a novel process that will significantly increase the efficiency of hydrogen liquefaction and be capable of delivering liquid hydrogen at a rate that is an order of magnitude greater than current plants. The liquid hydrogen could then be delivered to refueling stations in road tankers. This paper describes the scope of the safety work within IDEALHY, focussing in particular on two HAZID exercises and a review of incidents. In particular, an analysis of the causes and consequences of accident scenarios is presented. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Protein neutron crystallography is a powerful technique to determine the positions of H atoms, providing crucial biochemical information such as the protonation states of catalytic groups and the geometry of hydrogen bonds. Recently, the crystal structure of a bacterial copper amine oxidase was determined by joint refinement using X-ray and neutron diffraction data sets at resolutions of 1.14 and 1.72 angstrom, respectively [Murakawa et al. (2020). Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 117, 10818-10824]. While joint refinement is effective for the determination of the accurate positions of heavy atoms on the basis of the electron density, the structural information on light atoms (hydrogen and deuterium) derived from the neutron diffraction data might be affected by the X-ray data. To unravel the information included in the neutron diffraction data, the structure determination was conducted again using only the neutron diffraction data at 1.72 angstrom resolution and the results were compared with those obtained in the previous study. Most H and D atoms were identified at essentially the same positions in both the neutron-only and the X-ray/neutron joint refinements. Nevertheless, neutron-only refinement was found to be less effective than joint refinement in providing very accurate heavy-atom coordinates that lead to significant improvement of the neutron scattering length density map, especially for the active-site cofactor. Consequently, it was confirmed that X-ray/neutron joint refinement is crucial for determination of the real chemical structure of the catalytic site of the enzyme.

AB This work analyses the trading of strategic merchant hydrogen technologies in energy and ancillary services markets. The hydrogen firms trade in two markets: (1) a joint hydrogen and energy/reserves day -ahead market and (2) the balancing settlements market. We contrast the co -optimised markets with trading in an energy -only market. Trading both energy and ancillary services leads hydrogen firms to produce and use more hydrogen, leading to less reliance on fossil fuels and an increase in the revenue streams of the electrolysis -based firms. The problem is formulated as a stochastic multi -leader -multi -follower model. Each leader firm solves a bi-level Stackelberg problem. The upper -level is the Nash game among strategic firms. The lower -level is an instance of a Generalised Nash Equilibrium of the followers.

AB This work evaluates the effect of hydrogen on the mechanical integrity of a weld in a martensitic base metal. Different regions in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) are reproduced to investigate the interaction of the local microstructure with hydrogen. The hardness strongly depends on the distance from the welding joint due to the different phases present. The HAZ contains zones of acicular ferrite, coarse martensite and tempered martensite. Additionally, the entire weld is subjected to a constant load while being simultaneously electrochemically charged with hydrogen. During this test, a crack initiates in the filler, showing the highest hydrogen solubility as demonstrated by thermal desorption spectroscopy, while propagation occurs along the microstructure of the HAZ with the highest hardness level.

ID OPTIMAL OPERATION
AB The integration of green energy sources such as hydrogen and natural gas plays a vital role in advancing lowcarbon energy goals. Conventional integrated energy systems (IES) employing hydrogen-compressed natural gas (HCNG) typically operate with fixed mixing ratio, limiting flexibility and overlooking positive market feedback effects. This study proposes an optimal scheduling strategy for an IES with a dynamic hydrogen blending ratio within a joint carbon-green certificate trading framework. This model considers wind power penetration impacts on electrolysis efficiency using a dynamic electrolyzer efficiency model and incorporates operation and maintenance costs of HCNG pipelines. A trading strategy based on equivalence between green certificates and carbon quotas is developed to improve economic performance and emissions reduction. The influence of hydrogen production levels on carbon trading and market revenues is examined. A case study demonstrates that this method achieves a 25.16 % cost reduction, 17.21 % decrease in emissions, and 98.8 %a wind energy utilization.

AB The effect of ultrasonic nanocrystal surface modification (UNSM) on the corrosion and stress corrosion cracking behavior of low carbon steel (ASTM A139) welded joint in the simulated district heating water (internal heating water) were investigated. After UNSM treatment, the microstructures of welded joint were transformed from the grain boundary ferrite and wid-manstatten ferrite to polygonal ferrite accompanied by grain refinement. In electrochemical tests, the corrosion resistance of the welded joint was increased after UNSM treatment as a result of the grain refinement and improved stability of the oxide film. The stress corrosion cracking behavior was measured by slow strain rate tests with accelerated anodic and cathodic reactions. The results indicated that the UNSM treatment had a significant effect on the corrosion condition, whereas UNSM had no effect on hydrogen embrittlement.

AB Oxy-fuel combustion technology offers a promising solution for achieving nearly zero carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired units, presenting a viable path toward low-carbon dispatch. This study establishes a simulation model for the low-carbon operation of power systems, focusing on the integrated operation of an oxy-fuel combustion plant and electric hydrogen production. By incorporating oxygen generated from electric hydrogen production into the oxy-fuel combustion plant, the primary objective is to minimize system operation costs. Through simulation analysis and verification, a comparative scenario is constructed to evaluate performance. The simulation results indicate that the joint operation approach yields significant benefits. In comparison to separate operation, the joint operation strategy leads to a reduction of approximately 7.38% in total system costs, 18.79% in operating costs, and 23.56% in carbon emissions. This integrated approach not only achieves lower carbon emissions but also results in reduced overall system costs.

HSC behaviours were compared for base metal (BM) and transverse-weld joints (WJs) using in-situ slow strain rate testing (SSRT) with hydrogen charging. The HSC resistivity of transverse WJs was inferior to that of BM. The transverse WJs were fractured in the BM during SSRT in hydrogen-free condition. The in-situ SSRT changed the fracture location to the inter-critical heat affected zone (ICHAZ) for transverse WJs and granular bainite in ICHAZ acted as the initiation site of HSC in transverse welds.

AB The proton/hydrogen redox couple underpins the electrochemical sciences; however, the nonunity stoichiometry of the reaction leads to distinct voltammetric complications. This Article provides a joint analytical, numerical, and experimental investigation into the reversible hydrogen evolution reaction at a platinum microelectrode. Literature obscurities and nuances are highlighted and corrected, allowing the presentation of an holistic overview of the electrochemical reaction at the reversible limit. Under such conditions, it is demonstrated, first, how the reaction may be misinterpreted as being irreversible and, second, that the transfer coefficient for the reversible (Nernstian) hydrogen evolution reaction is equal to 2. Importantly, the use of the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) as a reference potential in voltammetric experiments is critically evaluated.

AB The permeation of hydrogen in the X80 steel was studied in this paper through thermal desorption spectroscopy, stepwise hydrogen permeation experiments and finite element modelling. Firstly, one kind of shallow trap and deep traps in X80 steel were identified through thermal desorption spectroscopy and the corresponding binding energies were obtained. According to the experiment and simulation, the deep hydrogen traps can significantly retard the first hydrogen permeation process but have almost no effect during the following charging. The X80 steel used in hydrogen compressed natural gas pipelines is exposed to hydrogen for long periods and deep traps are filled, its hydrogen permeation process is more in line with the stepwise hydrogen charging. Therefore, the stepwise hydrogen charging experiments were performed and the apparent diffusion coefficients (Dapp) and the hydrogen trap density involved in the hydrogen permeation transient (N1) were obtained using three different thickness samples. Then, a quantitative relationship in X80 steel was fitted between the N1 and the variation of hydrogen concentration. Based on the quantitative relationship and the hydrogen trap binding energies, a hydrogen perme-ation model in X80 steel was established. By comparing the hydrogen permeation curves obtained by our model under different boundary conditions with experiment curves, it is found that the constant concentration boundary condition model can better describe the hydrogen permeation kinetic in X80 steel under electrochemical hydrogen charging. As a result, this model can be used to predict the distribution of hydrogen in X80 steel, laying the foundation for predicting the occurrence of hydrogen embrittlement in pipeline steels.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB HyResponder is a European Hydrogen Train the Trainer programme for responders. This paper describes the key outputs of the project and the steps taken to develop and implement a long-term sustainable train the trainer programme in hydrogen safety for responders across Europe and beyond. This FCH2 JU (now Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking) funded project has built on the successful outcomes of the previous HyResponse project. HyResponder has developed further and updated educational, operational, and virtual reality training for trainers of responders to reflect the state-of-the-art in hydrogen safety, including liquid hydrogen, and expand the programme across Europe and specifically within the 10 countries represented directly within the project consortium: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. For the first time, four levels of educational materials from fire fighter through to specialist have been developed. The digital training resources are available on the e-Platform (https://hyresponder.eu/eplatform/). The revised European Emergency Response Guide is now available to all stakeholders. The resources are intended to be used to support national training programs. They are available in 8 languages: Czech, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Norwegian and Spanish. Through the HyResponder activities, trainers from across Europe have undertaken joint actions which are in turn being used to inform the delivery of regional and national training both within and beyond the project. The established pan-European network of trainers is shaping the future in the important for inherently safer deployment of hydrogen systems and infrastructure across Europe and enhancing the reach and impact of the programme.

AB Two-dimensional Ti3C2Tx MXene was incorporated into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) via in-situ template method, forming MXene/PVA hydrogel (MPH) through hydrogen bonding between PVA chains and MXene surface groups. After 3-5 freeze-thaw cycles, the composite achieved free-standing capability, with SEM and FT-IR confirming molecular-level interactions. The 3 wt% MXene-doped MPH strain sensor exhibited exceptional sensitivity: 29.9 at >200 % elongation, and 3.43 (0-100 %) and 6.96 (100-200 %) within lower strain ranges, satisfying both wide detection range and high sensitivity requirements. When applied to joint motion monitoring, the sensor effectively distinguished signals from different joints and varying bending angles of the same joint, demonstrating promising potential for wearable healthcare applications.

AB The first wall (FW) of a water cooled ceramic breeder (WCCB) blanket uses ferritic/martensitic steel (FMS) as structural material and tungsten (W) as armor material. The FW is exposed to fusion reaction fuels: deuterium (D) or tritium (T) plasma; and HT, T-2, or HTO produced in breeding reactions. Titanium (Ti) is required as an interlayer in a W/FMS welding joint formed by hot isostatic pressing (HIP). However, Ti is sensitive to hydrogen (H) embrittlement which can result from the concentration and diffusion of H isotopes at welding interfaces. Qualitative analysis of the effect of D concentration on the W/Ti/FMS bonding quality was performed. The experiments demonstrated that D can affect the microstructure and mechanical properties of the W/Ti/FMS joints at lower D concentrations. Excessive TiD2 will turn the Ti interlayer into powder, and finally lead to joint failure at higher D concentrations. The H isotope concentration in the joints shall be strictly controlled to ensure steady operation of the fusion reactor.

AB Welding porosity defects significantly reduce the mechanical properties of welded joints. In this paper, the hydrogen porosity evolution coupled with dendrite growth during solidification in the molten pool of Al-4.0 wt pct Cu alloy was modeled and simulated. Three phases, including a liquid phase, a solid phase, and a gas phase, were considered in this model. The growth of dendrites and hydrogen gas pores was reproduced using a cellular automaton (CA) approach. The diffusion of solute and hydrogen was calculated using the finite difference method (FDM). Columnar and equiaxed dendrite growth with porosity evolution were simulated. Competitive growth between different dendrites and porosities was observed. Dendrite morphology was influenced by porosity formation near dendrites. After solidification, when the porosities were surrounded by dendrites, they could not escape from the liquid, and they made pores that existed in the welded joints. With the increase in the cooling rate, the average diameter of porosities decreased, and the average number of porosities increased. The average diameter of porosities and the number of porosities in the simulation results had the same trend as the experimental results.

AB Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) AlSi10Mg alloy exhibits high susceptibility to hydrogen porosity during fusion welding, and the mechanical properties of the welded joint are significantly reduced compared to the base metal (BM). In this study, LPBF AlSi10Mg alloy was welded using laser metal deposition (LMD) process, followed by direct aging (DA) heat treatment at 160 degrees C for 6 h. The porosity characteristics, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the welded joints were investigated, along with an in-depth analysis of the pore formation mechanism and the strengthening mechanism induced by DA heat treatment. The results show that the increase in the number of weld passes can significantly reduce both the hydrogen pore diameter and porosity in the weld metal (WM). The porosity concentration is notably higher at the inter-pass region. After DA heat treatment, the proportion of spherical and short rod-like Si phases in the WM increased, and the connectivity of eutectic Si networks also improved. Additionally, DA heat treatment reduces kernel average misorientation and geometric necessary dislocations, decreases low-angle grain boundaries proportion, and slightly increases grain size. Schmid factor analysis confirms reduced slip system activation, improving crack resistance via strengthening from nano-Si precipitates. DA heat treatment enhanced the average hardness of the welded joints, with the maximum average hardness reaching 111.04 HV. The tensile strength of the joint reached 293.6 MPa, with an elongation of 1.7%. The enhancement of mechanical properties is attributed to the precipitation strengthening of silicon elements following DA heat treatment.

AB Power-to-Hydrogen (P2H) clean systems have been increasingly adopted for Virtual Power Plant (VPP) to drive system decarbonization. However, current models for the joint operation of VPP and P2H often disregard the full impact on grid operation or hydrogen supply to multiple consumers. This paper contributes with a VPP operating model considering a full Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (AC OPF) while integrating different paths for the use of green hydrogen, such as supplying hydrogen to a Combined Heat and Power (CHP), industry and local hydrogen consumers. The proposed framework is tested using a 37-bus distribution grid and the results illustrate the benefits that a P2H plant can bring to the VPP in economic, grid operation and environmental terms. An important conclusion is that depending on the prices of the different hydrogen services, the P2H plant can increase the levels of self-sufficiency and security of supply of the VPP, decrease the operating costs, and integrate more renewables.

AB In this work, heat treatments were performed on autogenously laser welding of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) AlSi10Mg alloys to improve mechanical properties of welded joints. After welding, the welded joint was heat treated by direct aging (DA) and solution heat treatment and artificial aging (T6) treatment. The porosity, microstructure and mechanical performance of the welded joints after DA and T6 treatments were investigated and compared with the as-welded joint. Results show that the microhardness of weld metal (WM) has been increased to over 93.5 HV0.1 after DA treatment, while the microhardness in the T6 welded joint is reduced to 77.0 HV0.1, from 82.0 HV0.1 in the as-welded joint. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the DA treated joint reaches 276.5 MPa, showing an increase of 43.0% compared with as-welded joint. The DA heat treatment of the LPBF AlSi10Mg welded joints effectively improves the hardness and the UTS, which can be mainly attributable to the reduction of the hydrogen pores, the enhancing effect of solid solution strengthening coming from the Si element in the Al matrix and the dispersion strengthening of Si precipitation.

AB Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is widely considered as a promising material for joint implants but it still has limitations involving high friction and wear. To mimic the cartilage-subchondral bone structure in natural joints, a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel layer was fabricated on the PEEK substrate to provide a lubrication mechanism. In addition, tannic acid was applied to form dynamic hydrogen bonds with PVA molecules, for the purpose of strengthening the hydrogel layer and endowing it with self-healing ability. Our experimental results demonstrated that the prepared PEEK-hydrogel composite exhibited good biotribological performance with a low average friction coefficient around 0.06 and little wear after the friction test. It also could repair the scratch made by a blade spontaneously at room temperature taking advantage of the reversibility of the hydrogen bonds. The influence of the properties of the PVA hydrogel and the concentration of tannic acid on the frictional and self-healing behavior of the composite structure was investigated and the internal mechanism was discussed. This work presents a facile method to fabricate a PEEK-hydrogel composite possessing outstanding tribological properties and self-healing capacity simultaneously, hopefully promoting its potential in producing artificial joints.

AB 7N01-T4 aluminum alloy is widely applied to high speed train body material attributed to its excellent comprehensive mechanical properties; however, its high sensitivity to hydrogen stress corrosion would seriously restrict its further application. In this study, the hydrogen-induced stress corrosion of the base metal and the joint was investigated under slow strain rate test to ascertain the characteristics and mechanism of hydrogen-induced stress corrosion cracking of aluminum alloy. By applying the cathode potential, the morphology of tensile port was studied. Results show that under the action of tensile stress, the free atomic hydrogen produced in the corrosion process or absorbed hydrogen diffuses along the grain boundary into the crack tip region, weakens the grain boundary and causes hydrogen embrittlement, thus accelerating the crack propagation and fracture. These properties provide a broader prospect for the application of 7N01-T4 aluminum alloy in high-speed train body.

AB Background: The purpose of this study was to determine whether preoperative skin preparation with hydrogen peroxide reduces intraoperative culture positivity for Cutibacterium acnes in shoulder arthroplasty.
   Methods: This was a prospective, controlled, parallel/noncrossover, nonrandomized, single-blinded trial registered at clinicaltrials.gov. We included a consecutive series of patients scheduled to undergo primary anatomic or reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. The first group of patients underwent a standard skin preparation and the second group underwent the same preparation with the addition of hydrogen peroxide. We then took skin, dermis, glenohumeral joint, and air (negative control) aerobic and anaerobic culture swabs. We blinded the laboratory analyzing the samples. An a priori power analysis determined that 56 patients would be needed to see a 50% reduction in culture positivity rates. We also conducted a post hoc gender-stratified analysis.
   Results: Between January 2017 and October 2018, the authors performed 124 primary shoulder arthroplastics, of which we included 65 and collected samples on 61. There were no demographic differences. There were fewer patients within the peroxide group with triple-positive cultures (skin, dermis, and joint) (0% vs. 19%, P = .024) and positive cultures from the joint (10% vs. 35%, P = .031). In our subgroup analysis, these differences were only significant in males. The vast majority of positive cultures were with C. acnes.
   Conclusion: Although larger, randomized studies are needed, adding hydrogen peroxide to the preoperative skin preparation may be a low-cost, low-risk method to reduce deep tissue contamination with C. acnes, particularly within males.

AB Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) behavior and mechanism of E690 welded joint in simulated marine atmosphere containing SO2 were investigated using SSRT method and electrochemical measurements. Results showed that it had very high SCC susceptibility in this environment with a combined mechanism of anodic dissolution and hydrogen embrittlement (HE). The intercritical heat affected zone in the welded joint was the most vulnerable location to SCC because this zone has less strength, more negative potential, and higher corrosion current density. The M-A constituents had a detrimental effect on SCC behavior in the synergetic effect of stress concentration, micro-galvanic corrosion, and HE. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The gas tungsten arc-welded 304 stainless steel joints were prepared using two distinct welding parameters (current and welding speed). The evolution of the microstructure, the mechanisms of stress corrosion cracking (SCC), and the electrochemical corrosion behavior of the welded joints were then studied. The results indicate that the microstructure of the welded joints is mainly dendrite, and the main phase's average grain size of base metal (16.36 mu m) is much higher than that of the welded joints (6.61 mu m and 7.14 mu m). Welded joints characterized by higher welding currents and speeds exhibit reduced sensitivity to SCC. Notably, joints under higher welding current and speed significantly enhance corrosion resistance, as evidenced by a lower passive current density (ipass = 4.54 x 10-7 A/cm2), a wide passive range (LIE = 217 mV). Furthermore, the accumulation of chloride ions at stress concentration sites of welded joints contributes to pitting corrosion. This stress concentration at the pitting sites exacerbates anodic dissolution and hydrogen accumulation, ultimately leading to failure.

After hydrogen charging for 2 h, irreversible dome-shaped blisters and internal cracking began to appear on the surface of the base metal. However, after hydrogen charging for 16 h, cracking formed along the thermo-mechanically affected zone boundary, while the blisters or cracking were hardly observed in the stir zone. In addition, the stir zone showed a plasticity reduction from 38% to 28%, much less than that of the base metal reduced from 48% to 2%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes validation of the computational fluid dynamics tool FLACS-Hydrogen. The validation study focuses on concentration and pressure data from vented deflagration experiments performed in 20-foot shipping containers as part of the project Improving hydrogen safety for energy applications through pre-normative research on vented deflagrations (HySEA), funded by the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking (FCH 2 JU). The paper presents results for tests involving inhomogeneous hydrogen-air clouds generated from realistic releases performed during the HySEA project. For both experiments and simulations, the peak overpressures obtained for the stratified mixtures are higher than those measured for lean homogeneous mixtures with the same amount of hydrogen. Using an in-house version of FLACS-Hydrogen with the numerical solver Flacs3 and improved physics models results in significantly improved predictions of the peak overpressures, compared to the predictions by the standard Flacs2 solver. The paper includes suggestions for further improvements to the model system. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The hydrogen distribution in a hydrogen-charged Fe-18Mn-1.2C (wt%) twinning-induced plasticity austenitic steel was studied by Scanning Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (SKPFM). We observed that 1-2 days after the hydrogen-charging, hydrogen showed a higher activity at twin boundaries than inside the matrix. This result indicates that hydrogen at the twin boundaries is diffusible at room temperature, although the twin boundaries act as deeper trap sites compared to typical diffusible hydrogen trap sites such as dislocations. After about 2 weeks the hydrogen activity in the twin boundaries dropped and was indistinguishable from that in the matrix. These SKPFM results were supported by thermal desorption spectrometry and scanning electron microscopic observations of deformation-induced surface cracking parallel to deformation twin boundaries. With this joint approach, two main challenges in the field of hydrogen embrittlement research can be overcome, namely, the detection of hydrogen with high local and chemical sensitivity and the microstructure-dependent and spatially resolved observation of the kinetics of hydrogen desorption.

AB In the present article, we propose a fully coupled thermo-elasto-plastic-damage theory, which includes both kinematic and isotropic hardening, and also accounts for hydrogen diffusion in metals. This theory is based on the thermodynamics of irreversible processes under small deformation hypothesis and suppose that hydrogen diffuses in both normal interstitial lattice sites and trapping sites. This model is implemented into Abaqus/Standard by developing a UEL user subroutine and using an "assumed strain" method. A numerical application is performed to simulate hydrogen diffusion in a metallic welded joint submitted to a long-time severe environment at constant temperature.

AB The failure (fracture) mechanism of a welded front axle tube structure made of C45E4 steel from a mini truck was analyzed. The fracture occurred on the right side of the right support frame with the fracture surface perpendicular to the tube axis. SEM examination showed that the fracture surface could be divided into three areas: intergranular area, cleavage area and dimple area. Crack initiation site of the failed front axle tube was at the front weld joint fixing the right support frame on the axle tube. The crack propagated in two opposite directions along the circumference of the tube and converged at the dimple area. Intergranular fracture was found to be in heat affected zone (HAZ). With higher magnification, fine dimples, intergranular and trans-granular fracture characteristics were observed in the crack initiation site. By metallurgical examination, Widmanstatten ferrites, which could decrease the toughness and strength of the weld joint, were observed in the columnar grains. The hardness of HAZ coarse grain area (623 VHN) was far higher than HAZ fine grain area (310 VHN) and base metal (225 VHN). As the weld process indicates, neither pre-weld nor post-weld treatment was carried out. A non-uniform temperature distribution around the weld joint could generate large thermal residual tensile stress in HAZ; thus, the material was very unstable. It could fracture for very small or even no external stress. Hydrogen atoms would be released during welding and microstructures with the highest hardness are the most susceptible of hydrogen assisted cracking. It is concluded that the fracture was caused by hydrogen assisted brittleness under the induction of weld residual stress. Post-weld aging treatment (PWAT) is recommended to release the residual stress generated during welding process. In this case, PWAT was carried out on the failed weld joint and Vickers hardness of HAZ coarse grain area, HAZ fine grain area and base metal decreased to 232 VHN, 205 VHN and 125 VHN, respectively. That indicates that the PWAT procedure could effectively soften the material and relieve residual stress.

For this purpose, under production conditions the change in molten aluminum alloys series 1XXX hydrogen content is analyzed in the main stages from the aluminum electrolyzer to the casting machine. Production operations are determined within which there is significant melt impregnation with hydrogen. Research precision is provided by using a developed procedure for molten sample collection in the main production operations and considering the specific nature of production. Technical solutions are proposed from research results aimed at reducing melt hydrogen expansion.

AB The increasing demand for sustainable energy efficiency and industrial decarbonisation leads researchers from different areas to seek alternative and more effective ways for attaining these goals. A hydrogen economy based on fuel cell and hydrogen technologies is a plausible and promising way to reach the European energy targets and improve the quality of life of society, providing independence and security of the energy supply across Europe. The need for rapid deployment of environment-friendly technologies implies for integrated policy measures and joint efforts of all Member States. This paper gives an overview of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies considering intensively their place in the European policy for decarbonisation and smart growth. The paper also discusses international initiatives in the field and suggests a pathway for greener society.

AB The hydrogen embrittlement of the friction stir welded high carbon steel plates was evaluated by the cathodic hydrogen charging method. The welding was performed below Ac1 transformation point and therefore the stir zone of the welds contained refined ferrite matrix distributed with cementite particles. After hydrogen charging for 4 h, large quantities of irreversible dome-shaped blisters were formed on the surface of the base metal. However, no blisters were observed in the stir zone even after charging for 16 h. In addition, hydrogen-induced internal cracks were formed throughout the thickness of the base metal. But the development of the internal cracks in the base metal was restricted when getting close to the stir zone. The hydrogen charged stir zone showed less reduction of ductility than the base metal during tensile testing, which reveals that the friction stir welded steel joints showed higher resistance to hydrogen embrittelment than base metal.

AB The Pipe-Soil Potentials (PSP) offset of buried metal pipelines caused by geomagnetic storms will threaten the operation safety of hybrid energy transmission pipeline with hydrogen and superconducting cable. It is a critical issue in the planning and design of hydrogen-electricity hybrid pipelines. In this paper, based on themechanism of geomagnetic storm invading long-distance buried pipeline, the equivalent circuit model of the pipeline is established using the Distributed Source Transmission Line (DSTL) theory. Then, considering the distance between the insulation joints, radius of the pipeline, coating resistivity, output current of potentiostat, the PSP distribution characteristics of hydrogen-electricity hybrid pipeline under geomagnetic storm is carried out. The interference law of geomagnetic storm on hydrogen-electricity hybrid pipeline is obtained. Finally, based on the simulation calculation, the optimal design method of hydrogen-electricity hybrid pipeline is acquired considering the geomagnetic interference.

AB Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes cartilage damage. Anti-inflammatories are widely used in the management of RA, but they can have side effects such as gastrointestinal and/or cardiovascular disorders. Studies published by our group showed that the synthesis of hybrid triazole analogs neolignan-celecoxib containing the substituent groups sulfonamide (L15) or carboxylic acid (L18) exhibited anti-inflammatory activity in an acute model of inflammation, inhibited expression of P-selectin related to platelet activation and did not induce gastric ulcer, minimizing the related side effects. In continuation, the present study evaluated the anti-inflammatory effects of these analogs in an experimental model of arthritis and on the functions of one of the important cells in this process, macrophages. Mechanical hyperalgesia, joint edema, leukocyte recruitment to the joint and damage to cartilage in experimental arthritis and cytotoxicity, spread of disease, phagocytic activity and nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide production by macrophages were evaluated. Pre-treatment with L15 and L18 reduced mechanical hyperalgesia, joint edema and the influx of leukocytes into the joint cavity after different periods of the stimulus. The histological evaluation of the joint showed that L15 and L18 reduced cartilage damage and there was no formation of rheumatoid pannus. Furthermore, L15 and L18 were non-cytotoxic. The analogs inhibited the spreading, the production of NO and hydrogen peroxide. L15 decreased the phagocytosis. Therefore, L15 and L18 may be potential therapeutic prototypes to treat chronic inflammatory diseases such as RA.

AB The paper presents a novel numerical approach to the quantitative estimation of the concentration limits for flame acceleration in hydrogen-based mixtures. A series of calculations are carried out for hydrogen-air and hydrogen-oxygen flames in channels. The analysis of the obtained numerical results provided the value of 11 +/- 0.25 % hydrogen content in the mixture as a lean concentration limit of flame acceleration that agrees well with the available experimental data. Moreover, the basic physical mechanism responsible for the transition from the steady mode of flame propagation to the accelerated one is distinguished. The mechanism is related to flame stretching in the region of interaction with the boundary layer and the competition between the joint increase in burning rate and heat losses. The novel technique for the estimation of concentration limits of flame acceleration presented here can be applied to assess combustion conditions inside combustors of energy and propulsion systems fed with hydrogen. The results are also useful in estimating explosion and fire risks in hydrogen storage, transport, and utilization facilities as parts of hydrogen energy and propulsion systems.

ID PREDICTION; BEHAVIOR
AB Design of a steel catenary riser requires the use of connection hardware to decouple the large bending moments induced by the host floater at the hang-off location. Reliability of this connection hardware is essential, particularly in applications involving high pressure and high temperature fluids. One option for this connection hardware is the metallic tapered stress joint. Titanium (Ti) Grade 29 has been identified as an attractive material candidate for demanding stress joint applications due to its "high strength, low weight, superior fatigue performance and innate corrosion resistance".(2) Titanium stress joints for deepwater applications are typically not fabricated as a single piece due to titanium ingot volume limitations, thus making an intermediate girth weld necessary to satisfy length requirements. As with steel, the potential effect of hydrogen embrittlement induced by cathodic and galvanic potentials must be assessed to ensure long-term weld integrity. This paper describes testing from a joint industry project (JIP) conducted to qualify titanium stress joint (TSJ) welds for ultra-deepwater applications under harsh service and environmental conditions. Corrosion fatigue crack growth rate (CFCGR) results for Ti Grade 29 flat welding-groove weld (1G/PA) gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) specimens in seawater under cathodic potential and sour brine under galvanic potential are presented and compared to vendor recommended design curves.

This study aimed to assess the efficacy of the sequential application of hydrogen peroxide, povidone-iodine, and physiological saline in reducing postoperative infections in TKA. Methods: The study prospectively included 4743 patients, with Group A (2371, 49.9%) receiving sequential intraoperative application of hydrogen peroxide, povidone-iodine, and physiological saline irrigation of the incision, and Group B (2372, 50.1%) receiving intraoperative application of physiological saline irrigation of the incision only, to collect the patients' baseline data and clinical characteristics, and to statistically assess the incidence of superficial infections and the PJI during the follow up period to evaluate the clinical value of the study. Results: The baseline levels of patients in Groups A and B were comparable. There were 132 (2.8%) lost visits during the study period. The incidence of superficial infections within 30 days after surgery was 0.22% in Group A and 1.17% in Group B, the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P = 0.007). The incidence of PJI was 0.17% in Group A and 1.26% in Group B, the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P = 0.0121). Conclusion: Sequential application of hydrogen peroxide, povidone-iodine, and physiological saline to irrigate incision in TKA can significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative superficial infections and PJI. The scientific and rational application of this therapy intraoperatively greatly reduces the incidence of PJI and postoperative superficial infections, which is of great benefit to the patient's prognosis.

ID RESIDUAL-STRESS
AB The hydrogen assisted cracking susceptibility of Modified 9Cr-1Mo steel weld is evaluated by implant test by determining lower critical stress for different preheating and combination of pre, post heating conditions. The diffusible hydrogen present in the implant specimens for different test conditions is estimated. Residual stress distribution in the weld for different heating condition is estimated using SYSWELD software. For a combination of pre + post heating at 200 degrees C, the diffusible hydrogen content of the weld comes down to 1.17 from 4.7 mL/100g and the lower critical stress of the implant specimen increases from 250 to 370 MPa. Preheating + post heating also brings down the peak tensile residual stress level in the weld joints and lowers the cracking susceptibility.

ID GAS SENSORS
AB The development of reliable hydrogen sensors is crucial for the safe use of hydrogen. One of the main concerns of end users is sensor reliability in the presence of species other than the target gas, which can lead to false alarms or undetected harmful situations. To assess the selectivity of commercial-off-the-shelf hydrogen sensors, a number of sensors of different technology types were exposed to various interferent gas species. Cross-sensitivity tests were performed in accordance with the recommendations of ISO 26142:2010, using the hydrogen sensor testing facilities of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the Joint Research Centre Institute for Energy and Transport. Most of the sensor platform tested are unaffected by the exposure to the interferents. The metal-oxide and the thermal conductivity platform show a remarkable sensitivity to CH4. None of the platforms tested were permanently affected by the exposure to the cross-sensitive species. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper examines some specific design issues associated with hydrogen transportation via pipelines based on recent field development study of high-throughput hydrogen pipelines. A mechanical design review is undertaken, and the current design practices and challenge are examined first. An array of key parameters considered to have significant bearing on the hydrogen pipeline general mechanical design are considered and assessed, including out of roundness (OOR) imperfections, combined stress and design factors, thermal gradients, joint mismatch and fabrication, fatigue assessment, installation, specifications and material consideration. Some of these are typically ignored for the conventional pipeline design, but open to rationalization for hydrogen charged pipeline systems subject to material embrittlement risk arising from hydrogen absorption. Complementary to the current design standards and as a spur to discussion on the hydrogen pipeline design analysis, special considerations and recommendations are proposed on materials specification, additional design criteria and construction assessments, and their rationale to mitigate material embrittlement with a view to improving hydrogen pipeline design, reliability and integrity management potentially leading to some tangible cost saving.

AB Martensitic 9% Cr steels like P91 and P92 can show an increased susceptibility to delayed hydrogen-assisted cracking. The focus of this study was the microstructure and heat treatment effect on the mechanical properties of P92 base material and P91 multi-layer weld metal in both as-welded and post weld heat treated (PWHT) condition. Tensile tests with hydrogen-free reference samples and electrochemically hydrogen charged samples were carried out; the mechanical properties were assessed and supported by detailed fractographic analysis. Finally, a hydrogen and microstructure-dependent fracture criterion is established. All investigated microstructures showed a hydrogen-influenced degradation of the mechanical properties compared to the hydrogen-free reference samples. The as-welded martensitic P91 weld metal had the highest degree of degradation in the presence of hydrogen. The P91 PWHT weld metal and the P92 base material had comparable properties. From that point of view, a significantly increased risk for hydrogen-assisted cold cracking during welding fabrication of P91 weld joints must be considered before any heat treatment is conducted.

AB Hydrogen permeation and slow strain rate tests in a high-pressure hydrogen-containing coal gas, combined with microstructural analysis, were conducted on X80 base metal, weld metal, and coarse-grained heat-affected zone (CGHAZ). Variation in the calculated diffusivity from high to low was in the following sequence: CGHAZ, weld metal, and base metal. This result was contrary to those of sub-surface hydrogen concentration and hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility. Hydrogen permeation in CGHAZ decreased the cross-sectional shrinkage by 34.56%, which indicates susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement. The co-effects of microstructure, hydrogen diffusivity, and concentration were the main factors that influenced hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID INDUCED CRACKING; MICROSTRUCTURE; FRACTURE; DIFFUSION
AB The hydrogen embrittlement behavior in terms of hydrogen-induced surface blistering and hydrogen-induced internal cracking of the friction stir welded high carbon steel plates was evaluated by the cathodic hydrogen charging method. The welding processes were performed at different revolutionary pitches of 0.83, 0.5, and 0.25 mm/rev and therefore, the stir zones of the welds had various microstructures accordingly. After hydrogen charging for 4 hours, the base metal showed large quantities of irreversible dome-shaped blisters on the sample surface. On the contrary, the blisters were hardly observed in the stir zone regardless of the welding parameters and only a small number of microcracks were formed. Compared with the base metal, the stir zones produced at 0.83 mm/rev and 0.5 mm/rev had less ductility reduction after hydrogen charging for the same time. It revealed that the stir zones showed higher resistance to hydrogen embrittlement than the base metal. However, the specimen welded at 0.25 mm/rev showed premature failure after hydrogen charging as a result of the formation of cracks in the twin martensite structure beneath the specimen surface.

AB Periprosthetic joint infection is a leading cause for failure of contemporary total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty projected to nearly double in the next decade and reach an economic burden of $1.85 billion in the United Sates by 2030. Although multiple treatments for periprosthetic joint infection have been described, a thorough de ' bridement and joint lavage to decrease bacterial bioburden and to remove biofilm remains a critical component of treatment. Various adjunct antiseptic agents such as chlorhexidine, povidone-iodine, hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, and chlorine compounds are currently in off-label use in this capacity. Each antiseptic agent, however, has a distinct mechanism of action and targets different organisms, and some combinations of agents may lead to tissue toxicity. In this review, currently available adjunct antiseptic washes will be described in detail based on their mechanism of action and the evidence for their use will be reviewed. Furthermore, this review puts forward an evidence-based treatment algorithm based on the specific causative organism.

AB The article describes the experimental studies of hydrogen (oxygen) generation processes by the electrolysis method that were fulfilled with the use of the energy plant model involving a solar energy photovoltaic converter (working surface area is of S = 1.5 m(2)) and a membrane-less high-pressure electrolyzer (capacity is of 0.002 m(3) of hydrogen per hour with an operating pressure of 0.3 MPa). Under experimental studies we have adjusted the modes of joint operating the photoelectric converter and the membrane-less high pressure electrolyzer depending on the changes of solar insolation. We have determined the ways to increase the electrolyzer efficiency. It was found that the level of current density, which determines the electrolyzer efficiency by hydrogen, depends on the solar insolation level.

AB Pyridoxal 50 -phosphate (PLP), the biologically active form of vitamin B6, is an essential cofactor in many biosynthetic pathways. The emergence of PLP-dependent enzymes as drug targets and biocatalysts, such as tryptophan synthase (TS), has underlined the demand to understand PLP-dependent catalysis and reaction specificity. The ability of neutron diffraction to resolve the positions of hydrogen atoms makes it an ideal technique to understand how the electrostatic environment and selective protonation of PLP regulates PLP-dependent activities. Facilitated by microgravity crystallization of TS with the Toledo Crystallization Box, we report the 2.1 A joint X-ray/neutron (XN) structure of TS with PLP in the internal aldimine form. Positions of hydrogens were directly determined in both the a- and 13 -active sites, including PLP cofactor. The joint XN structure thus provides insight into the selective protonation of the internal aldimine and the electrostatic environment of TS necessary to understand the overall catalytic mechanism.

AB Rock wettability and pore fluid properties are critical parameters for evaluating shale reservoirs, enhancing oil recovery, sequestering waste, and storing energy. Multiple petrophysical and geochemical experiments are routinely used to characterize these properties of shales. Two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)based shale evaluation methods usually rely on T1/T2 difference in various fluids. However, T1/T2 value is inadequate for petrophysical characterization due to the similar T1/T2 value of different hydrogen types in shales. A brand-new characteristic parameter, T1/T2 variation during a solvent extraction experiment, is proposed for the characterization of shale petrophysical properties. The theoretical ranges of T1/T2 variation for different hydrogen components were determined from the type and content changes of hydrogen during extraction based on surface relaxation model. Joint experiments of multi-step solvent extraction and NMR T1-T2 were designed to validate the theoretical results. Both theoretical and experimental results show that the heterogeneity of shale is responsible for the different hydrogen components with a similar T1/T2 value. The results of joint experiment (1) show that the T1/T2 variation ranges for different hydrogen components are different, and (2) indicate that T1/T2 variations can be used to quantitatively evaluate the hydrogen type and saturation. The experimentally determined ranges and patterns of T1/T2 variation are consistent with the theoretical results. The quantitative relationship between T1/T2 variation and saturation, mobility, or wettability was further determined based on the theoretical variation of correlation time. Finally, a new interpretation scheme was established for the quantitative evaluation of wettability and fluid properties based on T1/T2 variations.

AB In the framework of the HyTunnel-CS European project sponsored by Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (CH JU), a number of tests were conducted in a full-scale tunnel in France. These tests are devoted to safety of hydrogen-fuelled vehicles having a compressed gas storage. The goal of the study is to develop recommendations for Regulations, Codes and Standards (RCS) for inherently safer use of hydrogen vehicles in enclosed transportation systems. Two sets of tests have been performed, (a) five tests with compressed hydrogen tanks, (b) two tests with compressed helium tanks. The hydrogen gas pressure varied between 47 bar and 610 bar. The blast wave overpressures are recorded together with fireball characteristics. The obtained experimental data are compared to existing engineering correlations and it is confirmed that not only the mechanical energy of compressed gas but also a fraction of chemical energy contribute to the blast wave strength.

AB Methods of optical microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy have been used to study the structure of welded joints of a high-strength structural steel with different types of the weld metal. The impact toughness of the heat-affected zone (HAZ) has been determined at temperatures of +20 and -40A degrees C. Based on the fractograph investigations of the character of the fracture of the welded joints after tests for impact bending, the regions that are the most dangerous for crack initiation have been determined. Structural factors that affect the brittleness of the near-weld zone of welded joints with the austenite metal of the weld are indicated, including the existence of an austenite-bainite structure and coarse carbides, as well as the specific distribution of hydrogen.

AB Hydrogen energy applications often require that systems are used indoors (e.g., industrial trucks for materials handling in a warehouse facility, fuel cells located in a room, or hydrogen stored and distributed from a gas cabinet). It may also be necessary or desirable to locate some hydrogen system components/equipment inside indoor or outdoor enclosures for security or safety reasons, to isolate them from the end-user and the public, or from weather conditions.
   Using of hydrogen in confined environments requires detailed assessments of hazards and associated risks, including potential risk prevention and mitigation features. The release of hydrogen can potentially lead to the accumulation of hydrogen and the formation of a flammable hydrogen-air mixture, or can result in jet-fires. Within Hyindoor European Project, carried out for the EU Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking safety design guidelines and engineering tools have been developed to prevent and mitigate hazardous consequences of hydrogen release in confined environments. Three main areas are considered: Hydrogen release conditions and accumulation, vented deflagrations, jet fires and including under-ventilated flame regimes (e.g., extinguishment or oscillating flames and steady burns). Potential RCS recommendations are also identified. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrogen sulfide dissolved in aqueous electrolyte solutions causes susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking in most structural steels. This is one of the reasons for failure of the oil and gas field equipment and occurrence of the emergency situations. When transporting media containing hydrogen sulfide, most of the damage occurs in the welded joint area. In this study, the authors have established the influence of the microstructure of individual sections of the weld metal, its heat-affected zone, and the base metal on the corrosion resistance of a welded joint of a low-alloy pipe steel (grade X70) in the environment that mimics the operating conditions of the main oil and gas pipelines in the High North regions. The temperature fields and thermal cycles were calculated for submerged multi-arc welding in order to simulate the microstructure of the most problematic areas with the reduced level of mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. The method of controlled resistive heating and subsequent cooling was used to simulate the welding process. The simulation of the welding thermal cycle was performed using the Gleeble 3800 complex for physical simulation of thermomechanical processes. The results of sulfide stress cracking tests are presented. A metallographic analysis and microhardness measurements of the welded joint areas and base metal were carried out. It was shown that the microstructure of the overheated areas in the heat-affected zone is the part of the welded joint that is most susceptible to sulfide stress cracking. It has been established that studying just the welded joint and the base metal for susceptibility to corrosion cracking is insufficient in terms of assessing the reliability of a welded joint, which indicates the need to revise the testing procedure. In this study, samples of welded joints of thick-walled large-diameter pipes, including the base metal, heat-affected zone, and fusion zone, were studied. The areas that are most susceptible to the formation of corrosion cracks were determined and simulated.

AB We report the crystal structure of the anhydrous form of pranoprofen, a valuable non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, solved by direct space methodologies from synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction data. Through a detailed joint experimental and computational study we have explored the complex interplay of aromatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions present in the molecular arrangement of pranoprofen in the solid state. Cooperativity and reinforcement of pi-stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions govern the singular crystal packing of pranoprofen, suggesting potential binding mechanisms with biological targets.

ID PIPELINE STEEL; BEHAVIOR; PROTECTION; SUSCEPTIBILITY; HYDROGEN; JOINT
AB This study systematically investigates the electrochemical characteristics and stress corrosion cracking (SCC) susceptibility of distinct microstructural zones (base metal (BM), heat-affected zone (HAZ), and weld metal (WM)) in S420 steel welded joints under cathodic polarization potentials through combined electrochemical characterization and slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) testing. Results demonstrate that HAZ exhibits the highest corrosion current density among the three zones, indicating enhanced anodic dissolution and consequent SCC promotion. All zones display similar electrochemical responses to potential variations, with charge transfer resistance initially increasing then decreasing as polarization potential shifts negatively, peaking at -850 mV where anodic reactions dominate. SCC susceptibility progressively intensifies with cathodic polarization, transitioning from mixed anodic dissolution/weak hydrogen embrittlement (HE) at -750 mV to HE-dominated failure at -950 mV. The superior SCC susceptibility of HAZ is attributed to its coarser grain structure and abundant pearlite bands, yielding a hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility coefficient of 39.1 % at -850 mV - significantly higher than WM (19.3 %) and BM (16.0 %).

AB XOFs-type materials (X=M, C, S, that is, metal-organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks and supramolecular organic frameworks, respectively) share a common unifying feature: mutual spatial orientation of constituting components is strictly directional and unchanging by design. Herein, we illustrate an alternate design for porous architectures, as rigid joints constituted by coordinative (MOFs), covalent (COFs), or hydrogen-donor/acceptor (SOFs) bonds, are replaced by supramolecular ball joints, which confer unprecedented flexibility, especially angular, to porous networks. The obtained frameworks remain highly organized but are also permutable: lacking a forced convergence towards an immutable minimum energy structure, these systems remain able to adjust depending on external conditions. Results of POF (permutable organized framework) synthesis is a family of structures rather than a single pre-determined three-dimensional arrangement, as we demonstrate with an illustrative set of 5 XRD structures.

AB The joint consideration of hydrogen supply chain networks and electric power systems can promote hydrogen-fueled transportation and the penetration of renewable energy. This paper develops a low-carbon scheduling approach for an Integrated Hydrogen Transport and Energy System (IHTES). To reduce carbon emissions, the environmental cost from the hydrogen supply chain network and electric power system is jointly minimized with the operational cost of IHTES. To consider the timeliness of hydrogen deliveries, hydrogen transport via tube trailers is innovatively modeled as an extended vehicle routing problem with time windows, and delays are penalized. The scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem so that it can be efficiently solved using the branch-and-cut method. Case studies illustrate and validate the proposed model, and demonstrate the computational efficiency of our approach. Carbon emissions are reduced by 47.8% when the emission cost is co-optimized with the operational cost. The operational cost of the hydrogen supply chain network is reduced by 7.3% when the timeliness of hydrogen deliveries is modeled.(c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB In order to achieve carbon neutrality in a few decades, the clean energy proportion in power mix of China will significantly rise to over 90%. A consensus has been reached recently that it will be of great significance to promote hydrogen energy, that is produced by variable renewable energy power generation, as a mainstay energy form in view of its potential value on achieving carbon neutrality. This is because hydrogen energy is capable of complementing the power system and realizing further electrification, especially in the section that cannot be easily replaced by electric energy. Power system related planning model is commonly used for mid-term and long-term planning implemented through power installation and interconnection capacity expansion optimization. In consideration of the high importance of hydrogen and its close relationship with electricity, an inclusive perspective which contains both kinds of the foresaid energy is required to deal with planning problems. In this study, a joint model is established by coupling hydrogen energy model in the chronological operation power planning model to realize coordinated optimization on energy production, transportation and storage. By taking the carbon neutrality scenario of China as an example, the author applies this joint model to deploy a scheme research on power generation and hydrogen production, interregional energy transportation capacity, and hydrogen storage among various regions. Next, by taking the technology progress and cost decrease prediction uncertainty into account, the main technical- economic parameters are employed as variables to carry out sensitivity analysis research, with a hope that the quantitative calculation and results discussion could provide suggestion and reference to energy-related companies, policy-makers and institute researchers in formulating strategies on related energy development.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB In recent years, metal-thermoplastic polymer hybrid joints have been widely used in lightweight advanced aircraft and new energy vehicles. In this work, the method of machine milling + FeCl3 corrosion + coating KH892 was used to construct a viscous bionic villi structure on the surface of A2024 aluminum alloy, which greatly improved the interfacial bonding strength of a 30-wt.% glass fiber-reinforced PET-A2024 aluminum alloy joint (expressed as 30-wt.% GF/PET-A2024 joint). The synergistic action of the millimeter column produced by milling and the micron-scale porous structure produced by corrosion results in multiscale mechanical interlocking and increases the interfacial bonding strength of 30-wt.% GF/PET-A2024 to 44.2 MPa, which is 13.7 times greater than that of untreated joint. FTIR results show that the KH-892 coating can change the viscosity of the villi surface, which makes it easier for the bionic villi surface to bond with PET. Under the action of millimeter-micron multiscale mechanical interlocking and multiple hydrogen bonds, the interfacial bonding strength of 30-wt.% GF/PET-A2024 increases to 54.8 MPa.

AB Hydrogen fueling stations (HFSs) with onsite hydrogen production systems, which are usually composed of electrolyzers, hydrogen storage tanks and fuel cells, not only supply hydrogen for hydrogen-powered vehicles but also serve as a dispatchable technology that can bid in electricity markets. Except partici-pating in energy market, joining in reserve market can compensate the cost in energy market and in-crease the total revenue of HFS. This paper proposes a multi-stage stochastic programming model to find the optimal offering strategy of the HFS in energy, reserve markets taking into account a series of un-certainties: day-ahead price, secondary reserve price, system imbalance price and hydrogen demand. Nonanticipativity constraints are employed to guarantee the decisions are made according to the realized uncertainty information up to the present stage. Compared with traditional stochastic programming model, the proposed model adequately considers the sequential bidding decisions with the gradual revealing of the uncertainty over time. Numerical experiments based on one case study indicate that the participation of reserve market greatly increase the revenue of HFS. In addition, the proposed multi-stage stochastic programming model is effective in characterizing the sequential decision. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) following shoulder arthroplasty are a major source of morbidity and are most commonly caused by Cutibacterium acnes, a bacteria found concentrated in the dermis. Skin preparation using hydrogen peroxide has been shown to reduce positive cultures; however, direct application to the dermis has not been investigated. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the application of hydrogen peroxide to the dermis affects the incidence of positive C acnes cultures.
   Methods: A prospective, randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing primary shoulder arthroplasty by a single fellowship trained surgeon was performed between February and November 2020. Enrolled patients were randomized to either receive standard skin preparation and antibiotic prophylaxis with or without an additional application of hydrogen peroxide to the dermis following incision. Culture samples were taken from the skin, dermis, glenohumeral joint, and air. Laboratory personnel and patients were blinded to randomization, and all cultures were held for 14 days. Culture positivity rate along with culture site, day of culture positivity, and bacterial abundance of positive cultures were analyzed. Stratified analysis by gender and age of <69 years was also performed.
   Results: Sixty patients undergoing primary arthroplasty were randomized. The group receiving hydrogen peroxide (n = 30) and the control group (n = 30) were similar in age (71.1 +/- 7.1 vs. 73.4 +/- 9.8; P = .30), body mass index (29.4 +/- 5.7 vs. 28.5 +/- 6.0; P = .57), gender (P = .64), hand dominance (P = .65), and surgery type (P = .90). The overall rate of at least 1 positive culture was 18%. All positive cultures were C acnes. The positive culture rate in the hydrogen peroxide (20%) and control group were similar (16%; P > .99). There were no positive glenohumeral joint cultures and no wound complications. There was no significance difference in the culture site, day of culture positivity, and bacterial abundance. Stratification analysis by gender and age also demonstrated similar rates of C acnes between study groups.
   Conclusion: Standard skin preparation and antibiotic prophylaxis results in an overall low rate of skin and dermis culture positivity.

AB Hydrogen embrittlement of a precipitation-hardened Fe-26Mn-11Al-1.2C (wt.%) austenitic steel was examined by tensile testing under hydrogen charging and thermal desorption analysis. While the high strength of the alloy (>1 GPa) was not affected, hydrogen charging reduced the engineering tensile elongation from 44 to only 5%. Hydrogen-assisted cracking mechanisms were studied via the joint use of electron backscatter diffraction analysis and orientation-optimized electron channeling contrast imaging. The observed embrittlement was mainly due to two mechanisms, namely, grain boundary triple junction cracking and slip-localization-induced intergranular cracking along micro-voids formed on grain boundaries. Grain boundary triple junction cracking occurs preferentially, while the microscopically ductile slip-localization-induced intergranular cracking assists crack growth during plastic deformation resulting in macroscopic brittle fracture appearance.

AB Injection molded direct joining (IMDJ) is a promising metal-plastic direct joining method to make products lighter. IMDJ first treats the metal surface and then injects melted plastic onto the surface via injection insert molding. In this study, the chemical interaction between metal and plastic was discussed with aluminum plates whose surface textures and chemical conditions were carefully controlled. The different joining strengths for these different chemical conditioned plates indicated that the chemical interaction existed between aluminum and polyamide 6 (PA6). We characterized the joint interface with AFM-IR. The IR spectrums change indicated that -CONH in PA6 formed the hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl groups on the aluminum surface. The chemisorbed water on the surface was suspected to undermine the formation of the hydrogen bond. Our study showed that the hydrogen bond existed and contributed to the joining strength, which provided a better understanding of the joining mechanisms.

AB The joint microenvironment contributes significantly to arthritis by shaping the synovial sheath and inducing cartilage damage. Hydrogen has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential and shows promise in the treatment of arthritis, particularly in selectively reducing free radical levels while preserving normal cell redox reactions. However, the short retention time of hydrogen and its low solubility in body fluids pose challenges for its use to achieve an optimal therapeutic effect. Smart biomaterials respond to alterations in physiological parameters and external stimuli, enabling precise targeting and continuous local treatment, thus maintaining local H2 concentration at the treatment site. In this review, the recent advances in hydrogen-producing nanomaterials for the treatment of arthritis are presented and the challenges and prospects for their clinical application are evaluated.

In order to reduce the costs of wind power, the joint probability method is applied in the joint design of marine environmental elements. Based on copulas and univariate maximum entropy margins, multivariate maximum entropy distributions are constructed. Sample data of annual maximum significant wave height and corresponding wind speed and current velocity at Point 2 in Lianyungang Harbour of China is applied to testify the efficiency of trivariate maximum entropy distributions. The marginal fittings of univariate maximum entropy distributions and the trivariate data fitting based on normal copula fit the data well.

AB The hydrogen supply system is the high-pressure section of fuel cell system, consisting of many valves, pipelines and joints. A hydrogen leak may occur due to the reduced sealing performance or crash accidents. Therefore, a quick and accurate hydrogen leakage detection method is essential to support hydrogen safety. The traditional multisensor -based hydrogen leakage detection method directly classifies the hydrogen leakage fault according to the hydrogen concentration. However, using hydrogen concentrations at local points to describe leak fault severity has significant limitations. A novel hydrogen leakage detection method based on Stacking ensemble machine learning is proposed to classify hydrogen leak rate. The hydrogen leakage simulations are performed to form the database containing a series of hydrogen leakage scenarios. The sensor placement is optimized and the features extracted from hydrogen concentration time series are selected by applying ReliefF algorithm. The model -based hydrogen leakage detection method is analyzed and fused with proposed hydrogen leakage detection method based on Stacking ensemble machine learning by applying decisionlevel fusion algorithm. Compared with traditional multisensor -based hydrogen leakage detection method, the detection time of proposed multisensor -based hydrogen leakage detection method is shorter under nearly 80% of all scenarios. The classification accuracy of the proposed hydrogen leakage detection method based on Stacking ensemble machine learning and model -based hydrogen leakage detection method is 92.1% and 93.5%, respectively. The probability of class is increased and classification accuracy can be improved through D-S evidence theory.

AB Renewable hydrogen is a promising alternative to increase the presence of renewable energy in hard-to- decarbonize economic sectors. Renewable-fuel regulation standards have been formalizing to ensure that on-grid electrolytic production is primarily powered by renewable electricity. This work evaluates the mid- and long-term impact of integrating renewable hydrogen supply chains into the expansion and operation of the power system using a tailored modification of the open-source energy modeling system (OSeMOSYS). The model optimizes the joint expansion of the Chilean power system and a hydrogen supply chain for exports, between 2025 and 2060, under the European standard for renewable hydrogen. Results show that incorporating renewable hydrogen supply chains that comply with this standard impacts the infrastructure and operation of the power system during its transition towards decarbonization. Between 2025 and 2040, the off-grid hydrogen production scenario results in distributed production, requiring internal hydrogen transport and low grid reliance. Conversely, a scenario that assumes Power Purchase Agreements for renewable electricity results in centralized hydrogen production, with higher electricity transmission investments and grid reliance. For the scenarios studied, the average systemic cost of hydrogen production ranges from $2.9/kgH2 to $6.4/kgH2.

ID OPERATION
AB To address the increasing hydrogen demand and carbon emissions of industrial parks, this paper proposes an integrated energy system dispatch strategy considering multi-hydrogen supply and comprehensive demand response. This model adopts power-to-gas technology to produce green hydrogen, replacing a portion of gray hydrogen and incorporates a carbon capture system to effectively reduce the overall carbon emissions of the industrial park. Meanwhile, incentive-based and price-based demand response strategies are implemented to optimize the load curve. A scheduling model is established targeting the minimization of procurement, operation, carbon emission, and wind curtailment costs. The case study of a northern industrial park in China demonstrates that the joint supply of green and gray hydrogen reduces carbon emissions by 40.98% and costs by 17.93% compared to solely using gray hydrogen. The proposed approach successfully coordinates the economic and environmental performance of the integrated energy system. This study provides an effective scheduling strategy for industrial parks to accommodate high shares of renewables while meeting hydrogen needs and carbon reduction targets.

AB For our works, Mass Exchangers (MEs) are membrane equipment that exchange some component between two streams in a countercurrent arrangement. In previous works these were proposed to use them (with the goal of hydrogen recovery, energy saving and waste minimization) at different stages of the hierarchical decision procedure for process synthesis by Douglas: at an early design stage, when deciding the recycle structure of the process (resulting in considerable changes in the process structure); or at a final design stage, before deciding the mass and energy integrations of process streams (resulting in minor changes in the process structure).
   The heuristic allocation of MEs was used independently at both design stages in previous works, with the goal of comparing with other design alternatives reported in the literature that use membranes in the conventional configuration (one feed stream and two exit streams; retentate and permeate). In contrast, the present work compares the results of using MEs, when they are used individually at both design stages, and when they are used jointly at both design stages, in different configurations. For the case study example (the HDA Process), the use of a ME at an early design stage reduces the fresh hydrogen consumed by 3.37%, and the recycle compressor power by 4.09%. The use of a ME at a final design stage reduces the fresh hydrogen consumed by 31.64%, but it does not reduce the recycle compressor power. The joint use of the MEs at both design stages reduces the fresh hydrogen consumed by 14.54%, and the recycle compressor power by 2.91%.
   The joint use of MEs at both design stages retains the principal benefits of its use at early and final design stages (energy saving and hydrogen recovery, principally), so when both a reduction in the fresh hydrogen consumed and in the recycle compressor power is desired, it is the most appropriate option.

AB Hydrogen enrichment induced by pipeline welding residual stress is a key issue affecting the safe service of hydrogen pipelines. In order to explore the influence of welding residual stress on hydrogen diffusion and the effect of heat treatment, an X80 pipeline model with a six-layer girth weld was established using ABAQUS software, and coupling analysis of temperature field, stress field, and hydrogen diffusion was carried out. The distribution of residual stress in the welding area and local inclusion area was analyzed, the relationship between the hydrostatic stress and hydrogen diffusion of the pipeline, and the influence of the direction and shape of the inclusion on hydrogen diffusion were explored, and the effect of post-weld heat treatment on the residual stress and hydrogen diffusion in the welding area and local inclusion area was studied. The hydrostatic stress curve is similar to the hydrogen concentration distribution curve, and hydrostatic stress can be considered the main driving force for hydrogen diffusion in the pipeline. As the angle between the inclusions and the hydrogen diffusion direction increases, the hydrogen diffusion flux will gradually decrease. The more slender the inclusions, the stronger the diffusion ability of parallel or 45 & DEG; inclusions, and the weaker the diffusion ability of perpendicular inclusions. Hydrogen enrichment occurs in inclusions or inclusion boundaries before and after post-weld heat treatment of the pipeline, and the internal hydrogen concentration of hard inclusions is higher than that of soft inclusions. Post-weld heat treatment can significantly reduce welding residual stress and hydrostatic stress, thereby reducing hydrogen enrichment concentration.

AB Hydrogen is considered a key alternative to fossil fuels in the broader context of ecological transition. Repurposing natural gas pipelines for hydrogen transport is one of the challenges of this approach. However, hydrogen can diffuse into metallic lattices, leading to hydrogen embrittlement (HE). For this reason, typically ductile materials can experience unexpected brittle fractures, and it is therefore necessary to assess the HE propensity of the current pipeline network to ensure its fitness for hydrogen transport. This study examines the relationship between the microstructure of the circumferential weld joint in X52 pipeline steel and hydrogen concentration, introduced electrolytically. Base material, heat affected zone and fused zone were subjected to 1800, 3600, 7200 and 14400 s of continuous charging with a current density J = -10 mA/cm2 in an acid solution. Results showed that the fusion zone absorbed the most hydrogen across all charging times, while the base material absorbed more hydrogen than the heat-affected zone due to the presence of non-metallic inclusions. Fracture toughness was assessed using single edge notch tension specimens (SENT) in air and electrolytic hydrogen. Results indicate that the base material is particularly vulnerable to hydrogen environments, exhibiting the greatest reduction in toughness when exposed to hydrogen compared to air.

DE Carbon equilibrium; decarbonization; electrolytic hydrogen; integrated
   electricity-hydrogen system
ID POWER-TO-HYDROGEN; STORAGE
AB Global carbon emissions from electricity and hydrogen production have grown rapidly in recent years. Some existing literature has proposed the method of reducing carbon emissions by power-to-hydrogen (P2H) technology. However, due to the fossil-based energy structure of electricity system, excessive electricity to hydrogen may lead to an increase in carbon emissions. To reduce carbon emissions effectively, a low carbon-driven optimal capacity configuration method for P2Hs is proposed in this paper to explore carbon equilibrium in integrated electricity-hydrogen system. A joint economic dispatch model for integrated electricity-hydrogen system is formulated. The electricity system model is a security-constrained economic dispatch model with P2H constraints. The hydrogen system model is a hydrogen supply chain model with pipeline pack constraints and Weymouth equation, whose sources are fossil fuel reforming and electrolytic hydrogen. We propose a second-order cone programming (SOCP)-based solution to transform the hydrogen system model into a mixed integer second order cone programming (MISCOP), which can be readily solved by commercial solvers. To preserve the internal information of each system, a decentralized algorithm based on optimality condition decomposition (OCD) is developed. Case study based on modified IEEE 30-bus and Belgium 20-node integrated energy system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

AB Optical and electronic properties of ZnO doped with interstitial hydrogen were investigated using density functional theory approach. The stable position of H+ was determined in ZnO lattice. Hydrogen doping has increased the band gap of ZnO and shifted the Fermi level into the conduction band, revealing the so-called Burstein-Moss effect which is in consistent with some experimental results. Charge density calculation and Bader analysis showed that there is a strong bond between H and O while H doping intersects bond of Zn-O and increases charge of jointed oxygen, finally decreases volume of supercell. The optical calculations show that hydrogen incorporation, increases the optical band gap and plasma frequency, thus it shifts the absorption edge to lower wavelength, which leads to a blue shift.

AB Hydrogen therapy is an emerging and highly promising strategy for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases. However, nonpolarity and low solubility of hydrogen under the physiological conditions results in a limited therapeutic effect. Herein, we develop a biocompatible magnesium micromotor coated with hyaluronic acid as a hydrogen generator for precise rheumatoid arthritis management. The hydrogen bubbles generated locally not only function as a propellant for the motion but also function as the active ingredient for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation scavenging. Under ultrasound guidance, the micromotors are injected intra-articularly, and the dynamics of the micromotors can be visualized. By scavenging ROS and inflammation via active hydrogen, the oxidative stress is relieved and the levels of inflammation cytokines are reduced by our micromotors, showing prominent therapeutic efficacy in ameliorating joint damage and suppressing the overall arthritis severity toward a collagen-induced arthritis rat model. Therefore, our micromotors show great potential for the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis and further clinical transformation.

AB The joint effect of temperature and strain rate on hydrogen embrittlement properties of martensitic steel was investigated. At 50 & DEG;C, the elongation loss first increases and then, decreases with decreasing the strain rate. It was firstly reported that at the low strain rates, hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility was mitigated by temperature due to an increase in the hydrogen effusion to the surface of the material and the release of a significant amount of hydrogen before the yield point by temperature effect. At 25 & DEG;C, elongation loss increase with decreasing the strain rate, since in lower strain rates, the hydrogen can interact with mobile dislocations, which finally leads to H-induced fracture. The Kurdjumov-Sachs relationship between martensite and austenite was established, and prior austenite EBSD micrographs were obtained. The intergranular crack was observed which can be related to acting prior austenite grain boundaries as an H-induced crack path.

AB Hydrogen as compressed gas is a promising option for zero-emission fuel cell vehicle. The fast and efficient refueling of high pressure hydrogen can provide a convenient platform for fuel cell vehicles to compete with conventional gasoline vehicles. This paper reports the finding of adiabatic simulation of the refueling process for Type IV tank at nominal working pressure of 70 MPa with considering the station refueling conditions. The overall heat transfer involved in refueling process was investigated by heat capacity model based on MC method defined by SAE J2601. The simulation results are validated against experimental data of European Commission's Gas Tank Testing Facility at Joint Research Centre (GasTef JRC), Netherlands. The results confirmed that end temperature and state of charge significantly depends on refueling parameters mainly supply hydrogen temperature and filling rate.

AB This study investigates the microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of bare and Co coated AISI 441 ferritic stainless steel/YSZ ceramic reactive air brazed joints achieved by Ag-CuO braze for Solid Oxide Fuel/Electrolysis Cells applications. Interfacial microstructure of steel/YSZ joints is analyzed by SEM and TEM with EDS. A thick and porous oxide layer rich in Fe, Cr, and Cu is found in bare steel/YSZ ceramic joints, which is induced by the severe oxidation and its intense reaction with CuO during the brazing process. For the coated steel/YSZ ceramic joint, a comparably dense and uniform (Co, Fe, Cu)(3)O-4 spinel layer is formed on the steel surface, which is tightly bonded with Ag-CuO braze without visible bonding defects. Meanwhile, the oxidation of steel substrates and its interaction with CuO is significantly suppressed. Co coated steel/YSZ joints possess reliable mechanical properties with the shear strength of 51 MPa, which is 54.5% higher than that of bare steel/YSZ ceramic joints (33 MPa). Besides, the microstructure evolution of coated steel/YSZ ceramic joints during brazing is schematically illustrated by a physical model. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB Investigation results are presented to improve the structural strength (cold crocking resistance) of weld joints in high-strength steels with the yield limit over 600 MPa. The effect of arc, laser, and hybrid laser-arc welding conditions on the weld metal structure and diffusion hydrogen saturation of build-up and fused base metals was experimentally studied. The diffusion hydrogen saturation of build-up (arc and hybrid welding) and fused (laser welding) metals was chromatographically examined. In gas-shielded arc welding, the diffusion hydrogen content in the fused base metal was shown to be limited to the concentration that does not exceed 0.4 ml/100 g due to an increase in the welding speed from 18 to 50 m/h. In laser and hybrid laser-arc welding of high-strength steels with the yield limit over 600 MPa, the diffusion hydrogen content in the fused metal makes up 0.07 and 0.2-0.3 ml/100 g, respectively, regardless of the welding speed. The cold cracking resistance was evaluated by a commonly accepted procedure of special reference butt samples. Optical and transmission microscopic studies permitted of revealing the effect of arc, laser, and hybrid laser-arc welding conditions on the weld metal structure and gaining detailed information on the dislocation density distribution. The relation between the level of local internal stresses and the structural factors of dislocation density distribution in the weld metal was established. In arc and laser welding, local internal stresses were shown to be reduced to the values that do not exceed 0.22 of the theoretical metal strength if the welding speed would make up 50 m/h. In hybrid laser-arc welding at 72-110 m/h, maximum local internal stresses are also less than 0.22 of the theoretical metal strength. An increase in the cold cracking resistance in butt weld joints of high-strength 14KhGN2MD and N-A-XTRA-70 steels was established to be reached due to a low concentration of diffusion hydrogen in fused metal and formation of the fine-grained structure of lower bainite with the uniform dislocation density distribution.

AB We investigate the constraints on the reionization history of the Universe from a joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background and neutral hydrogen fraction data. The tanh parametrization and principal component analysis methods are applied to the reionization history respectively. The commonly used tanh parametrization is oversimplistic when the neutral hydrogen fraction data are taken into account. Using the principal component analysis method, the reconstructed reionization history is consistent with the neutral hydrogen fraction data. With the principal component analysis method, we reconstruct the neutral hydrogen fraction at z = 9.75 as x(HI) = 0.69(-0.30)(+0.32) for 6 < z < 20 range reconstruction, and x(HI) = 0.76(-0.22)(+0.27) for 6 < z < 30 range reconstruction. These results suggest that the Universe began to reionize at redshift no later than z = 10 at a 95% confidence level.

AB Polymer modification is a promising approach to improve the joining performance of injection molded direct joining (IMDJ) technology. However, the factors contributing to the improved joining strength of submicron scale surface pattern joints have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the mechanism for improving the joining performance of polyamide 6 (PA6)/aluminum alloy A5052 joints with Blast + hot water treated metal structure using a flow modifier (OSGOL MF-11). Enhanced mechanical polymer infiltration at the submicron scale was confirmed, and the hydrogen bond generation at the joint interface was characterized. These findings elucidate the reason for the joining performance improvement caused by the flow modifier in the submicron scale.

AB With growing concern about risks related to energy security around the world, the development of hydrogen cooperation between India and Japan has become very important to ensure the economic security of the two countries and to deepen economic cooperation. This report covers both public and private initiatives in the hydrogen area in both countries and visualizes the high potential and potential areas where both countries could cooperate in the hydrogen area, as well as the challenges that are necessary for cooperation. The following four factors are strong incentives for India and Japan to deepen cooperation in the hydrogen field: (1) India has a high potential hydrogen supply capacity, (2) India is very active in implementing hydrogen in society, (3) Japan is already conducting R&D in areas of high interest to India and (4) Japan will need to import hydrogen from other countries in the future. The issues of (1) cost visualization, including transportation costs, (2) harmonization of regulations, (3) harmonization of promotion measures between the two countries, (4) definition of "green hydrogen," and (5) protection of intellectual property are main challenges to be overcome. Thus, disclosures of necessary data for cost visualization of hydrogen transportation, further inter-governmental cooperations between India and Japan, and facilitation of the discussions on hydrogen among various stakes are key actions for materializing various joint hydrogen projects between both countries.

AB The effect of NaOH-containing fine water mist on hydrogen explosion flames is investigated utilizing numerical simulations using a multi-step model of the chemical reaction mechanism. The suppression effect of hydrogen explosion fine water mist in different pipes is studied. The chemical agent NaOH is introduced into the water mist, and the inhibition mechanism is studied from a microscopic perspective. The results show that the addition of fine water mist can effectively reduce the flame temperature and that the fine water mist completely evaporates and absorbs heat in the preheating zone. The addition of NaOH can improve the inhibition effect of ultrafine water mist on hydrogen explosion, which is the result of the joint action of physical inhibition and chemical inhibition. The mole fraction curve shows that NaOH delays the reaction process of hydrogen explosion by trapping high-energy free radicals.

AB Green hydrogen is a potential contributor to a more sustainable transportation system. In this paper, we present our experiences and insights gained from an industrial-scale green hydrogen refilling station, marked by the innovative hybrid Edge-Cloud electrolyser system (EMS) employed in this context. Hybrid EMS can improve system performance, adapt to dynamic conditions, and continuously improve efficiency, even under unpredictable load and low storage situations. It also allows the centralized monitoring of future hydrogen production sites to facilitate the operation and maintenance and, in the long-term vision, to enable the joint coordination of the plants flexibilities in the service market as a virtual plant, thus increasing the cost efficiency. Through a real-time digital-model based assessment of the EMS, this study offers valuable lessons learned and findings, contributing to a deeper understanding of EMS in green hydrogen infrastructure.

AB Road transportation is a significant source of CO2 emissions and energy demand. Conse-quently, initiatives are being promoted to decrease the sector's emissions and comply with the Paris agreement. This article synthesizes the available information about heavy-duty fuel cell trucks as their deployment needs to be considered a complementary solution to decreasing CO2 emissions alongside battery electric vehicles. A thorough evaluation of 95 relevant documents determines that the main research topics in the past ten years converge on public policies, hydrogen supply chain, environmental impact, drivetrain technology, fuel cell, and storage tank applications. The identified research gaps relate to expanding collaboration between institutions and governments in developing joint green macro policies focused on hydrogen heavy-duty trucks, scarce research about hydrogen production energy sources, low interest in documenting hydrogen pilot projects, and minimal involvement of logistic companies, which need to plan their diesel freight's conversion as soon as possible.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB Novel microporous activated carbon (MAC) with high surface area and pore volume has been synthesized by microwave heating. Iron oxide nanoparticles were loaded into MAC by using Fe(NO3)(3)center dot 9H(2)O followed by microwave irradiation for up to five minutes. The surface modified microporous activated carbon was characterized by BET, XRD, SEM and thermogravimetric examinations. Adsorption data of H-2 on the unmodified and modified MACs were collected with PCT method for a pressure range up to 120 bar at 303 K. Greater hydrogen adsorption was observed on the carbon adsorbents doped with 1.45 wt% of iron oxide nanoparticle loaded due to the joint properties of hydrogen adsorption on the carbon surface and the spill-over of hydrogen molecules into carbon structures.

AB The synergistic effects of Nd and Ga on the microstructure and mechanical properties of ER4047 alloy wires and the resulting MIG(Melt inert-gas welding) joints were investigated. Experimental results show that the hydrogen content in the liquid and solid alloy decreases rapidly and then increases slowly with the addition of Nd in the range of 0-0.8 wt.%. Under the same conditions, the hydrogen content ratio in the solid and liquid is between 1.9 and 2.1. After adding 0.08-0.2 wt.% Nd, the alpha-Al dendrites and eutectic Si phases in the ER4047 alloys are refined and modified, respectively; the quality index of the cast rod increases and the weld percent porosity of the MIG joint significantly decreases. However, when 0.8 wt.% Nd is added, although the size of the eutectic Si phase reaches a minimum value, a large number of coarse needle-like Nd-rich phases precipitate in the structure. Moreover, Ga inhibits the precipitation of the Nd-rich phases, thus improving the mechanical properties, especially the elongation of the cast rod. When 0.2 wt.% Nd and 0.05 wt.% Ga are added into the alloy wire, the porosity of the MIG joint reaches the lowest value herein, and the tensile strength and face/back bending angles reach their maximum values.

AB Surgical site infections (SSIs) and prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) remain significant challenges in orthopedic surgery, particularly in joint arthroplasty. Intraoperative irrigation is a widely used strategy for infection prevention, yet traditional solutions such as saline, povidone-iodine, hydrogen peroxide, and sodium hypochlorite are limited by cytotoxicity, short antimicrobial duration, and poor biofilm penetration. This review evaluates commonly used irrigation agents and highlights the growing evidence supporting a novel citrate-based solution as a potentially superior alternative. These agents combine broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, effective biofilm disruption through ionic chelation, and prolonged postoperative protection with minimal harm to host tissues. Early clinical studies and ongoing randomized trials have demonstrated promising results, including reductions in postoperative swelling, opioid use, and infection rates. As more data become available, citrate-based solutions may emerge as the preferred standard for intraoperative irrigation in orthopedic procedures.

AB Gas-geochemical studies of the methane, helium, and hydrogen concentrations in the water of thermal and mineral springs, as well as the subsurface atmosphere, of northern Vietnam showed that the region is in the hypabyssal degassing zone of hydrogen and helium flowing to the surface through a fault system in the Earth's crust. A joint transit of these gases through the fault structures was established. Distribution pattern of hydrogen and helium concentrations in the Red River Rift area (northern Vietnam) was obtained from the extensive gas and water sample data. Intense linear anomalies are associated with the Red River Rift and the Dien Bien regional rift. Seismic events are associated with the fault, and earthquake epicenters are located in the Dien Bien Province.

AB It has been established that the noble-metal-H analogue has been found in a large number of noble-metal-ligand clusters in view of geometric and electronic structures. Here, we demonstrated a different view of noble-metal-H analogue between noble-metal and hydrogen in M(SCH3)(2)(-) (M = Cu, Ag, Au and H) systems. Although H(SCH3)(2)(-) is a typical ion-hydrogen bonding cluster dramatically different from the chemical bonding clusters of M(SCH3)(2)(-) (M = Cu, Ag and Au), the comparison of the two typical bonding patterns has not yet been fully investigated. Through a series of chemical bonding analyses, it is indicated that the evolution has been exhibited from typical ionic bonding in Cu(SCH3)(2)(-) to a significant covalent bonding nature in Au(SCH3)(2)(-) and hydrogen bonding dominating in H(SCH3)(2)(-). The comparison of M(SCH3)(2)(-) (M = Cu, Ag and Au) with H(SCH3)(2)(-) illustrates the differences in bonding between noble metals and hydrogen, which are mainly related to their diverse atomic orbitals participating in chemical bonding.

ID MICROSTRUCTURE
AB High silicon aluminum alloy is a kind of high-performance electronic packaging material, due to its excellent thermal conductivity, low thermal expansion coefficient, and low density. The heat affected zone (HAZ) of conventional welding techniques is too wide to weld the high silicon aluminum alloy, as wide HAZ will improve risk of cracking. Laser welding with narrow HAZ, high joint strength, and good morphology, has been considered as a promising method to weld high silicon aluminum alloy. Herein, the surface morphology, microstructure, and microhardness of laser welding joint between Al-50wt.%Si and Al-27wt.%Si alloys were investigated. It has been found that welding speed at 3 mm-5 mm/min can significantly reduce the hydrogen pores and cracks in laser welding joints. Also, the key paraments of laser welding to control the quality of joints are power and pulse width, while the former one is mainly controlling the joint width and the latter one is significantly changing the joint depth. Along the horizontal direction of laser welding joints, the microhardness increases firstly and then decreases, with the highest microhardness of 167 HV in the weld zone. Because the laser welding method could produce uniform microstructure of joints, the microhardness of joints is uniform along the longitudinal direction. The tensile properties of welding samples are almost the same with the properties of the Al-50wt.%Si base materials.

AB Background: The prevention and treatment of periprosthetic joint infection is of utmost importance to orthopedic surgeons. Irrigation solutions have become a popular additive to the prevention and treat-ment armamentarium. Methods: This symposium summarizes the mechanism of action, basic science, and clinical research to date on the use of irrigation solutions. The four most commonly used irrigation solutions, povidone iodine, chlorhexidine, hydrogen peroxide, and acetic acid, are discussed. In addition, the role of antibiotic powers is reviewed. Results: Each solution has its risks and benefits that must be weighed by the surgeon. There is no clear irrigation solution that is superior. The role of additive antibiotic powder (vancomycin) remains controversial. Conclusion: More rigorous prospective clinical trials are needed to determine the optimal irrigation solution for the prevention and treatment of periprosthetic joint infection.

The lap-shear testing results show that a mixed failure dominated by adhesive failure occurred in both unexposed and exposed adhesive-bonded AA5052 joints. The lap-shear strength of adhesive-bonded AA5052 joints declined sharply in the preliminary stage of NSS exposure (e.g. shorter than 240 hours), then it decreased moderately as the NSS exposure time increased. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and electrochemical noise measurement were applied to exploring the degradation mechanisms of the lap-shear strength of adhesive-bonded AA5052 joints. The adhesive properties remained nearly unchanged after exposure in the NSS environment. The decreased hydrogen bond at the AA5052/adhesive interface was responsible for the sharp degradation of the lap-shear strength of adhesive-bonded AA5052 joints in the preliminary stage of NSS exposure. In the later stage of NSS exposure (e.g. more than 240 hours), the surface oxidation of AA5052 substrates dominated the lap-shear strength degradation of adhesive-bonded AA5052 joints.

AB In the present investigation, the electrochemical behavior of dissimilar welds between austenitic stainless steel and low-carbon steel obtained by resistance spot welding was investigated. The results obtained showed the formation of martensite in the fusion zone produced elevated hardness values (similar to 480 HV) and was detrimental to the corrosion resistance of the material in acid media (0.5M H2SO4 containing naturally dissolved O-2). The susceptibility of the welded joints to hydrogen embrittlement was studied by applying cathodic charging in acid solution, which led to a 42 +/- 5% reduction in maximum elongation compared to noncharged specimens.

AB The effects of the formation of hydrogen-bonded networks on the important osmolyte trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) are explored in a joint Raman spectroscopic and electronic structure theory study. Spectral shifts in the experimental Raman spectra of TMAO and deuterated TMAO microsolvated with water, methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol are compared with the results of electronic structure calculations on explicit hydrogen-bonded molecular clusters. Very good agreement between experiment and theory suggests that it is the local hydrogen-bonded geometry at TMAO's oxygen atom that dominates the structure of the extended hydrogen-bonded networks and that TMAO's unique stabilizing abilities are a result of the "indirect effect" model. Natural bonding orbital (NBO) calculations further reveal that hyperconjugation results in vibrational blue shifts in TMAO's C H stretching region when solvated and a red shift in methanol's C-H stretching region when hydrogen bonding with TMAO.

AB A reduction in greenhouse gases has become an inescapable requirement. An effective scenario for achieving carbon neutrality is to develop a hydrogen economy. Its success, however, requires strict control of the different processes involved in planned hydrogen chains. The energy chain considered in this paper is a stationary application which involves the production of hydrogen by electrolysis (a power-to gas process) and its combustion in gas turbine combined cycles to generate electricity (a gas-to-power process). In such applications, the need is twofold: (i) to control the risk of explosive atmospheres by performing safe gas detection in the presence of hydrogen and (ii) to secure the reliability of all chain processes using hydrogen-rich gases by achieving reliable analyses of these gases. This paper is dedicated to the development of hydrogen energy to decarbonize the thermal production of electricity. We will first describe the hydrogen chain that would best suit the power generation sector. Then, we will highlight the properties of hydrogen that are critical for its reliable operation. Finally, we will review the sensing technologies suitable for hydrogen-containing fuels. This review paper was published as part of a Joint Industrial Project (JIP) aimed at enabling the safe and reliable deployment of hydrogen energy.

AB Compared to the conventional hydrogen bonds, nonconventional hydrogen bonds have gained increasing interest in recent years. In this work, we firstly investigate hydrogen bonds in mixed-solvent Au-(CH3OH)(H2O) complex via gas phase anion photoelectron velocity map imaging associated with quantum chemical calculations. The vertical detachment energy of Au-(CH3OH)(H2O) complex is determined as 3.22 +/- 0.02 eV. The calculations reveal these mixed-solvent solvated complexes having two stable low-energy isomers: Iso-a and Iso-b. And the experimental spectrum is ascribed to the contribution from Iso-a isomer. Detailed hydrogen bonding patterns have been revealed for both isomers.

AB X52 pipeline steel has been widely used for long-distance transmission for oil and gas, there is a lack of evaluation of such pipelines steel in service. Thus, the present work mainly focuses on the effect of cathodic protection potential on stress corrosion cracking (SCC) behavior of a in service for 20 years X52 pipeline steel. The SCC behavior was systematically studied by electrochemical method, slow strain rate tension (SSRT), and surface analysis techniques in near-neutral NS4 solution. The results show that the SCC mechanism of base metal (weld joint) belongs to the anodic dissolution, anodic dissolution + hydrogen embrittlement, and hydrogen embrittlement when the E-app is - 664 mV (- 738 mV), - 664-- 872 mV (- 738-- 980 mV), and < - 872 mV (- 980 mV), respectively. The SCC susceptibility of base metal and weld joint gradually increases with the negative potential application and then increases sharply when the potential is negative than - 1100 mV. The fracture morphology also changes with the E-app and gradually becomes cleavage fracture with the negative shift of potential.

AB This study examines the microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of A500 bulletproof steel joints welded with austenitic stainless steel (ER371) and ferritic (T91) filler materials. While austenitic fillers are traditionally used in bulletproof steel welding to prevent cracking and hydrogen embrittlement, their lower hardness creates a potential weakness in welded joints. This research explores an alternative approach using a newly developed ferritic filler material to achieve strength matching with the base material. Detailed microstructural characterization was conducted using Optical Microscopy (OM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), while mechanical properties were evaluated through tensile testing, impact testing, and hardness measurements. The results revealed significantly different mechanical behaviors between the two filler materials, with the ferritic filler achieving superior weld metal hardness (470 HV1) compared to the austenitic filler (185 HV1) in WZ. The fine-grained heat-affected zone (FGHAZ) exhibited the highest hardness (518 HV1) in A500-T91 joints and (480 HV1) in A500-ER371 joints, while ballistic testing demonstrated enhanced penetration resistance with the ferritic filler material.

AB Given the high sensitivity of hydrogen porosity in the welding process of AlSi10Mg aluminum alloy formed by selective laser melting, the effect of dehydrogenation treatment on the pore defects of alloy laser welded joints was analyzed by solid solution dehydrogenation and vacuum solid solution dehydrogenation methods under different states as well as the pore distribution, microstructure evolution, and mechanical behavior of laser welded seam. The results show that the solution treatment can effectively reduce the porosity of AlSi10Mg aluminum alloy laser welded seam formed by selective laser melting. Vacuum solution treatment has the best effect, which reduces the porosity from 2.646% of the deposited state laser welding seam to 0.14%. The reasons for the appearance of pores were explained by analyzing the evolution of the joint structure and change in the phase morphology and composition of the substrate. It is revealed that vacuum heat treatment is an effective method to solve the problem of pore formation in the weld due to the high content of hydrogen pre-existing in the substrate. After solid solution, the hardness of the base metal decreases significantly, and the average hardness (HV) of the welds of each test plate is 784 MPa, which is relatively consistent. The tensile strength of the welded joint of the solid solution test plate is 143 MPa, which is lower than that of the deposited joint, but the elongation increases to 24%, showing characteristic of ductile fracture.

AB In recent years, a large and growing number of companies have attempted to develop core technologies for their products by conducting joint research with a company in a different industry. However, the mechanisms by which technologies are acquired and assimilated through cross-industry research remains unclear. In response to this ambiguity, we developed a theoretical framework for this mechanism, proposed hypotheses, and empirically examined data from a joint research project conducted by Toyota Motor Corporation and Panasonic Corporation to develop the nickel-hydrogen storage cell. Specifically, we analysed networks of inventors who filed patent applications through the joint research. The results indicate that there are 'boundary mediators' who facilitated the exchange of technologies between the two companies. On the basis of their wide range of technical knowledge, we found there to be two types of boundary mediators.

AB The characteristics of electrolyte wetting and gas release are of vital importance for the electrocatalytic activity of a hydrogen evolution electrode (HEE). Herein, we reported a strategy to synergistically optimize the electrolyte wetting and gas release of a HEE to enhance its electrocatalytic activity. In our work, Pt nanosheets arrays were electrochemically deposited on a conductive substrate of Au microgrid to form a HEE. The micropores of Au grids induced discontinuous solid/liquid two-phase contact lines in microscale, which facilitated the wetting of proton-contained electrolyte. Simultaneously, the superaerophobicity of HEE promoted the release of hydrogen gas products. The joint improvement on electrolyte wetting and gas release enhanced the current density of hydrogen evolution reaction at a high overpotential by similar to 300 % when compared with Pt nanosheets arrays on a flat Au substrate.

AB The stress corrosion behavior of 7085-T7452 high-strength aluminum alloy base material (BM) and its friction stir welding (FSW) joints under varying strain rates during slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) was investigated. The results show that the stress corrosion sensitivity (ISSRT) of both the BM and FSW joints decreases with the increase of strain rate from 10-7 s- 1 to 10-5 s- 1. Moreover, the BM demonstrates lower ISSRT than the joints. The cracks in the joints exhibit dendritic paths along grain boundaries, with evidence of crack arrest marking (CAM) at localized areas in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution, suggesting both anodic dissolution and hydrogen-induced cracking simultaneously govern the propagation of stress corrosion cracks. There is the forced more test time in the slower strain rate, and the accumulation of stress corrosion coupling damage accelerates with the time, eventually leading to the greater degradation in the stress corrosion resistance and the higher ISSRT.

AB Fatigue tests of cruciform welded joints made of Q355B steel at very-high-cycle fatigue (VHCF) regimes were carried out on as-welded specimens using high frequency mechanical impact (HFMI) treatment in dry air and water-spray environments, respectively. The influence of the environment on fatigue life was more obvious in the VHCF regime. It was found that S-N curves became flat over the range of 10(6)-10(8) cycles for as-welded specimens, while a continuously decreasing S-N curve existed for HFMI-treated specimens. Fatigue cracks initiated from the weld toe of the as-welded specimens in dry air and water-spray environments. Due to residual stress, the crack initiation site transition of HFMI-treated specimens from the weld toe to the weld root and base metal was observed at lower stress levels. Moreover, hydrogen-assisted quasi-cleavage and intergranular fracture were captured using a scanning electron microscope and a hydrogen permeation test.

AB Using fiber laser welding technology, X80 pipeline steel welded joints with different welding heat inputs were obtained. Their microstructure, mechanical properties, and corrosion resistance (in NACEA solution saturated with hydrogen sulfide) were studied. Findings indicated that with the increase in heat input, the proportion of ferrite, strength, elongation, and corrosion resistance increased within a certain range and the sum of the proportion of martensite and bainite and hardness decreased. The heat input has a greater effect on the microstructure of weld metal (WM) and coarse-grained heat-affected zone (CGHAZ), while that of fine-grained heat-affected zone (FGHAZ) is basically unchanged. Obvious differences are also found in the corrosion resistance of different regions of the welded joints, among which FGHAZ has the strongest corrosion resistance, followed by WM and CGHAZ. The heat input mainly affects the microstructure type of the welded joint to affect the corrosion resistance. Therefore, we model the heat input as a function of R-ct and i(corr) from this relationship. In addition, the corrosion products film produced by the long-term immersion of the welded joint in the saturated H2S NACEA solution can hinder the development of corrosion and enhance the corrosion resistance to a certain extent.

AB The equipment of RH600 Hydrogen Analyzer (Fusion) was adopted to measure the hydrogen content of Nb47Ti alloy bars, with Phi 50 mm X 40 mm after different annealing processes in RX-460 electric furnace. Based on the analysis results, a dehydrogenation method was proposed. The results indicate that the main hydrogenation takes place at the annealing temperature of 1200 degrees C, while the hydrogenation can not occur in the subsequent annealing at 950, 930 and 900 degrees C. The hydrogenation phenomenon occurring in Nb47Ti alloy is mainly attributed to the joint effect of the high activity constituent elements and the rare hydrogen atmosphere. The 800 degrees C/3 h and 800 degrees C/6 h vacuum heat treatment can reduce the hydrogen content in Nb47Ti alloy effectively from 60 mu g/g to 21 and 29 mu g/g, respectively.

AB The present study deals with the effects of high temperature expositions and subsequent cathodic hydrogen charging of dissimilar martensitic/bainitic weldment on its local mechanical properties and fracture behaviour at room temperature. Circumferential welded joint under investigation was produced by tungsten inert gas welding of X10CrWMoVNb9-2 martensitic and 7CrMoVTiB10-10 bainitic steels tubes with Ni-based filler metal and the application of subcritical postweld heat treatment. Hardness profile measurements revealed pronounced hardness peaks in over-heated regions of the individual steels heat-affected zones which remained preserved also during subsequent expositions at 600 degrees C for up to 5000 hours. Gradual microstructural degradation of these regions included precipitate coarsening and the formation of new secondary phases during thermal exposure. The combined effects of thermal and hydrogen embrittlement of the studied weldment resulted in deleterious effects on its tensile and fracture behaviour.

ID ENERGY SYSTEM
AB The proliferation of hydrogen fueling stations as a critical infrastructure is necessary for the successful materialization of hydrogen-powered vehicles. Such fueling stations can, in part, utilize the renewable/inexpensive electricity, which would otherwise be curtailed, to generate and store hydrogen. The stored hydrogen can later be used to serve the transportation sector and straightforwardly yield profit for the operator of the stations. The available energy in the storage stations, however, would not be utilized effectively during offpeak hydrogen demand by the transportation sector. While hydrogen fueling stations are primarily contemplated as the suppliers to hydrogen vehicles, this paper shows how the storage capacity in each station can be exploited to provide operating reserve (OR) to an electricity market. To that end, this paper proposes a new supervisory-based model for the optimal scheduling of distributed hydrogen storage stations for 1) energy supply to hydrogen-powered vehicles; and 2) OR provision to an electricity market. As such, the economic feasibility of the investment in such stations would be further intensified due to extra financial settlements for the stations via joint applications. This paper, then, unveils a model that brings about more opportunities for the deployment of hydrogen fueling stations, thereby further inspiring the private investment in such an area by private sectors. The efficacy and feasibility of the proposed model are validated using numerical illustration conducted on a test system.

AB The effects of height reductions and microstructure inhomogeneity on hot deformation behavior of the hydrogenated 0.21 wt.%H Ti-0.3Mo-0.8Ni alloy welded joints were investigated. The hydrogen-induced evolution mechanisms of flow stress were discussed. The results show that fully lamellar microstructures were stretched or bent with increasing height reductions, the inhomogeneity had no significant effect on microstructure evolution at a small height reduction. The hydrides had occurred local fracture and a large angle bending at height reduction of 60%. The morphology of DRX grains tended to change from approximate equiaxed to large lamellar with increasing hydrogen content to the 0.21 wt.%H. Flow stress decreased significantly with increasing hydrogen content, but height reduction had a limited effect on flow stress evolution. Flow stress of the hydrogenated 0.21 wt.%H weld zone was larger than that of base metal at height reduction of 60%, the 0.21 wt.%H could not significantly improve hot working performance of the weld zone. The hydrogen-induced dynamic recrystallization of alpha lamellas and improved dislocation movement resulted in the rapid reduction of flow stress with the 0.21 wt.%H. The limited increase of beta phase and local stress concentration also finitely led to a slight decrease of flow stress.

AB Nickel yttria-stabilized zirconia cermet anode (Ni-YSZ)/interconnect joints with silver palladium gallium (Ag-9Pd-9Ga) active fillers are prepared by vacuum brazing. The joint structure and microstructure are analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEWEDS), and by using an electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA). SEM observations of the joint show no cracks near the interface, confirming the compatibility of the Ag-9Pd-9Ga filler with a different anode and interconnect. The XRD pattern of the joint specimens oxidized at 800 degrees C for 250 h shows Cr2O3 and (Mn,Cr)(3)O-4 surface layers. EPMA analysis of the cell/Ag-9Pd-9Ga/alloys joint at the cross section shows Cr, O, Fe, Zr, Ni, Ag, Pd, Ga, Y, and Mn. Overall, the results indicate that the bonding between metal and cermet is well established and the interface is smooth. By correlating the XRD and EPMA analysis results, we also analyzed the possible stages during joint oxidation. The joint strength was evaluated at 25 and 800 degrees C under shear and tensile loading conditions, respectively, and the brazed Ag-9Pd-9Ga sealant compared favorably with the commercially available glass-ceramic GC-9 counterpart.

AB This paper summarises the first results from the joint industry project (JIP) 'Risk-reduction for hydrogen installations by partial suppression of explosions' (HyRISE). The main objective of the project is to develop fundamental knowledge that can support the development of practical solutions for mitigating hydrogen explosions in congested and confined environments by means of active systems for chemical inhibition. The aim is not to extinguish the incipient flame, but rather to lower the reactivity of the fuel-air mixture prior to ignition, and thereby reduce the consequences of an accidental explosion to a tolerable level. The paper consists of three parts: a review of previous work on chemical inhibition of premixed hydrogen-air flames, simulations with the chemical kinetics software Cantera, and experiments conducted in a 20-litre explosion vessel. The results demonstrate that chemical inhibition can be effective for hydrogen-air mixtures. However, it remains to develop efficient inhibitors and practical systems that can be implemented in industrial facilities, with satisfactory performance over a wide range of hydrogen concentrations.

AB High-nitrogen austenitic stainless steel (HNASS) has many excellent properties, such as high strength and toughness, high strain-hardening ability, strong corrosion resistance and low magnetization compared with the traditional widely used Ni-Cr austenitic stainless steel. The high nitrogen content in HNASS leads to the welded joint in the risk of many problems, such as nitrogen escape and loss, nitride precipitation, formation of pores and thermal cracks, resulting in the poor welding performance. The HNASS joints without obvious defects were obtained by metal inert gas (MIG) welding and laser-MIG hybrid welding, separately. The microstructures and properties of welded joints were compared. The nitrogen content in fusion zones of the two joints was tested by an oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen analyzer. The tensile strength and the impact absorption energy of laser-MIG hybrid welded joint were about 27% and 20% higher than those of MIG welded joint, respectively. It could be attributed to the stronger solid solution strengthening effect resulted by the high nitrogen content of laser-MIG hybrid welded joint. The finer grains and the reduction of ferrite and precipitation phase in the microstructure of laser-MIG hybrid welded joint contributed to the improvement of toughness. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB The increasing penetration of renewable and distributed resources signals a global boom in energy transition, but traditional grid utilities have yet to share in much of the triumph at the current stage. Higher grid management costs, lower electricity prices, fewer customers, and other challenges have emerged along the path toward renewable energy, but many more opportunities await to be seized. Most importantly, there are insufficient studies on how grid utilities can thrive within the hydrogen economy. Through a case study on the State Grid Corporation of China, we identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of grid utilities within the hydrogen economy. Based on these factors, we recommend that grids integrate hydrogen into the energy-as-a-service model and deliver it to industrial customers who are under decarbonization pressure. We also recommend that grid utilities fund a joint venture with pipeline companies to optimize electricity and hydrogen transmissions simultaneously.

AB The presence of microstructural heterogeneity within welded joints, combined with environmental factors, can have detrimental effects on the service life of engineering structural components. This study explores the effect of hydrogen/methane (H2/CH4) gas mixture under various volume fractions of hydrogen on the deformation and fracture behavior of a welded API X70 pipeline material employing the small punch test method. The welded metal showed more vulnerable to hydrogen-assisted fracture in comparison to the base metal, as evinced by a notable reduction in the volume fraction of hydrogen required for the transition from ductile to brittle behavior. The hydrogen embrittlement indexes obtained through the small punch test method are more severe than those obtained through conventional test methods. The direct utilization of small punch test results for the assessment of hydrogen compatibility in structural materials may yield overly conservative estimations. Quantitative parameters derived from the small punch test of both materials, along with fracture morphologies, were analyzed to establish a correlation between the hydrogen embrittlement indexes obtained through the small punch test and those obtained through conventional test methods. The small punch test method appears capable of detecting hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity resulting from adverse microstructural features existing in the metal matrix.

AB This paper proposes a systematic optimization framework to jointly determine the optimal location and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage in a power network to achieve the transition to lowcarbon networks efficiently. We obtain these strategic decisions based on the multi -period alternating current optimal power flow (AC MOPF) problem that jointly analyzes power network, renewable, and hydrogen storage interactions at the operational level by considering the uncertainty of renewable output, seasonality of electricity demand, and electricity prices. We develop a tailored solution approach based on second -order cone programming within a Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. In a test case, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen storage and consideration of the AC MOPF model significantly reduces the operational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide quantitative insights to decision -makers on how to integrate renewable sources and hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price, renewable curtailment cost, emission tax price, and conversion efficiency.

AB The corrosion-fatigue behavior of X65 welded joints, processed by cold metal transfer (CMT) and gas metal arc welding (GMAW) backing, was examined. The application of the CMT backing process led to a 22% increase in the corrosion-fatigue performance, which was attributed to the optimization of the microstructure (synergistic cracking-arrest ability of acicular ferrite (AF) and grain boundary ferrite (GBF)) and the reduction in the stress concentration at the weld root. Nonetheless, a lower heat input contributed to a consequent decrease in corrosion-fatigue performance. In addition, H2S corrosion fatigue was governed by the combined effect of anodic dissolution and hydrogen embrittlement.

AB Mining equipment made of welded metal structures is strongly affected by the corrosion phenomenon due to the working conditions. Initial research has shown that the corrosion phenomenon is most pronounced in the area of cross-welded joints and welded T-shaped joints. In the researches, there was made a chemical analysis of the welded construction material used respectively of the new material and it was observed a reduction in carbon concentration in the material used, but also a substantial increase in the sulfur concentration compared to the new material. The pronounced corrosion of the metallic structure is influenced by the chemical composition change because the sulfur is a grafitizing and weakening element, and the decrease in carbon concentration causes a decrease in corrosion resistance. Also, the pronounced corrosion is due to the action of sulfurous acid (H2SO3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), elements that are present in the working environment of welded constructions. In order to achieve a reduction in the corrosion phenomenon, it is very important that the welded joints are made using the optimal parameters of the welding regime so as to obtain metallographic structure with finer granulations.

AB Reducing carbon dioxide emissions during production is one of the main trends in modern oil and gas chemistry. One of the most realistic possibilities for achieving this is to involve carbon dioxide generated in technological processes as a feedstock for producing gas chemical products. The maximum effect can be achieved in the production of large-scale chemicals, such as syngas, hydrogen, and methanol. We consider such possibilities and present a new combined autothermal process for the joint production of hydrogen and methanol based on non-catalytic matrix conversion of natural gas into syngas, which allows one to almost avoid CO2 emissions.

AB Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) is a common joining method for austenitic stainless steel sheets. Edge joint is frequently used configuration when the aim is to produce weldments e.g., between the tube sheets and the tubes and to other hollow structures needing tight sealing welds and sound joints. In those applications all positions for welding is usually needed. Robotized welding is utilized, when manual welding is not possible, e.g., in maintenance for nuclear power applications. In automatic welding a strict control of location of arc and welding parameters are extremely important.
   In this work the aim was to find suitable welding parameters, as pulse parameters, welding speed and shielding gas composition and study their effects on weld joint penetration and weld quality in different welding positions. In addition, the inaccuracy in the alignment of the arc and its effects was tested in different cases. It was found that it was possible to find the optimal parameters in different positions, flat (PA), overhead (PE), and vertical-up position (PF). However, the vertical-down position (PG) was giving a lower joint penetration in the cases which allow sound welds. Therefore, it was considered that the fabrication of the circumferential joint was best done in two steps to avoid the PG position, which ensures that a sound weld with the set 2.6 mm penetration requirement is achieved over the entire circumference. The use of a shielding gas mixture containing argon and 2% hydrogen showed significant advantages over the other three shielding gas compositions tested, which was observed as deeper penetration of the welds.

AB Assessing the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility of circumferential welds of pipelines with pore defects in gaseous hydrogen environments contributes to the safe operation of hydrogen-blended pipelines. A three-dimensional finite element model coupling defectmechanics-hydrogen diffusion was developed in this study to determine the variation of hydrogen concentration in both lattice and trap sites in the pore region, influenced by pore defect location, size, and cyclic loading frequency. Results show that the distribution of the hydrogen atom concentration at lattice sites resembles the distribution of hydrostatic stress and distribution at trap sites resembles the distribution of plastic strain. Most hydrogen atoms reside in lattice sites rather than dislocation traps. The hydrostatic stress and plastic strain in the pore region change with the pore location due to the constraint conditions during the welding process. The hydrogen atom concentration in pore region at WL-4 and WL-5 (i.e., the filling layers) is relatively high, making these regions susceptible to hydrogen-induced cracking. The strain level at pore defects increases significantly with pore size, accompanied by a rise in hydrogen concentration at trap sites. When the pore diameter is 1 mm, the hydrogen concentration in the pore region reaches its peak level. Even smaller pore defects (with diameter is 0.7 mm) can result in hydrogen enrichment. Cyclic internal pressure reduces the hydrostatic stress level and total hydrogen concentration in the pore region. Under fluctuating internal pressure, low-frequency loading poses the greatest threat to the structural integrity and hydrogen embrittlement resistance of pipeline joints.

AB OBJECTIVE: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is rapidly gaining ground as a physiological mediator of inflammation, but there is no clear consensus as to its precise role in inflammation. Therefore, this study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of ATB-346 as a novel H2S-releasing naproxen compared to naproxen, as a traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug on zymosan induced mono-arthritis in rats.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats (n=48) were randomly assigned to four main groups: normal control, untreated arthritis, Naproxen and ATB-346 treated groups. Mono-arthritis was induced by intra-articular injection of zymosan into the knee joints. Mechanical hypernociception and joint swelling were evaluated at 6 hours and 5 days. Inflammatory cellular recruitment and adherence, tumor necrosis factor alpha, nuclear factor kappa beta, total sulfide levels, and histological changes were evaluated in knee lavages, blood or joint tissues at selected time points.
   RESULTS: Zymosan injection evoked knee inflammation and pain as characterized by mechanical hypernociception, impaired gait, joint swelling with inflammatory exudation and histological changes. Treatment with ATB-346 attenuated nociceptive responses, inflammatory cellular and biochemical changes in comparison to naproxen. Only ATB-346 was able to suppress neutrophil adherence and to preserve normal articular structure.
   CONCLUSIONS: H2S releasing naproxen represents an advancement over the parent drug, naproxen. Apart from the superior anti-inflammatory and anti-noceiceptive activity, ATB-346 offered a distinguished chondroprotective effect and is almost devoid from naproxen deleterious effects on articular cartilage

AB PurposeThis study aims to investigate the effect of galvanic corrosion on the sulfide stress corrosion cracking (SSCC) of X80/Inconel 625 weld overlay by altering the cathode/anode area ratios, Na2S2O3 concentrations and temperatures.Design/methodology/approachThe effects of galvanic corrosion on X80/Inconel 625 weld overlay SSCC were investigated by immersion test, galvanic corrosion current test, electrochemical measurement, four-point bending experiment, hydrogen permeation experiment and scanning electron microscopy.FindingsThe anodic dissolution of the fusion boundary was enhanced as the cathode/anode area ratio increased, which is necessary for the SSCC of the X80/Inconel 625 weld overlay. However, severe galvanic corrosion reduced the SSCC susceptibility. The SSCC susceptibility showed a linear increase with Na2S2O3 concentration in the range of 10-4 similar to 10-2 mol/L. However, further increasing the Na2S2O3 concentration to 10-1 mol/L resulted in the disappearance of SSCC. This is likely because sufficient hydrogen was required for SSCC initiation even under severe anodic dissolution conditions, which was further supported by the reduced SSCC susceptivity at elevated temperatures.Originality/valueLimited studies aim to establish the relationship between the galvanic corrosion and SSCC of welded joints through altering the cathode/anode area ratios, Na2S2O3 concentrations and temperatures. This work will pave the way for understanding the effect of galvanic corrosion on the SSCC of dissimilar weld joints.

AB This study investigates the local strain rate characteristics on the OH layers in the stabilization region of hydrogen syngas turbulent non-premixed jet flames near blowoff. Simultaneous measurements of planar laserinduced fluorescence of OH radicals and particle image velocimetry were involved to obtain the velocity fields and reaction zone thicknesses. The blowoff behaviors are characterized across two regimes: low fuel jet velocity (Regime I) and high fuel jet velocity (Regime II). In Regime I, flame blowoff is primarily governed by lean flammability limits at the rim wake, whereas in Regime II, it is driven by high strain rates and scalar dissipation near the nozzle exit. A joint analysis of the mean velocity field and averaged OH-PLIF images was performed, and a joint probability density analysis of the flow field characteristics and OH thickness properties extracted from the instantaneous fields was also conducted. The result show that flames with higher hydrogen content exhibit greater resistance to blowoff due to higher strain rates in the reaction zone. The statistical distribution of strain rates and OH thickness provides insights into local extinction phenomena, indicating that scalar dissipation plays a crucial role in determining blowoff limits.

AB Casein kinase 2 (CK2) has broad phosphorylation activity against various regulatory proteins, which are important survival factors in eukaryotic cells. To clarify the hydration structure and catalytic mechanism of CK2, we determined the crystal structure of the alpha subunit of human CK2 containing hydrogen and deuterium atoms using joint neutron (1.9 angstrom resolution) and X-ray (1.1 angstrom resolution) crystallography. The analysis revealed the structure of conserved water molecules at the active site and a long potential hydrogen bonding network originating from the catalytic Asp156 that is well known to enhance the nucleophilicity of the substrate OH group to the Upsilon-phospho group of ATP by proton elimination. His148 and Asp214 conserved in the protein kinase family are located in the middle of the network. The water molecule forming a hydrogen bond with Asp214 appears to be deformed. In addition, mutational analysis of His148 in CK2 showed significant reductions by 40%-75% in the catalytic efficiency with similar affinity for ATP. Likewise, remarkable reductions to less than 5% were shown by corresponding mutations on His131 in death-associated protein kinase 1, which belongs to a group different from that of CK2. These findings shed new light on the catalytic mechanism of protein kinases in which the hydrogen bond network through the C-terminal domain may assist the general base catalyst to extract a proton with a link to the bulk solvent via intermediates of a pair of residues.

AB The purpose of this paper is to discuss the potential of hydrogen obtained from renewable sources for energy generation and storage systems. The first part of analysis will address such issues as various methods of green hydrogen production, storage and transportation. The review of hydrogen generation methods will be followed by the critical analysis and the selection of production method. This selection is justified by the results of the comparative research on alternative green hydrogen generation technologies with focus on their environmental impacts and costs. The comparative analysis includes the biomass-based methods as well as water splitting and photo-catalysis methods while water electrolysis is taken as a benchmark. Hydrogen storage and transportation issues will be further discussed in purpose to form the list of recommended solutions.
   In the second part of the paper the technology readiness and technical feasibility for joint hydrogen applications will be analysed. This will include the energy storage and production systems based on renewable hydrogen in combination with hydrogen usage in mobility systems as well as the stationary applications in buildings such as combined heat and power (CHP) plants or fuel cell electric generators. Based on the analysis of the selected case studies the author will discuss the role of hydrogen for the carbon emission reduction with the stress on the real value of carbon footprint of hydrogen depending on the gas source, storage, transportation and applications.

AB In this study, micro -scale cellular and nano -scale labyrinth structures were obtained on the surface of A2024 aluminium alloy adherends through ultrasonic -aided corrosion using an FeCl 3 etchant solution to significantly enhance the mechanical interlock of it and a 30 -wt.% glass -fibre -enhanced polyethylene terephthalate substrate. The tensile shear strength of the 30 -wt.% GF/PET-A2024 joint was increased to 31.84 MPa. The subsequent treatment of an appropriate amount of KH-892/PVA transformed the surface of the aluminium alloy from hydrophobic to hydrophilic to significantly improve its wettability. Furthermore, this treatment generated multiplex hydrogen bonding of O-H & ctdot; O & ctdot; H-N at the interface, further improving the tensile shear strength of the joint up to 50.94 MPa, which is significantly higher than the values obtained using exiting methods. The tensile shear tests of a ring -shaped insulator specimen according to GB 7251-87 verified the improved fracture work equation herein and the bonding strength enhancement of the 30 -wt.% GF/PET-A2024 aluminium alloy joint treated by ultrasonic -aided corrosion with an FeCl 3 etchant solution and pre -coating of an appropriate amount of KH-892/ PVA.

AB The article presents an experimental study on the corrosion resistance of the 3003 Aluminium alloy Friction Stir Welded (FSW) joint in different working environments. Three types of corrosive media at different temperatures were tested to see how they affected the FSW joint mechanical properties. The media were sodium chloride, hydrogen chloride, and ethylene glycol. In parallel with the study of the effect of temperature, static tensile tests were carried out on specimens taken perpendicular to the welding direction. Also, micro-hardness profiles were used to determine the influence of the parameters studied on the various weld zones. Finally, the effect of the most aggressive corrosive medium, temperature, and the inclusion of ethylene glycol on the crack propagation resistance of an FSW joint were studied. Fatigue-propagation tests at constant stress amplitude were carried out to understand what affects the fatigue crack propagation of welded joints after corrosive attack. The results showed that uniform and pitting corrosion were combined to cause FSW joint surface degradation. Corrosion damage does not appear to alter yield strength and ultimate stress values. However, FSW joints show a significant degradation in mechanical properties with increasing temperature and with the aggressiveness of the corrosive medium. The inclusion of ethylene glycol was found to delay the rate of crack propagation during testing, leading to an improvement in the service life of pre-corroded FSW joints.

AB In an integrated power-hydrogen distribution system (IPHDS), on-site hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs) with photovoltaic (PV) systems, battery energy storage systems, electrolyzers (ELs), fuel cells, and hydrogen storage tanks (HSTs) are key devices for maintaining reliable and cost-effective IPHDS operations via power peak shaving while supporting the charging demands of hydrogen vehicles (HVs). This study proposes an optimization framework that ensures profitable and robust operations of on-site HRSs under uncertainties in IPHDSs. Compared with conventional methods that manage IPHDS operation using single HST (S-HST)-based HRSs through only power peak shaving, the proposed method performs dual-peak shaving of power and hydrogen through substations and ELs in multiple HST (M-HST)-based HRSs, respectively. The proposed optimization framework is implemented using chance-constrained optimization (CCO) to address uncertainties in PV generation outputs and HV charging demands in IPHDSs. Furthermore, the proposed CCO framework includes constraints that adjust the predicted HV charging demand, thereby satisfying the actual HV charging demand for each predetermined scheduling period. Numerical examples conducted on IPHDSs (IEEE 33-node and 69-node power distribution systems with three and five on-site HRSs) show that, compared to a method with S-HST and only power peak shaving, the proposed CCO method with M-HST based on dual-peak shaving of power and hydrogen increases the total profit by 5.88% and 8.19% on average, respectively, under varying HV charging demand adjustment period and chance-constraint violation probability.

AB Four types of reactivity indices were employed to construct quantitative structure-activity relationships for the assessment of toxicity of organic chemical mixtures. Results of analysis indicated that the maximum positive charge of the hydrogen atom and the inverse of the apolar surface area are the most important descriptors for the toxicity of mixture of benzene and its derivatives to Vibrio fischeri. The toxicity of mixture of aromatic compounds to green alga Scenedesmus obliquus is mainly affected by the electron flow and electrostatic interactions. The electron-acceptance chemical potential and the maximum positive charge of the hydrogen atom are found to be the most important descriptors for the joint toxicity of aromatic compounds.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
LA English
DT Article
ID ABOVE-THRESHOLD DISSOCIATION; SCHRODINGER-EQUATION; DYNAMICS; H-2(+);
   BOND
AB Isotope effects on the ionization of hydrogen molecular ions in strong laser fields are studied by numerically simulating the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. Though the isotopes of hydrogen molecular ions have identical Born-Oppenheimer potential curves, the distinct ionization scenarios are observed for single-photon, multiphoton, and tunneling ionization. For multiphoton and tunneling ionization, the ionization rate of H-2(+) is larger than that of D-2(+) and T-2(+). The ratio of the intensity-dependent tunneling ionization probabilities of H-2(+) (D-2(+)) and T-2(+) can be qualitatively explained by the adiabatic tunneling theories if a few-femtosecond ultrashort pulse is used. For tens of femtosecond laser pulses, the nuclear movement is unavoidable and the time-dependent Schrodinger equation simulation is necessary in order to calculate the ionization probability accurately. For single-photon ionization, the electron-nuclei joint energy spectra are distinct though the total ionization probabilities are similar. The elastic constant of potential curves can be retrieved by comparing the single-photon-induced electron-nuclei joint energy spectra of different isotopic molecular ions, which offers a potential technique to image molecules.

AB Oxidation of lignin to value-added aromatics through selective C-C bond cleavage via metal-free and mild strategies is promising but challenging. It was discovered that the cations of ionic liquids (ILs) could effectively catalyze this kind of strong bond cleavage by forming multiple weak hydrogen bonds, enabling the reaction conducted in air at temperature lower than 373 K without metal-containing catalysts. The cation [CPMim](+)(1-propylronitrile-3-methylimidazolium) afforded the highest efficiency in C-C bond cleavage, in which high yields (>90 %) of oxidative products were achieved. [CPMim](+)could form three ipsilateral hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atom of C=O and ether bonds at both sides of the C-C bond. The weak bonds joint effects could promote adjacent C-H bond cleave to form free radicals and thereby catalyze the fragmentation of the strong C-C. This work opens up an eco-friendly and energy-efficient route for direct valorization of lignin by enhancing IL properties via tuning the cation.

AB Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) is a critical issue that hinders the reliability of hydrogenation reactors. Hence, it is of great significance to investigate the effect of hydrogen on fracture toughness of 2.25Cr-1Mo-0.25V steel and weld. In this work, the fracture behavior of 2.25Cr-1Mo-0.25V steel and welds was studied by three-point bending tests under hydrogen-free and hydrogen-charged conditions. The immersion charging method was employed to pre-charge hydrogen inside specimen and the fracture toughness of these joints was evaluated quantitatively. The microstructure and grain size of the specimens were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and by metallurgical microscopy to investigate the HE mechanisms. It was found that fracture toughness for both the base metal (BM) and the weld zone (WZ) significantly decreased under hydrogen-charged conditions due to the coexistence of the hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) and hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity (HELP) mechanisms. Moreover, the formation and growth of primary voids were observed in the BM, leading to a superior fracture toughness. In addition, the BM compared to the WZ shows superior resistance to HE because the finer grain size in the BM leads to a larger grain boundary area, thus distributing more of the diffusive hydrogen trapped in the grain boundary and reducing the hydrogen content.

AB This research paper numerically studies how hydrocarbon additives affect hydrogen combustion in the process of complex fuel burning on the example of the combustible foam representing the heptane-in-water emulsion foamed with a hydrogen-oxygen mixture. It is demonstrated that the two-phase hydrodynamic model with an account of foam structure and chemical kinetics reproduces quite accurately, at least at the qualitative level, the experimentally observed features of foamed emulsion combustion. Due to this, it is concluded that a proposed model can be fruitfully used for the interpretation of the combustion features observed in such a complex combined fuel. Based on the obtained numerical data, it is found that there are two main possibilities related to the hydrogen-hydrocarbon chemistry interactions. In the case of near-stoichiometric, hydrocarbons act mainly as an inhibitor of hydrogen combustion; however, for lean hydrogen-oxygen mixtures, flame propagation is determined by the joint hydrocarbon and hydrogen oxidation kinetics. Herewith, the hydrocarbon burns together with the hydrogen inside the flame front in the case of slow combustion, while in the case of high-speed combustion, hydrogen oxidation kinetics becomes predominant, and hydrocarbons evaporate and burn behind the flame front, causing a lesser effect on the flame dynamics.

AB Three possible ways are known to transport hydrogen by pipeline: (i) blending hydrogen into the existing natural gas pipeline system; (ii) using the natural gas transporting pipeline system to transport (pure) hydrogen, typically after retrofitting or repurposing; and (iii) building a new pipeline system to transport (pure) hydrogen. In all three cases, the used welded or non-welded pipes must be joined with girth welds. Therefore, these low-alloy steel pipelines contain a large number of girth welds, which play a key role in the integrity of the whole pipelines. The own integrity of the girth welds can be interpreted as depending on a number of factors. The factors affecting integrity were systematized and the effect of hydrogen for the natural gas transporting pipelines was interpreted. The influence of material quality was illustrated using the example of two conventional pipeline material (X42 and X52, as older materials) and a high-strength pipeline material (X100, as newer material) that is becoming more widely used. Furthermore, various test results for welded joints were also presented.

AB Hydrogen bonding is one of the exciting and interesting research themes because it plays important roles in biomolecules, plant cells, and so on. Here we report hydrogen-bonded complexes among the photodecomposition products of thiazole, being studied by a joint use of infrared (IR) spectroscopy and density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations. Three types of hydrogen-bonded complexes of ethynethiol (HS-C  CH) and hydrogen cyanide (HC  N), which are photodecomposed by two cleavages of the NC-SC and CN-CC single bonds of thiazole in argon matrices, have been identified by comparison of the observed IR spectra with the corresponding calculated spectral patterns. In addition, another complex with weak interaction between S atom and HCF  N, which are photoproduced by cleavages of the three single bonds of thiazole, is detected by comparison with the wavenumbers previously reported in literature. The reaction mechanisms to form these complexes are discussed based on the analysis of IR spectra and the DFT calculations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is one of the most promising high-capacity hydrogen storage materials. However, limited progress has been made in storing hydrogen in Mg under ambient conditions. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the dehydrogenated MgH2 is fully hydrogenated below 100 degrees C with the presence of N-containing Nb2O5 (N-Nb2O5). MgH2 composites doped with N-Nb2O5 (10 wt%) releases hydrogen from 170 degrees C, which is lowered by 130 degrees C compared with pristine MgH2, while still having 6.3 wt% hydrogen capacity available. Most importantly, full hydrogenation can be achieved by the dehydrogenated N-Nb2O5-containing sample at temperature as low as 70 degrees C under 50 atm of hydrogen, which is superior to other known catalyst-doped MgH2 systems. The in-situ formed NbN0.9O0.1 plays the critical catalyst role due to the joint action of N and Nb as elucidated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This finding remarkably facilitates the future design and exploration of much higher-performance catalysts for room-temperature hydrogen storage in metal hydrides.

AB The adoption of electrolytic hydrogen-based steelmaking technology has recently garnered increasing attention as a promising solution for reducing carbon emissions within the framework of industrial decarbonization. Nonetheless, the high costs associated with hydrogen production via electrolysis stand as a key challenge to the widespread deployment of this technology, necessitating strategies to improve its economic feasibility. To that end, this paper introduces an optimal scheduling model for a hydrogen-based steelmaking facility equipped with an on-site electrolysis-based hydrogen production and storage system. The model mainly aims to: 1) exploit lower electricity prices to minimize the overall operating costs of the entire system, 2) contribute to the capacity auction market as a demand response resource for the joint benefit of the steel sector and electricity grid operator, and 3) ensure the safe operation of the hydrogen production system via keeping the hydrogen content in oxygen within safety permissible limits. As such, the economic feasibility of the hydrogen-based steelmaking technology would be further improved due to energy cost savings and extra financial settlements from capacity auction participation. The efficacy of the proposed model is validated using numerical case studies, demonstrating its potential to support the transition to low-carbon steel production.

AB With the widespread utilization of hydrogen energy, the hydrogen safety issues, especially hydrogen jet fires, should be much paid attention to, since the latter present high temperature and radiation in confined space. Hydrogen jet fire experiments were conducted with various release rates and vent sizes in a confined space with ceiling vent to investigate the hydrogen jet flame height, oxygen concentration, and self-extinguishing time. The results show that, the large vent sizes with low hydrogen release rates result in well-ventilated hydrogen jet fires. As the vent size decreases or the hydrogen release rate increases, the hydrogen jet flame evolves from a wellventilated one to one having self-extinguishing behavior with under-ventilation. The combustion process can be divided into four stages: the growth stage, the quasi-steady stage, the stretch stage and the self-extinguishing stage. The flame height increases with the hydrogen release rate at the quasi-steady stage, and the vent size has almost no effect. However, in the case of under-ventilation, the flame height at the stretch stage is determined by the joint actions of vent size and hydrogen release rate, and the flame height is positively connected with the size of the ceiling vent. The oxygen concentration and self-extinguishing time decrease dramatically as the vent size and hydrogen release rate increase. The parameter VA1/3Q is proposed to reflect the coupling effects of hydrogen release rate and vent size, and the correlations of oxygen concentration and self-extinguishing time are determined with Q VA1/3.

AB Hydrogen energy has attracted a lot of interest from researchers as a sustainable and renewable energy source, but there are some technical challenges related to its storage. Hydride materials demonstrate the ability to store hydrogen adequately and safely. In the current study, we have investigated the structural and optoelectronic properties of the XCuH 3 (where X = Li, Na and K) perovskite-type hydride using LDA and GGA formalisms for hydrogen storage application. Electronic properties such as band structure, density of states reveal the metallic character of the studied XCuH 3 hydrides. Various optical parameters such as the complex dielectric function, refractive index, extinction coefficient, absorption coefficient, reflectivity, optical conductivity, energy loss function, and joint density of states have been computed and compared. The gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity for LiCuH 3 , NaCuH 3 and KCuH 3 are found to be 4.11, 3.37 and 2.86 wt%, respectively. The computed values of the gravimetric ratio manifest that XCuH 3 hydrides are potential candidates for hydrogen storage applications. These calculations are made for the first time for XCuH 3 hydrides and will be inspirational in the future for comparison and for hydrogen storage purposes.

AB In this study, a novel MoO3@MoS2/TiO2 photocatalyst with higher photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency was prepared via a hydrothermal followed by quenching method. The prepared composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, UV-Vis Spectrophotometers, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The photocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution was also investigated. The results show that MoS2-340 degrees C/TiO2 exhibits excellent photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency (4669 mu molg(-1)h(-)(1)), which is 5.8 times higher than that of unquenched MoS2/TiO2 under the same conditions. MoO3 on the surface and edges of large layered MoS2 creates more traps adjacent to the joint. More photogenerated electrons can be enriched during the photocatalytic reaction, which achieve the purpose of exposing more active sites.

AB Thermomechanical Controlled Processing (TMCP), the initial microstructure and mechanical properties of rolled products made of high-strength steels, have a significant influence on the properties and reliability of welded structures for low temperature and cryogenic service. This paper systematizes advanced research trends in the field of metallurgy and weldability of high-strength cold-resistant and cryogenic steels. The classification and properties of high-strength steels are given and TMCP diagrams and phase transformations are considered. Modern methods of improving the viscoplasticity of rolled steel and welded joints are analyzed. The problems of the weldability of high-strength steels are reduction of impact toughness at low temperatures, hydrogen embrittlement, anisotropy, and softening of welded joints in the heat-affected zone. The authors propose a systemic concept and methods for improving the metallurgy and weldability of high-strength steels for low temperature and cryogenic service.

AB The steel grade 20MnMoNi5-5 (according to German DIN standard or 16MND5 according to French AFNOR standard) is widely applied in (weld) fabrication of reactor pressure vessel components. Thus, a wide range of welding technologies (like submerged arc welding (SAW) or tungsten inert gas (TIG)) is used resulting in different heat affected zone (HAZ) microstructures. During weld fabrication, the weld joints may take up hydrogen. Especially, the HAZ shows an increased susceptibility for a degradation of the mechanical properties in presence of hydrogen. In addition, the hydrogen-assisted degradation of mechanical properties is influenced by three main local factors: hydrogen concentration, microstructure, and load condition. Hence, the base material (BM) and two different simulated non-tempered as-quenched HAZ microstructures were examined using hydrogen-free and hydrogen-charged tensile specimens. The results indicate that the effect of hydrogen on the degradation is significantly increased in case of the HAZ compared to the BM. In addition, hydrogen has remarkable effect in terms of reduction of ductility. It was ascertained that the degradation of the mechanical properties increases in the order of BM, bainitic HAZ, and the martensitic HAZ. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) investigation showed a distinct change of the fracture topography depended on the microstructure with increasing hydrogen concentration in case of the as-quenched HAZ microstructures.

AB Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) are widespread rheumatic diseases characterized by persistent inflammation and joint destruction. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous gas with important physiologic functions in the brain, vasculature and other organs. Recent studies have found H2S to be a mediator in inflammatory joint diseases.
   Objective: This review summarizes the recent literature in this area highlighting relevant developments.
   Conclusions: Several authors have found that H2S exhibited anti-inflammatory, anti-catabolic and/or anti-oxidant effects in rodent models of acute arthritis and in in vitro models using human synoviocytes and articular chondrocytes from RA and OA tissues. The earliest studies used fast-dissolving salts, such as NaSH, but GYY4137, which produces H2S more physiologically, shortly appeared. More recently still, new H2S-forming compounds that target mitochondria have been synthesized. These compounds open exciting opportunities for investigating the role of H2S in cell bioenergetics, typically altered in arthritides. Positive results have also been obtained when H2S is administered as a sulphurous water bath, an option meriting further study. These findings suggest that exogenous supplementation of H2S may provide a viable therapeutic option for these diseases, particularly in OA.

AB In this investigation, comparative study of tensile and impact properties of multi-pass SMAW Armox 500T steel joints fabricated by austenitic stainless steel (ASS) and low hydrogen ferritic steel (LHF) consumables vis-a-vis base metal was carried out. The tensile tests were conducted on computer controlled Walter + Bai Ag UTM at a nominal strain rate of 10(-3) s(-1). Subsequently, charpy impact tests were carried out on an instrumented Zwick-Roell test setup to obtain load vs. displacement and maximum energy absorbed vs. displacement of the specimen. It was observed that, the joint efficiency of weldment processed by LHF consumable was 41.7% and weldment processed by ASS was 30.6% of its base metal indicating the influence of electrode consumable on tensile properties of the joints. On the contrary, impact toughness of weldment processed by ASS was 20% more and weldment processed by LHF was 12% less than that of base metal. Microstructural studies also revealed that, ASS can be considered as a candidate welding consumable for good strain hardening and toughness of the welding joint in impact applications. However, LHF steel consumable is recommended for welding joints that requires higher joint efficiency under tensile loading conditions. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Hydrogen storage at high pressure is currently attained by the use of different materials, such as elastomers in sealing joints, thermoplastics and thermosetting polymers in high-pressure containers, and metallic tube connections. Hydrogen containers type IV use a thermoplastic polymer for hydrogen tightness and composite materials for mechanical resistance, usually made with thermosetting resins and carbon or glass fibre. International standards impose a wide range of operative temperatures for such containers, from -40 degrees C to 85 degrees C.
   Once saturated with hydrogen at high pressure, a fast depressurisation process can create stress in the polymeric materials, causing its degradation by the formation of cavities. In a previous work, we were able to make a generalization of cavitation risk by the use of non-dimensional parameters, based on a simplified mechanical failure model. We observed that for the model, material's hydrogen diffusivity and yield strength are of up- most importance. In present work, we analyse the effect of temperature on these two properties, as they have an inverse evolution with temperature. Results confirm the pertinence of considering temperature in the whole application range of technology under analyse. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Body fluid is normally the only lubricant after joint replacement surgery, but wear problems have occurred because body fluid has poor lubrication ability. However, traditional lubricant would be diluted by body fluids and then absorbed by the human body. Therefore, an injectable gel with the ability to slow-release lubricant was designed to replace the joint capsule. The proposed gel, poly(ethylene glycol)/chitosan/sodium glycerophosphate (PEG/CS/GP) composite gel was then tested. The tribology results showed that the PEG/CS/GP gel had excellent slow-release properties, especially under pressure, and the PEG played an important role in improving the gel's rheological and mechanical properties. Moreover, this study revealed that the release solution had a good lubrication effect because the PEG and GP could crosslink via the hydrogen bond effect.

AB Resin-based carbon fibre reinforced composite (CFRP) with excellent properties has been widely applied in aerospace industry. In this study, polyether ether ketone enforced composite (PEEK-CFRP) and Ti-6V-4V titanium alloy had been joined by laser welding process. Micro-arc oxidation (MAO) process was conducted on the surface of titanium alloy to improve the joint property. Fractures and mechanical properties of joints were analysed. Interfacial microstructures of the joints had been investigated, and the formation mechanism of joint had been figured out. The results showed that after MAO treatment, the joint strength had been greatly improved and the shear strength reached to 42.3 MPa compared with pretreated sample. The wettability of CFRP on titanium alloy was rising with the contact angle of 68.8 degrees. Fracture showed that cohesive failure contributed to the main fracture mode. As joints were formed by both mechanical bonding and chemical bonding, 'anchor-shaped' structures were found in the joint to enhance the mechanical bonding effects due to the flowing of the melted resin. (-OH) bonds were identified at the surface of MAO-treated titanium alloy that provided conditions for hydrogen bond interaction. TiO2, TiO and Ti-V-C phase were found at interface, whereas Ti-F and Ti-O-F bonds were generated during the welding process, which made great contribution to the chemical bonds between titanium alloy and CFRP.

AB The review summarizes and critically analyzes the results of exploratory and basic studies carried out mainly in the last 10 years concerning the mechanism and role of hydrogen transfer reactions in hydrocarbon conversion processes. A discussion addresses the established views on the regularities of these reactions (mainly involving hydrogen - hydrogen, carbon - carbon and carbon - hydrogen bonds) in various systems containing cations of d-, p - and s-elements. The features of intermolecular hydrogen transfer reactions involved in the zeolite-catalyzed cracking of hydrocarbons are considered. Data on the development of compositions and investigation of properties of modern zeolite-based catalysts for hydrocarbon cracking are discussed. The attention is focused on the role of intermolecular hydrogen transfer in this process, especially in the transformations of heteroatomic compounds. Regarding zeolite compositions, the main attention is paid to the influence of the acid site distribution on the zeolite surface on the hydrogen transfer reactions and the role of extra-framework aluminium species and added modifier cations in these processes. The results of studies of hydrogen transfer by model calculations and by drawing analogies are presented. It is demonstrated that intermolecular hydrogen transfer reactions must be taken into account while addressing problems of improving the cracking catalysts and creating catalytic compositions for joint processing of sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen compounds together with hydrocarbons in the catalytic cracking. The bibliography includes 249 references.

AB The evaluation of the mechanical properties of post-fire high-strength steel welds, particularly for secondary applications in medium- and large-scale infrastructure, is of critical importance in engineering. This study investigates Q690 high-strength steel welds subjected to heat treatment at 300 degrees C, 500 degrees C, 700 degrees C, and 800 degrees C for 20 minutes, followed by air cooling. Electrochemical hydrogen charging, uniaxial tensile testing, and fracture morphology analysis were employed to examine the mechanical properties of these welded components after fire exposure. The effects of hydrogen embrittlement on the mechanical properties and fracture modes of Q690 welds were analyzed, and a hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity index for the welding joints was proposed. The results of the study show that the heat treatment temperature has a significant effect on the hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility of welded structural components. Higher heat treatment temperatures and longer hydrogen charging times lead to a decrease in the mechanical properties of the material, which is characterised by a flatter and smoother macroscopic fracture surface, while the microscopic fracture pattern is characterised by micro-voids. Hydrogen-induced deformation leads to the accumulation of structural defects, such as micro-inhomogeneities and micro-voids, due to increased hydrogen concentrations. Consequently, the material's resistance to brittle failure is diminished.

AB Thick high-strength steel plates are increasingly being used for ship structures. Moreover, hydrogen enters the process of manufacturing and service, and large residual tensile stress occurs near the weld. Such stress can facilitate the diffusion and accumulation of hydrogen in the material, leading to hydrogen embrittlement fracture of the shell. Therefore, residual-stress-induced diffusion and accumulation of hydrogen in the stress concentration region of thick butt-welded high-strength steel plate structures need to be studied. In this study, manual metal arc welding was realized by numerical simulation of residual stress in a thick butt-welded high-strength steel plate model using the thermoelastic-plastic theory and a double ellipsoidal heat source model. To analyze residual stress, a set of numerical simulation methods was obtained through comparative analysis of the test results of relevant literature. Residual and hydrostatic stress distributions were determined based on these methods. Then, hydrogen diffusion parameters in each region of the model were obtained through experimental tests. Finally, the results of the residual stress field were used as the predefined field of hydrogen diffusion to conduct a numerical simulation analysis. The distribution of hydrogen diffusion under the influence of residual stress was obtained based on the theory of stress-induced hydrogen diffusion. The weak area of the welding joint was found to be near the weld toe, which exhibited high hydrostatic stress and hydrogen concentration. Further, the maximum hydrogen concentration value of the vertical weld path was approximately 6.1 ppm, and the maximum value of the path parallel to the weld centerline and 31 mm away from the weld centerline was approximately 6.22 ppm. Finally, the hydrostatic tensile stress in the vertical weld path was maximized (similar to 345 MPa), degrading the material properties and causing hydrogen-related cracking. Hence, a reliable method for the analysis of hydrogen diffusion according to residual stress in thick high-strength steel plates was obtained. This work could provide a research basis for controlling and eliminating the adverse effects of hydrogen on the mechanical properties of ship structures and ensuring the safe service of marine equipment.

AB SiC is highly suitable for the manufacturing of ceramic heat exchangers due to its exceptional strength and thermal conductivity. However, its brittleness makes it difficult to machine directly. Brazing simple SiC components to form stable joints presents a more reliable and efficient method for constructing these complex heat exchanger structures. Since these exchangers operate in high-temperature acidic environments, the reliability of the joints faces inevitable challenges due to the high brittleness and the risk of galvanic corrosion of the heterogeneous interface between SiC and the metallic filler. Ni-based fillers are commonly used for SiC brazing, as the active element Ni reacts with SiC to form Ni-Si phases that establish a bond. However, these Ni-Si phases are generally brittle and susceptible to corrosion. To address this issue, Au was introduced into the brazing joint by designing an AuNi filler. Au forms stable covalent bonds with Si, reducing the formation of brittle Ni-Si phases. The Fermi level of the Ni-Si phase is the highest in both joints, thus indicating a greater susceptibility to corrosion. The Cr-rich phase in the BNi-2 joint promotes severe hydrogen evolution corrosion, whereas the AuNi joint demonstrates significantly greater resistance to this process. Therefore, the AuNi joints achieve higher shear strength (62 MPa) than BNi-2 joints (30.8 MPa) and retain 86.66 % strength after HCl corrosion, compared to BNi-2's 38.31 %. The use of the AuNi filler enhances joint performance and facilitates the production of corrosion-resistant SiC heat exchangers.

AB Wood Polymer Composites (WPCs) have become widely acceptable for use in different products, including furniture. This range of applications could be increased by improvement in effective bonding and jointing techniques. However adhesion between WPC components is problematic because of their low surface energy and the hydrophobic nature of the polyolefin matrices which are commonly used. Surface activation pretreatments using hydrogen peroxide solutions have been investigated, and shown an improvement in lap-joint shear when bonding using epoxy adhesives. The effect on surface energy, roughness and chemical composition was studied. The improvement in adhesion appeared to be governed by the pH of the treatment solution, with clear differences being identified between treatments in acidic and alkaline media.
   The best results were achieved with a mild alkaline hydrogen peroxide treatment at a pH of 7.5 (37% improvement); however a mild acidic hydrogen peroxide treatment also showed a suitable level of adhesion improvement (29%, pH 6). In the alkaline medium it was found that the hydroperoxy anion was efficient in altering both the lignin and the hemicellulose component of the wood flour. It was necessary to limit the extent of wood particle degradation by the hydroperoxy anion, explaining the poor adhesion for treatments with pH 9 peroxide solution. This study indicates that mild (pH 7.5) alkaline treatment solution could be employed. In the acidic medium, the free radical based reaction processes dominated, and were likely to have altered the polypropylene matrix of the WPC material.

AB Zircaloy-4 to Zircaloy-4 (Zr-4) similar butt joints were prepared using Electron Beam Welding (EBW) technique under different weld conditions such as with beam oscillation, without beam oscillation and at different welding speeds. Three-dimensional (3D) visualisation of porosity in weld joints was carried out using X-ray computed tomography (XCT) technique. Quantification of porosity such as the average size, number and shape of the pores were evaluated and compared among weld joints produced under different conditions. XCT results show that the porosity of the welds increased substantially with the increase in the weld speed. More interestingly, the results also show that there is a significant decrease in porosity of the joint produced with beam oscillation condition. An increase in weld speed from 700 mm/min to 1000 mm/min resulted in a significant increase in pore density (from 16 to 313 per mm3) and it was observed that the average size of the macro pores increased from 96.4 mu m to 121.5 mu m. The joints prepared with beam oscillation produced least number of pores with minimum percentage of macro pores and maximum percentage of spherical pores in it. Raman spectroscopy results confirmed the presence of hydrogen gas in pores of all the weld joints.

AB The service life of artificial joints has gradually failed to meet the needs of patients. Herein, the synergistic lubrication and antioxidant efficacies of graphene oxide (GO) and fullerenol (Fol) as biological lubricant additives for artificial joints were investigated. The lubrication mechanisms of biological lubricant containing GO and Fol at the friction interface of artificial joints were then revealed. Tribological tests showed that the average friction coefficients of Al2O3-Ti6Al4V pairs and Ti6Al4V-UHMWPE pairs for artificial joints could be reduced by 30% and 22%, respectively, when GO and Fol were used as biological lubricant additives simultaneously. The lubrication mechanism showed that some incommensurate sliding contact surfaces could be formed between the GO nanosheets and spherical Fol at the interface, which reduced the interaction forces of friction pairs. The maximum scavenging rates of center dot OH and DPPH free radicals by the biological lubricant containing GO and Fol were 35% and 45%, respectively, showing a good antioxidant efficacy of the biological lubricant. This can be attributed to the GO and Fol scavenging free radicals through electron transfer and hydrogen transfer. This study provides a theoretical basis for the development and application of carbon nanomaterials as biological lubricant additives for artificial joints in the future.

SO KERNTECHNIK
LA English
DT Article
AB The THAI (THAI = Thermal hydraulics, Hydrogen, Aerosols, Iodine) experimental programme aims to address open questions concerning the behavior of hydrogen, iodine and aerosols in the containment of water cooled reactors. Since its construction in 2000, THAI programme is being performed in the frame of various national projects (sponsored by German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, BMWi) and two international joint projects (under auspices of OECD/NEA). THAI experimental data have been widely used for the validation and further development of Lumped Parameter (LP) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes with 3D capabilities. Selected examples of code benchmark exercises performed based on the THAI data include; hydrogen distribution experiment (ISP-47 and OECD/NEA THAI code benchmark), hydrogen combustion behaviour (ISP-49), hydrogen mitigation by PARs (OECD/NEA THAI-2 code benchmark), iodine/surface interactions, iodine mass transfer, and iodine transport and multi-compartment behaviour (EU-SARNET and EU-SARNET2), thermal-hydraulic tests (German CFD-network). In the present paper, a brief overview on the THAI experiments and their role in the containment safety assessment is discussed.

AB The dual laser beam bilateral synchronous welding (DLBSW) for T-joint is limited to develop for the porosity defect in joint. In order to investigate the effect of porosity in T-joint, the DLBSW experiment of 2219 Aluminum Alloy T-joint is carried out. While, the distribution of porosity is scanned by X-ray non-destructive testing (NDT) and the size of porosity is measured by particle size analysis software Nano measurer 1.2. The morphology of pore in fracture and the elemental concentration around the pore are investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy spectrometer (EDS). Furthermore, the analysis results of porosity distribution show that the optimal parameter is 3700 W of laser power and 2.5 m/min of welding rate, under which the number of porosities reaches the minimum. The main factor, caused the fracture of weld seam, is the concentrated porosities in T-joint. In addition, technical porosity is mainly found in the center of the weld seam or at the bottom of the weld seam, and it can be eliminated by improving welding parameters. Metallurgical porosity mainly exists at the edge and the top of the weld seam, including hydrogen porosity and metal vapor porosity which formed by the burning of metal elements.

AB This paper summarises the results from 66 vented hydrogen deflagration experiments performed in 20-foot shipping containers: 42 tests with initially homogeneous and quiescent mixtures, and 24 tests with inhomogeneous mixtures. Other parameters investigated include hydrogen concentration, vent area, type of venting device, ignition position, and the level and type of congestion inside the container. The results confirm that internal congestion can increase the maximum reduced explosion pressure in vented deflagrations significantly, compared to vented deflagrations in empty enclosures. As such, it is important to incorporate the effect of congestion in the theoretical and/or empirical correlations recommended in standards and guidelines for explosion protection. The work reported here is a deliverable from work package 2 (WP2) in the project "Improving hydrogen safety for energy applications through pre-normative research on vented deflagrations" (HySEA).

AB This paper describes an experimental programme on vented hydrogen deflagrations, which formed part of the Hyindoor project, carried out for the EU Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the validity of analytical models used to calculate overpressures following a low concentration hydrogen deflagration. Other aspects of safety were also investigated, such as lateral flame length resulting from explosion venting. The experimental programme included the investigation of vented hydrogen deflagrations from a 31 m(3) enclosure with a maximum internal overpressure target of 10 kPa (100 mbar). The explosion relief was provided by lightly covered openings in the roof or sidewalls. Uniform and stratified initial hydrogen distributions were included in the test matrix and the location of the ignition source was also varied. The maximum hydrogen concentration used within the enclosure was 14% v/v. The hydrogen concentration profile within the enclosure was measured, as were the internal and external pressures. Infrared video images were obtained of the gases vented during the deflagrations. Findings show that the analytical models were generally conservative for overpressure predictions. Flame lengths were found to be far less than suggested by some guidance. Along with the findings, the methodology, test conditions and corresponding results are presented.

AB Hydrogen (H-2) gas has recently become a crucial energy source and an imperative energy vector, emerging as a powerful next-generation solution for fuel cells and biomedical, transportation, and household applications. With increasing interest in H-2, safety concerns regarding personal injuries from its flammability and explosion at high concentrations (>4%) have inspired the development of wearable pre-emptive gas monitoring platforms that can operate on curved and jointed parts of the human body. In this study, a yarn-type hydrogen gas sensing platform (HGSP) was developed by biscrolling of palladium oxide nanoparticles (PdO NPs) and spinnable carbon nanotube (CNT) buckypapers. Because of the high loading of H-2-active PdO NPs (up to 97.7 wt %), when exposed to a flammable H-2 concentration (4 vol %), the biscrolled HGSP yarn exhibits a short response time of 2 s, with a high sensitivity of 1198% (defined as Delta G/G(0) x 100%). Interestingly, during the reduction of PdO to Pd by H-2 gas, the HGSP yarn experienced a decrease in diameter and corresponding volume contraction. These excellent sensing performances suggest that the fabricated HGSP yarn could be applied to a wearable gas monitoring platform for real-time detection of H-2 gas leakage even over the bends of joints.

The microstructure, room temperature and high temperature (1173 K) tensile strength of dissimilar weld joints were analyzed through optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electronic universal tensile testing machine. The microstructure of HAZ in 15CrMo steel of Cr25Ni35NbM/15CrMo dissimilar weld joint transformed from ferrite-pearlite into ferrite-martensite. A large volume fraction of alpha phase was found to have precipitated in the HAZ of SUS321 austenitic stainless steel for Cr25Ni35NbM/SUS321 dissimilar weld joint. At room temperature, the tensile strength and yield strength of these two type dissimilar weld joints is less than Cr25Ni35NbM alloy similar weld joint. The high temperature tensile strength of these two type dissimilar weld joints is less than Cr25Ni35NbM alloy similar weld joint. Both at room and high temperature, the fracture locations of two types dissimilar weld joints are the HAZ of the base metal 15CrMo and SUS321 stainless steel, respectively. It indicates that the weak part of the Cr25Ni35NbM alloy dissimilar weld joints is the low-performance base metals 15CrMo and SUS321 stainless steel.

AB The stress corrosion cracking (SCC) behaviors at slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) test of AISI301L stainless steel laser MIG welded joints in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution at 20 degrees C, 40 degrees C and 60 degrees C were investigated. The results showed that the weld metal composed of as-cast with delta-Fe and austenite. The base metal (BM) and heat affected zone (HAZ) contained strain-induced M phase. The stress and strain decreased with the increasing temperature. The SCC cracks are initiated by anodic dissolution at 20 degrees C. Besides the anodic dissolution mechanism, hydrogen-induced SCC mechanism had appeared in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution at 40 degrees C and 60 degrees C.

AB This paper investigates physically crosslinked organo-hydrogels for total hip replacement surgery. Current materials in artificial joints have limitations in mechanical performance and biocompatibility. To overcome these issues, a new approach based on hydrogen bonds between polyvinyl alcohol, poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), and glycerin is proposed to develop bioactive organo-hydrogels with improved mechanical properties and biocompatibility. This study analyzes local pathological characteristics, systemic toxicity, and mechanical properties of the gels. The results show that the gels possess excellent biocompatibility and mechanical strength, suggesting their potential as an alternative material for total hip replacement surgery. These findings contribute to improving patient outcomes in joint replacement procedures.

AB The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Global Technical Regulation (GTR) Number 13 (Global Technical Regulation on Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Vehicles) is the defining document regulating safety requirements in hydrogen vehicles, and in particular, fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). GTR Number 13 has been formally adopted and will serve as the basis for the national regulatory standards for FCEV safety in North America (led by the United States), Japan, Korea, and the European Union. The GTR defines safety requirements for these vehicles, including specifications on the allowable hydrogen levels in vehicle enclosures during in-use and post-crash conditions and on the allowable hydrogen emissions levels in vehicle exhaust during certain modes of normal operation. However, in order to be incorporated into national regulations, that is, to be legally binding, methods to verify compliance with the specific requirements must exist. In a collaborative program, the Sensor Laboratories at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in the United States and the Joint Research Centre, Institute for Energy and Transport in the Netherlands have been evaluating and developing analytical methods that can be used to verify compliance with the hydrogen release requirements as specified in the GTR.

AB Hydrogen fueling stations (HFSs) will proliferate in the near future as they are prerequisites for the fast developing hydrogen-powered vehicles (HVs). The HFSs can utilize cheap renewable energy from, e.g., wind turbines (WTs), to generate and store hydrogen on site locally. Conventional studies usually ignore the independence of the WT and HFSs and perform joint operation optimization to them. This article, however, proposes a cooperative operation model for the WT and HFSs considering individual benefit. Nash bargaining theory is employed to deal with the energy trading and benefit sharing problems during the cooperation. In particular, the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is used to characterize the risk-preference degree of HFSs against the uncertainties of electricity price. Moreover, an improved benders decomposition (BD) algorithm is proposed to solve the energy trading problem in a distributed manner for privacy concern; while an analytical method is developed to solve the payment bargaining problem. Numerical experiments based on two case studies indicate that the cooperation can greatly reduce the hydrogen production cost for HFSs. In addition, the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm in the case studies.

AB The invited talk given at MH2014 in Salford ranged over many issues associated with hydrogen isotope separation, fusion machines and the hydrogen/metal systems found in the Joint European Torus (JET) machine located near Oxford. As this sort of talk does not lend itself well to a paper below I have attempted to highlight some of the more pertinent information. After a description of the Active Gas Handling System (AGHS) a brief summary of isotope separation systems is described followed by descriptions of three major projects currently being undertaken by the Tritium Engineering and Science Group (TESG), the upgrade to the Analytical Systems (AN-GC) at the AGH, the construction of a Water Detritiation System (WDS) and a Material Detritiation Facility (MDF). Finally, a review of some of the challenges facing fusion with respect to metal/hydrogen systems is presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of hydrogen enrichment on flame and flow dynamics of a swirl-stabilised partially premixed methane-air flame are studied using large eddy simulation. The sub-grid reaction rate is modelled using unstrained premixed flamelets and a presumed joint probability density function approach. Two cases undergoing thermoacoustic oscillations at ambient conditions are studied. The addition of hydrogen modifies both thermoacoustic and fluid dynamical characteristics. The amplitude of the fundamental thermoacoustic mode increases with the addition of 20% hydrogen by volume. A second pressure mode associated with the chamber mode is also excited with the hydrogen addition. Intermittent single, double and triple helical instabilities are observed in the pure methane case, but are suppressed substantially with hydrogen addition. The results are analysed in detail to shed light on these observations. The feedback loop responsible for the thermoacoustic instability is driven by mixture fraction perturbations resulting from the unequal impedances of the fuel and air channels. It is shown that hydrogen addition increases the flame's sensitivity to these perturbations, resulting in an increase in amplitude. This higher amplitude thermoacoustic oscillation, along with a higher local heat release rate in the presence of hydrogen, is shown to considerably modify the flow structures, leading to a suppression of the helical instabilities.

AB In the past decades, complex hydrides and complex hydrides-based materials have been thoroughly investigated as materials for energy storage, owing to their very high gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen capacities and interesting cation and hydrogen diffusion properties. Concerning hydrogen storage, the main limitations of this class of materials are the high working temperatures and pressures, the low hydrogen absorption and desorption rates and the poor cyclability. In the past years, research in this field has been focused on understanding the hydrogen release and uptake mechanism of the pristine and catalyzed materials and on the characterization of the thermodynamic aspects, in order to rationally choose the composition and the stoichiometry of the systems in terms of hydrogen active phases and catalysts/destabilizing agents. Moreover, new materials have been discovered and characterized in an attempt to find systems with properties suitable for practical on-board and stationary applications. A significant part of this rich and productive activity has been performed by the research groups led by the Experts of the International Energy Agreement Task 32, often in collaborative research projects. The most recent findings of these joint activities and other noteworthy recent results in the field are reported in this paper. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Corrosion resistance is a crucial property to achieve successful superconducting joints of Y0.5Gd0.5Ba2Cu3O7-z (YGdBCO) coated conductors (CCs). Cu and Ag metallic layers need to be fully removed from the area of conductor to be joint to allow for a superconducting path across the joint. Therefore, when using a wet etching process to remove the metallic layers, the joint performance can be significantly influenced by the etching conditions. The effects of chemical etching with ammonia water and hydrogen peroxide mixture on crystal structure, surface microstructure and critical current (I-c) of YGdBCO CCs were systematically investigated. We found the set of etching parameters that does not affect conductor performance, leaving the I-c of the YGdBCO conductor unchanged upon etching. However, when the etching conditions are not optimal, decrease in I-c was found and the underlying reasons driving the degradation were investigated. Raman spectroscopy and XRD analysis indicated that the reduced I-c is mainly due to oxygen deficiency in the YGdBCO crystal lattice.

AB The waste gasification has emerged as a promising method for waste treatment and energy generation, but high operational costs hinder its development. Currently, waste gasification plants are aggregated with renewable energy sources into virtual power plant to participate in the combined electricity-hydrogen market, thereby increasing its profitability. Even so, the carbon reduction potential of this technology is often overlooked, limiting the development of waste resource treatment. Based on this, this paper introduces a tradable green certificate market and a carbon emissions trading market to convert carbon reduction potential into economic benefits. Further, inter-market coupling and price transmission relationships are described for electricity, hydrogen, carbon and green certificate markets under dynamic prices. A bi-level bidding strategy model for the joint electricity-hydrogen-carbon-green certificate market is constructed. Finally, the model was tested on a modified IEEE 9-bus grid and a 7-node hydrogen network, showing that the introduction of the carbon emissions trading and green certificate market improves the total return of virtual power plant aggregated waste gasification plants by about 798 parts per thousand. The scheme proposed improves the economic efficiency of waste resource treatment and enhances synergies between various energy markets, while facilitating stable grid integration of renewable energy sources, with a broad development perspective.

AB In this study, a strain sensor via two-component polyurethane was introduced. The sensor has a laminated structure composed of an amino functional silane KH-550/short-hydroxyl multi-wall carbon nanotube (SHMWCNTs) layer and a graphene nanoplates (GNs)/silver nanoparticles(Ag)/silicone rubber (SR) layer. The hydrogen bonding between layers imparted high tensile strength (650%), wide linear sensing region (0-400%), high linearity, high response rate, low detection limit (0.5%) and long-term durability to the proposed resistive strain sensor. The strain sensor was affixed to data bands and a data glove for monitoring human body motions, including finger joint, knee joint, and calf movements. Furthermore, the gait detection was performed. Owing to the advantages of the laminated strain sensor, namely, its simple preparation process and excellent electrical properties, new avenues are expected to be opened for research on strain sensors in wearable and flexible electronics.

AB Carrier gas hot extraction (CGHE) is a commonly applied technique for determination of hydrogen in weld joints using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for hydrogen measurement. The CGHE is based on the accelerated hydrogen effusion due to thermal activation at elevated temperatures. The ISO 3690 standard suggests different specimen geometries as well as necessary minimum extraction time vs. temperature. They have the biggest influence on precise hydrogen determination. The present study summarizes the results and experience of numerous test runs with different specimen temperatures, geometries (ISO 3690 type B and small cylindrical samples), and factors that additionally influence hydrogen determination. They are namely specimen surface (polished/as-welded), limited TCD sensitivity vs. specimen volume, temperature measurement vs. effects of PI-furnace controller, as well as errors due to insufficient data assessment. Summarized, the temperature is the driving force of the CGHE. Two different methods are suggested to increase the heating rate up to the desired extraction temperature without changing the experimental equipment. Suggestions are made to improve the reliability of hydrogen determination depended on the hydrogen signal stability during extraction accompanied by evaluation of the recorded data. Generally, independent temperature measurement with dummy specimens is useful for further data analysis, especially if this data is used for calculation of trapping kinetics by thermal desorption analysis (TDA).

AB The influence of moisture absorption on the weldability of carbon-fiber-reinforced Polyamide 66 (C-f/PA66) was investigated via ultrasonic welding in a lap-joint configuration. Results showed the joint strength decreased significantly when moisture absorption was up to 1 wt-% and decreased slightly with low moisture. The water molecules decreased the hydrogen bridge bond in polymer chains, which not only plasticized the composite but also changed the loss modulus of the composite. The fracture surface observations showed the increase in moisture resulted in a decreased weld area, increased voids, and severe deformation around the voids, especially for high moisture content (> 1 wt-%). As a result, the joint with high moisture exhibited interfacial fracture. This deleterious effect of moisture on the weldability of C-f/PA66 can be reversed by completely redrying before welding. The amplitude during welding decreased with increasing moisture and displayed a similar varying tendency as that of tensile strength and weld area of joint. The joint strength increased linearly with the amplitude and was influenced slightly by moisture when the amplitude was larger than 100 mu m during welding. Therefore, the amplitude was proposed as an indication in monitoring weld quality.

AB Hydrogen-induced damage is an inevitable challenge in pipeline safety applications, especially, the fusion welded joints owing to microstructure heterogeneity caused by welding process. In this work, X100 pipeline steel was subjected to friction stir welding (FSW) at rotation rates of 300-600 rpm under water cooling, and the relationship among the microstructure, hydrogen diffusivity, and hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior of the nugget zone (NZ) were studied. The NZ at 600 rpm had the highest effective hydrogen diffusion coefficient (Deff) of 2.1 x 10-10 m2/s because of the highest dislocation density and lowest ratio of effective grain boundary. The Deff decreased with decreasing rotation rate due to the decrease of dislocation density and the increase of ratio of effective grain boundary, and the lowest Deff of 1.32 x 10-10 m2/s was obtained at 300 rpm. After hydrogen charging, the tensile strength of all specimens decreased slightly, while the elongation decreased significantly. As the rotation rate decreased, the elongation loss was obviously inhibited, and ultimately a lowest elongation loss of 31.8% was obtained at 300 rpm. The abovementioned excellent mechanical properties were attributed to the fine ferrite/ martensite structure, low Deff, and strong {111}//ND texture dramatically inhibiting hydrogen-induced cracking initiation and propagation.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB High strength steel welded joints are usually fabricated by heterogeneous weld metal for reducing the negative impacts of microstructural characteristics and defects on mechanical properties, such as hydrogen embrittlement cracking, joint toughness decreasing, etc. To reflect material heterogeneity in the mechanical characteristics, two kinds of weld filler material are selected to obtain Evenmatched Welded Material (E-WM) and Undermatched Welded Material (U-WM) marine Ni-Cr-Mo-V steel welded joints. The Fatigue Crack Growth (FCG) behaviors of Base Metal (BM) and related welded joints are investigated considering load ratio (0.1, 0.4, 0.7) and specimen state (as-welded and heat-treated) effects. The experimental FCG trends for BM and weldments have been compared with the trends available in standards. The FCG rate (da/dN) results show the U-WM demonstrates higher FCGR curves than BM and E-WM. Additionally, it demonstrates no significant difference about FCGR for E-WM and U-WM under high R-ratios (0.4 and 0.7). Moreover, both E-WM and U-WM in as-welded state presents higher fatigue crack propagation resistance than in the Post Welded Heat Treatment (PWHT) state. The fracture mechanism of FCG was analyzed according to the fatigue crack trajectory in microstructures and fractography. Transgranular fracture behavior were observed with some secondary particles in E-WM, while the intergranular fracture was exhibited with few tiny secondary microcracks in U-WM.

AB Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), normally used in the prevention of local bacterial infection, is also used for clinical debridement in bone and joint surgery. Studies show that treatment with H2O2 can cause cartilage damage, leading to postoperative complications. H2O2 can induce apoptosis because of its strong oxidation activity. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of H2O2-induced chondrocyte apoptosis, the rat chondrocytes from the knee joint were used as a cell model for this study. The results showed that the H2O2-treated cells survived at a decreased rate, with apoptosis in a great number of chondrocytes. The expression of pro-apoptotic factors of chondrocytes, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, were downregulated, while the pro-apoptotic factor Bax upregulated. Two important factors ERK and p38 in MAPK signaling pathway were phosphorylated at a higher level, leading to apoptosis of chondrocytes. This study described the molecular mechanism of H2O2-induced chondrocyte apoptosis, providing a theoretical basis for the rational and clinical use of H2O2 as a disinfectant.

AB 5052 Al and carbon fiber-reinforced polyamide 6 composite (CF-PA6) were jointed via ultrasonic welding with the assistance of temperature compensation device. The effects of the ultrasonic welding time and temperature compensation on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the joints were investigated. Through analysis of the wettability and fluidity of the molten carbon fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites (CFRTP), the bonding mechanism and failure path of Al/CFRTP were clarified. The results show that under the conditions of temperature compensation of 220 degrees C and welding time of 1500 ms, the joint strength of the two components reaches 2480.4 N, which is 813.6% higher than that of Al/CFRTP components obtained at room temperature. Overall, temperature compensation prolonged the wetting time of molten CFRTP on the aluminum alloy surface. When the fluidity and wettability were coordinated with each other, a high-quality joint was formed. In addition, the ultrasonic welding process of Al/CFRTP mainly relies on "physical adsorption," "diffusion effect," and "mechanical locking effect" to achieve sufficient bonding, and the effect of hydrogen bonding is weak.

AB Currently, no systematic approach exists for the safety assessment method of hydrogen transmission low-strength pipeline, it is necessary to study the effect of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) on the method of failure assessment diagram (FAD) for the defective pipe. The hydrogen charging experiments of tensile and Charpy impact specimens for the L245 pipe steel were carried out with charging time of 0, 30, 90, and 120 h, and then the tensile and Charpy impact tests were immediately conducted. The HE indexes of tensile and Charpy impact properties were presented to quantitatively analyze the effect of HE under tensile and impact deformation processes. Subsequently, the FAD method coupled with the effect of HE was investigated to analyze the difference in the safety assessment method between hydrogen and non-hydrogen environments. Finally, the fracture morphology of tensile and Charpy impact specimens was observed to analyze the responses of microscopic fracture modes between hydrogen and non-hydrogen environments. The results show that the effect of HE on the tensile properties of the base material is more sensitive than that of the weld joint. The FAC with the effect of HE for safety assessment of defective pipes shrinks by reducing the safe zone. The decrease ratio of safety factors affected by HE presents an increasing tendency as the increase of crack depth while showing a decreasing tendency as the increase of internal pressure.

AB The rule of triple joints has recently been proved for two-dimensional phase diagrams and two-dimensional sections of phase diagrams of a higher dimension (Antonov, 2013). The present paper is extending this rule to phase diagrams of binary metal-hydrogen systems composed of a metal immersed in a hydrogen gas. The rule is shown to be valid for every triple point in the temperature-pressure phase diagrams of these systems, including the points with the intersecting boundary lines tangent to each other. The paper also considers the sufficient conditions for the application of the rule to triple points in the projections of phase diagrams onto the temperature-concentration plane.

AB In the context of energy crisis, the use of MoS2 for photocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen is very attractive. The narrow light absorption range and rapid carrier recombination are the key issues limiting the photocatalytic performance of MoS2. The heterostructure CdS/MoS2/CNFs composite catalyst was prepared by electrospinning, high-temperature calcination and solvothermal method. The composite exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm), and 1.0-CMC exhibits an optimal hydrogen evolution rate of 3195.52 mu molg(-1)h(- 1), which is 17 times that of pure MoS2. The results demonstrate that the enhanced photocatalytic performance is attributed to the joint effect of the heterojunction structure and flake MoS2. (1) The compact heterojunction structure is formed between CdS and MoS2, which greatly improves the transfer rate of photogenerated carriers. (2) The flake MoS2 provides abundant active sites and promotes the hydrogen evolution reaction. This work prepared a new type of nano-photocatalytic material, which has great potential in the application of photocatalytic hydrogen production.

AB This study aims to investigate the impact of various surface conditions prior to welding on the susceptibility of materials to cold cracking, including an analysis of fracture surfaces. Additionally, a novel method is introduced for quantifying the presence of diffusible hydrogen using thermal desorption analysis (TDA). This method allows for the determination of diffusible hydrogen concentration in thin sheet welded joints without use of welding consumables. Three different cold-rolled Advanced high-strength steel (AHSS) samples with different surface conditions, such as coatings, lubrication, or water, are examined to assess their susceptibility to cold cracking. In addition to measuring the diffusible hydrogen content in both the base material and the coating, the overall hydrogen content of the base material is also measured using the melt extraction (ME) method. The new method for quantifying diffusible hydrogen in weld metal is applied to investigate different welding variations, intentionally introducing hydrogen through coatings and hydrogenous fluids on the sheet surface. By combining the assessment of cracking susceptibility and hydrogen content, a better understanding of critical hydrogen levels leading to hydrogen-assisted cracking (HAC) is achieved. The results of this study demonstrate that the occurrence of cold cracking in specific AHSS samples increases when either lubrication or both coating and water or lubricant are added. Additionally, the presence of diffusible hydrogen in the welds of all materials is found to increase with the introduction of hydrogenous layers to the material. Although a critical hydrogen content is identified, no clear correlation between the amount of hydrogen and cracking susceptibility can be determined. These findings have significant implications for the welding of cold-formed AHSS, particularly in the automotive industry where safety and lightweight design are of paramount importance.

AB In this work, the influence of hydrogen on the microstructure and fracture toughness of API 5L X80 high strength pipeline steel welded by friction stir welding was assessed. Samples were hydrogenated at room temperature for a duration of 10 h in a solution of 0.1 M H2SO4 + 10 mg L-1 As2O3, with an intensity current of 20 mA cm(-2). Fracture toughness tests were performed at 0 degrees C in single-edged notched bending samples, using the Critical Crack Tip Opening Displacement (CTOD) parameter. Notches were positioned in different regions within the joint, such as the stir zone, hard zone, and base material. Hydrogen induces internal stress between bainite packets and ferrite plates within bainite packets. Besides, hydrogen acted as a reducer of the strain capacity of the three zones. The base metal had a moderate capacity to resist stable crack growth, displaying a ductile fracture mechanism. While the hard zone showed a brittle behavior with CTOD values below the acceptance limits for pipeline design (0.1-0.2 mm). The fracture toughness of the stir zone is higher than that of the base metal. Nevertheless, the stir zone displayed higher data dispersion due to its high inhomogeneity. Hence, it can also show a brittle behavior with critical CTOD values. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Arthritis, a common joint disease, has acquired extensive attention from researchers due to its high incidence and still difficult to treat. Hydrogen sulfide, a typical anti-oxidative stress signaling molecule, plays a key role in maintaining redox homeostasis and we therefore speculate that H2S is closely associated with arthritis. In this paper, a novel near-infrared H2S fluorescent probe, NIR-Ar-H2S, was rationally designed and synthesized for visualizing the changes of H2S content in arthritis. The probe possesses many advantages such as near-infrared emission, a large Stokes shift, good optical stability, and low detection limit (0.18 mu M), which guarantees the detection of exogenous and endogenous H2S. More importantly, H2S levels were elevated in the arthritis model compared to normal joints, whereas H2S levels decreased after treatment. We expect that this finding will provide valuable guidance for the diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation of arthritis, thereby facilitating arthritis pa-thology research and drug development.

AB The positive effect of nitrogen in the backing gas on the pitting corrosion resistance when welding duplex stainless steels with the gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process is discussed and the further improvement with up to 10 % hydrogen emphasised. In this work, 16 mm thick super duplex EN 1.4410/UNS S32750 was welded with three different backing gases (100 % Ar, 100 % N-2 and 90 % N-2 + 10 % H-2) in a butt joint with and without root gap. The rest of the joint was filled using the flux-cored arc welding (FCAW) process. The fillers were of ISO 25 9 4 NL type. The welds were subject to ferrite measurement, impact toughness, tensile, hardness and bend testing, while pitting corrosion resistance was determined in accordance with ASTM G48 Method E. The welds performed with 100 % Ar showed somewhat higher impact toughness, but it was only the 90 % N-2 + 10 % H-2 welds that passed the corrosion test.

AB The paper describes process development for producing sound, strong, and ductile Nb pipe-316L stainless steel (SS) flange brazed joint suitable for application in superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities. The developed transition joints, made with BVAg-8 braze filler metal (BFM), were free of brittle intermetallic compounds, in contrast to the existing global brazing practice of using oxygen-free electronic copper as BFM which results in the formation of a continuous layer of Fe-Nb brittle intermetallic compound at Nb-braze interface. In view of the large difference in the mean thermal expansion coefficients between niobium and 316L stainless steel, a new design for manufacturing and assembly (DFMA) has been developed to ensure achievement of desired joint thickness with uniformity in circumferential and longitudinal directions. An environment-friendly prebraze cleaning procedure has been qualified and implemented. DFMA has resulted in (i) significant reduction of the out-of-roundness errors (<= 10 mu m) while machining of the niobium pipe, (ii) simplified clearance fit prebraze assembly at room temperature (RT), and (iii) uniformity of joint thickness. A process flow chart has been developed to ensure repeatability of joint characteristics. The brazed joint, of niobium pipe and 100CF knife edge 316L SS flange made by standardized practice, displayed helium leak tightness better than 5 x 10(-10) mbar l/s at RT and at liquid helium temperature (LHT). The braze-joint sustained 873 K/10 h postbraze hydrogen degassing treatment and thermal cycling between RT and LHT without any loss in hermeticity.

AB In the present study, the influence of six different process parameters and three interactions on joint tensile strength, toughness, fusion zone microhardness variation are studied during dissimilar tungsten inert gas welding between austenitic stainless steel AISI 316 and alloy steel AISI 4340. Detailed experimental study using fractional factorial experimental design and subsequent statistical analysis show that higher tensile strength, toughness can be achieved using ER 309 filler material and suitably selecting the other process parameters and heating conditions. Addition of small proportion of hydrogen in shielding gas increases the heat transfer efficiency, melting and subsequent penetration. Preheating of AISI 4340 material reduces the chance of solidification cracking and post-heating helps to improve the joint mechanical property. Microstructural observations show that improper selection of process parameters may lead to micro-pores and degrade the joint quality. Successful joining of the dissimilar materials greatly depends on the selection of optimum process parameters, filler material and shielding gas.

AB The difficulty and long duration of start-up wastes numerous costs, labors and time and a little fluctuate during the process might fail it. However, studies dealing with the problem hindering accelerated start-up are still insufficient. Current research focused to develop a method for accelerated start-up in an efficient way. This work outlined a novel alternative for accelerated start-up. This joint method, adding waste effluent with applying biofilm reactor, could successfully start up hydrogen production in the first 24 h via increasing ability of hydrogen producers while the control group produced little hydrogen. The two factors, biofilm formation and addition of waste effluent, expressed the combined effects on accelerated start-up. This study suggested that little molecules like quorum sensing system factors and indoles might be the crucial regulating and stimulating factors and express the accelerated start-up ability only in biofilm reactors.

AB Solder pad oxidation presents a significant challenge in electronic packaging, reducing solder wettability and compromising solder joint reliability. This study investigates the enhancement of solder joints through atmospheric pressure plasma (APP) cleaning, employing both pre- and post-treatment methods. Using a mixture of argon gas and 5% hydrogen, the APP system effectively eliminates oxides, as confirmed by the H alpha peak observed in Optical Emission Spectroscopy analysis, indicating successful hydrogen radical induction. Cross-sectional analysis via Scanning Electron Microscopy demonstrated that samples subjected to both pre- following post-treatment achieved optimal wettability, with a minimum contact angle of 29.5 degrees between solder balls and copper substrates. The pre-treatment promoted the formation of intermetallic compounds at the interface, while the post-treatment effectively removed the tin oxide shell, facilitating proper solder wetting onto the substrate and enhancing overall wetting performance. During plasma post-treatment, the oxide removal rate reached 87.47 nm/min, which is significantly faster than the copper oxide formation rate (2.29 nm/min) during reflow leading to low oxygen content (1.23%) at copper substrate surface. Electron Probe Micro-Analyzer (EPMA) analysis confirmed the absence of continuous oxide layers on both tin balls and copper surfaces, further validating the improvement in wettability. This study underscores the efficiency of APP cleaning in minimizing oxidation and enhancing solder wettability, providing valuable insights for optimizing plasma cleaning techniques to ensure superior solder ability and reliability in electronic packaging.

AB We investigated the hydrogen distribution and desorption behavior in an electrochemically hydrogen charged binary Ni-Nb model alloy to study the role of delta phase in hydrogen embrittlement of alloy 718. We focus on two aspects, namely, (1) mapping the hydrogen distribution with spatial resolution enabling the observation of the relations between desorption profiles and desorption sites; and (2) correlating these observations with mechanical testing results to reveal the degradation mechanisms. The trapping states of hydrogen in the alloy were globally analyzed by Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS). Additionally, spatially resolved hydrogen mapping was conducted using silver decoration, Scanning Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (SKPFM) and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS): The Ag decoration method revealed rapid effusion of hydrogen at room temperature from the gamma-matrix. The corresponding kinetics was resolved in both, space and time by the SKPFM measurements. At room temperature the hydrogen release from the gamma-matrix steadily decreased until about 100 h and then was taken over by the delta phase from which the hydrogen was released much slower. For avoiding misinterpretation of hydrogen signals stemming from environmental effects we also charged specimens with deuterium. The deuterium distribution in the microstructure was studied by SIMS. The combined results reveal that hydrogen dissolves more preferably inside the gamma-matrix and is diffusible at room temperature while the delta phase acts as a deeper trapping site for hydrogen. With this joint and spatially resolving approach we observed the microstructure- and time-dependent distribution and release rate of hydrogen with high spatial and temporal resolution. Correlating the obtained results with mechanical testing of the hydrogen-charged samples shows that hydrogen enhanced decohesion (HEDE) occurring at the delta/matrix interfaces promotes the embrittlement.

AB Hydrogen represents a clean and storable energy solution that could meet worldwide energy demands and reduce greenhouse gases emission. The joint research project (JRP) 'Metrology for sustainable hydrogen energy applications' addresses standardisation needs through pre- and co-normative metrology research in the fast emerging sector of hydrogen fuel that meet the requirements of the European Directive 2014/94/EU by supplementing the revision of two ISO standards that are currently too generic to enable a sustainable implementation of hydrogen. The hydrogen purity dispensed at refueling points should comply with the technical specifications of ISO 14687-2 for fuel cell electric vehicles. The rapid progress of fuel cell technology now requires revising this standard towards less constraining limits for the 13 gaseous impurities. In parallel, optimized validated analytical methods are proposed to reduce the number of analyses. The study aims also at developing and validating traceable methods to assess accurately the hydrogen mass absorbed and stored in metal hydride tanks; this is a research axis for the revision of the ISO 16111 standard to develop this safe storage technique for hydrogen. The probability of hydrogen impurity presence affecting fuel cells and analytical techniques for traceable measurements of hydrogen impurities will be assessed and new data of maximum concentrations of impurities based on degradation studies will be proposed. Novel validated methods for measuring the hydrogen mass absorbed in hydrides tanks AB, AB2 and AB5 types referenced to ISO 16111 will be determined, as the methods currently available do not provide accurate results. The outputs here will have a direct impact on the standardisation works for ISO 16111 and ISO 14687-2 revisions in the relevant working groups of ISO/TC 197 'Hydrogen technologies'.

ID RECOMMENDATIONS; PERFORMANCE; STATISTICS
AB As part of the global transition to low-carbon energy systems, the accelerated construction of Hydrogen Refuelling Stations plays a vital role in supporting the uptake of hydrogen-powered transport. Ensuring the safety and reliability of these facilities is therefore increasingly critical. While various risk assessment models have been developed, the systematic analysis of real-world operational experience is still underrepresented in the literature. This study addresses that gap by expanding the analysis of the Japanese KHK accident database through a newly developed typology that captures not only the causes and types of hydrogen releases but also the role of safety barriers and emergency responses. The findings highlight that most hydrogen leakage accidents occurred during normal operation, with a significant number also arising during inspections and testing. Common causes included equipment failures, particularly in valves, joints, and seals, as well as human errors. Dispensers, compressors, and storage units were frequently involved. Although fixed and portable detectors were vital for leak identification, reliance on low-tech methods and operator vigilance remained essential due to occasional detection failures. Overall, the study underscores the need for both technical and organisational improvements, such as system redundancies, revised maintenance practices, and institutional learning, to enhance overall hydrogen station safety.

AB We analyze the mechanical properties of heat-resistant steels after long-term operation at thermal power plants. It is shown that the operating conditions (high temperature and pressure of hydrogenating corrosive media, thermal and mechanical stresses) negatively affect their structural-mechanical state. We generalize the results of evaluation of the mechanical characteristics of steels after their operation in various elements (straight sections, pipe bends, and welded joints) of the main steam pipelines of thermal power plants under the joint influence of the in-service factors. On this basis, we rank the analyzed steels according to their sensitivity to high-temperature hydrogen degradation.

AB The additive manufactured (AM) parts of aluminum alloys have been widely used in defense, aerospace, automotive and other industries. There is a growing demand for joining or repairing of the AM parts of aluminum alloys using welding technology. However, the problems of high porosity and joint softening are occurred when welding of aluminum alloy AM parts, which have become technical bottlenecks that need to be solved urgently. Laser welding of AlSi10Mg alloys fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM) with an addition of Er and Zr in the filler metal was carried out. The effect of Er and Zr addition on the porosity, microstructures and mechanical properties of the welded joints was investigated, and the contribute of Er and Zr addition to the yield strength (YS) of the welded joints was calculated. Compared that joints without Er and Zr addition, the average ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and YS of the welded joints with Er and Zr addition have been increased by 10.5% and 23.5%, respectively. The improved mechanical poverty of the welded joints is due to the refined alpha-Al grains and Si-rich cellular networks, and the reduced hydrogen pores occurred in the weld metal (WM) with the addition of Er and Zr. The YS calculation of the weld joints indicates the most important contribution to the YS is the enhancement effect of the Si-rich networks with Er and Zr.

AB Microstructure, tensile property, microhardness and fracture behavior of the hydrogenated Ti-0.3Mo-0.8Ni alloy gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) joints were investigated. The results show that the microstructure of the hydrogenated 0.21 wt.% H weld zone were composed of alternating lamellar alpha/needle-like transformed beta and the hydride. Transformed beta was secondary decomposed into the short rod-shaped secondary alpha and lamellar residual beta. The "Pinning" effect of the hydride and more difficult dislocations cross slip directly led to the increased ultimate tensile and yield strength. Average hardness of weld zone, heat affected zone and base metal for the hydrogenated specimens were 196, 177 and 169 HV respectively. Hardness of the former was greater than that of the latter two, hydrogen-induced hardness of the welded joint was significantly increased. Fracture mode of the hydrogenated welded joints changed from the single ductile fracture to mainly brittle fracture with a few dimples fracture. Main cracks that propagated alternately to the original beta grain boundary resulted in local fracture of the microstructure, the interconnected local fractures finally led to the overall fracture of the hydrogenated welded joint.

AB Dissimilar joining of mild steel and Fe-7% Al alloy was carried out using electron beam welding (EBW) process under three different weld operating conditions such as with beam oscillations, without beam oscillations and at higher welding speeds. Laboratory based X-ray computed tomography (XCT) was used for three dimensional (3D) visualisation of porosity under various welding conditions. Quantitative analysis of porosity such as the average size and number of pores were evaluated from XCT results as a function of beam oscillation and welding speed. XCT results show that the application of beam oscillation results in decrease in average size of the pores as well as a decrease in number of pores in the welded joints. Further, it was observed that an increase in weld speed results in an increase in porosity in the weld joint. Raman spectroscopy analysis shows the presence of hydrogen gas which could be responsible for porosity formation in EBW dissimilar joints. This study shows that the application of beam oscillation improves the weld quality by decreasing the porosity in the weld joints. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aluminum alloy AA2219 is used for the fabrication of the liquid hydrogen (fuel, boiling point 20K) and liquid oxygen (oxidizer, boiling point 90K) propellant tanks of cryogenic engine in view of its good weldability, compatibility with propellants and excellent mechanical properties at the operating temperatures. The propellant tanks are fabricated using fine-grained thin sheet/plate, roll bent to form cylindrical shells and are welded to large coarse-grained intermediate/end seamless ring-rolled products. The integrity of the weld joints and the mechanical properties need to be ascertained for the joints with coarse- and fine-grained microstructures to demonstrate the safety margins on the tank design. Therefore, detailed experiments were conducted to study the effect of grain size and grain aspect ratio on the mechanical properties of AA 2219 parent and weld specimens, at both ambient and cryogenic temperatures. It was found that reliable joints could be fabricated and there was no significant effect of grain size or aspect ratio on the mechanical properties of weld joints either at room temperature (300K) or at 77K.

AB Photocatalysis, as a technology for splitting water to produce hydrogen, has been paid more and more attention. However, the catalyst has fewer active sites and a fast carrier recombination rate resulting in lower activity. In this work, BiOBr-Ni with Ni single atoms and oxygen vacancies was prepared by the microwave - assisted method. The SEM results show that the BiOBr-Ni surface layer is composed of nano-sheets. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) indicates that the prepared BiOBr-Ni contains oxygen vacancies. XRD, XPS and spherical electron microscopy have proved that Ni exists in the form of single atom. In the process of photocatalytic hydrogen production, BiOBr-Ni showed excellent photocatalytic activity. DFT and experimental tests show that the improved photocatalytic hydrogen production is the joint action of oxygen vacancy and Ni single atom, which not only enhances the carrier separation efficiency but also greatly reduces the reaction energy barrier.

AB Background Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by the formation and deposition of calcium-containing crystals in joint tissues, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been implicated in mineralization but has never been studied in OA. Here, we investigated the role of the H2S-producing enzyme 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST) in cartilage calcification and OA development. Methods 3-MST expression was analyzed in cartilage from patients with different OA degrees, and in cartilage stimulated with hydroxyapatite (HA) crystals. The modulation of 3-MST expression in vivo was studied in the meniscectomy (MNX) model of murine OA, by comparing sham-operated to MNX knee cartilage. The role of 3-MST was investigated by quantifying joint calcification and cartilage degradation in WT and 3-MST-/- meniscectomized knees. Chondrocyte mineralization in vitro was measured in WT and 3-MST-/- cells. Finally, the effect of oxidative stress on 3-MST expression and chondrocyte mineralization was investigated. Results 3-MST expression in human cartilage negatively correlated with calcification and OA severity, and diminished upon HA stimulation. In accordance, cartilage from menisectomized OA knees revealed decreased 3-MST if compared to sham-operated healthy knees. Moreover, 3-MST-/- mice showed exacerbated joint calcification and OA severity if compared to WT mice. In vitro, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of 3-MST in chondrocytes resulted in enhanced mineralization and IL-6 secretion. Finally, oxidative stress decreased 3-MST expression and increased chondrocyte mineralization, maybe via induction of pro-mineralizing genes. Conclusion 3-MST-generated H2S protects against joint calcification and experimental OA. Enhancing H2S production in chondrocytes may represent a potential disease modifier to treat OA.

AB The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) has legislated and aims to be net zero emissions by 2045. Such ambitious targets have implications for the contribution of hydrogen and its storage in gas distribution networks Therefore, we need to understand now the impacts on the gas distribution network of the transition to 100% hydrogen. Assessment of the viability of decarbonising the ACT gas network will be partly based on the cost of reusing the gas network for the safe and reliable distribution of hydrogen. That task requires each element of the natural gas safety management system to be evaluated. This article describes the construction of a test facility in Canberra, Australia used to identify issues raised by 100% hydrogen use in the medium pressure distribution network, consisting of nylon and polyethylene (PE) as a means of identifying measures necessary to ensure ongoing validity of the network's regulatory safety case. Evoenergy (the ACT's gas distribution company) have constructed a Test Facility, incorporating an electrolyser, a gas supply pressure reduction and mixing skid a replica gas network and a domestic installation with gas appliances. Jointly with Australian National University (ANU) and Canberra Institute of Technology (CIT) the Company has commenced a program of "bench testing", initially with 100% hydrogen to identify gaps in the safety case specifically focusing on the materials, work practices and safety systems in the ACT. The facility is designed to assess: Materials in use including aged network materials and components Construction and installation techniques both greenfield and live gas work Purging and filling techniques Leak detection both underground and above ground Emergency response and make safe techniques Issues associated with use of hydrogen in light commercial and domestic appliances. To educate and train: Technicians and gas fitters on infrastructure installation and management Emergency response services on responding to hydrogen related emergencies in a network environment; and manage public perceptions of hydrogen in a network environment. Australia has an enviable safety record for the safe and reliable transport, distribution and use of natural gas. The ACT natural gas network owned and operated by Evoenergy is one of the newest in Australia and has leveraged off the best materials and practices in Australia to build its network. The paper addresses major safety issues relating to the production/storage, distribution and consumer end use of hydrogen injected into existing gas distribution networks. The analysis is guided by the Safety Management System. The Hydrogen Testing Facility described in the paper provide tools for evaluation of hydrogen safety matters in the ACT and Australia-wide. Testing to date has confirmed that polyethylene and nylon pipe and their respective jointing techniques can contain 100% hydrogen at pressures used for the distribution of natural gas. Testing has also confirmed that current installation work practices on polyethylene and nylon pipe and joints are suitable for hydrogen service. This finding is subject to variation attributable to staff training and skill levels and further testing has been programmed as outlined in this paper. Testing of gas isolation by clamping and simulated repair on the hydrogen network has established that standard natural gas isolation techniques work with 100% hydrogen at natural gas pressures.

AB Micro-alloy steels are broadly used in gas and petroleum transportation industries. However, application of these steels in pipelines is challenged by hydrogen embrittlement due to presence of hydrogen sulfide in the medium. The present work deals with the interaction of hydrogen with plasticity of X65 steel. Two weld joints produced by common E7010-G and E7018 electrodes via shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) method were also investigated. It was revealed in microhardness test that direct charge of hydrogen to the surface did not lead to meaningful variations due to lamination as well as surface and sub-surface porosities. In fact, the effect of hydrogen on material plasticity was influenced by lamination and porosities. On the other hand, indirect charge on the tested surface led to increase in hardness by 12%, 9% and 6% in base metal as well as in weld metals obtained from E7010-G and E7018 electrodes, respectively. Therefore, hydrogen atoms affected plasticity of X65 steel more harshly than that of weld metals; thus, the base metal is more sensitive to hydrogen embrittlement. Due to high strain rate, impact test does not provide sufficient time for hydrogen diffusion through notch during the test. No observation of any variations in impact energies of charged samples may hence be explained by uniform hydrogen concentration throughout the samples. The base steel was seen to be much more sensitive to hydrogen defects rather than weld metals of both electrodes due to possessing pearlite/ ferrite interfaces. According to hydrogen concentration studies, E710-G weld metal had more hydrogen diffusivity than X65 steel and E7018 weld metal by four time and 25%, respectively. This was due to acicular ferritic microstructure of E710-G weld metal and its dislocation tangles that provided many reversible traps for hydrogen.

AB With the transition towards a decarbonized society, energy system integration is becoming ever more essential. In this transition, the energy vector hydrogen is expected to play a key role as it can be produced from (renewable) power and natural gas with carbon capture and storage and utilized in a plethora of applications and processes across sectors. Despite global hydrogen demand reaching 94 million tonnes in 2021, still less than 0.7% of it is supplied by low-emission hydrogen. Moreover, to date hydrogen production is mostly located in close proximity to where it is used. In order to link future production and demand sites, it is planned to re-purpose existing natural gas and expand dedicated hydrogen pipelines. During the early stages of ramping up the hydrogen sector (2020s and early 2030s), however, blending natural gas with hydrogen for joint pipeline transmission has been suggested. Against this background, this paper studies hydrogen blending from a modeling perspective, both in terms of the implications of considering (or omitting) technical modeling details and in terms of the potential impact on the ramp-up of the hydrogen sector. To this end, we present a highly modular and flexible integrated sector-coupled energy system optimization model of the power, natural gas, and hydrogen sectors with a novel gas flow formulation for modeling blending in the context of steady-state gas flows. A stylized case study illustrates that hydrogen blending has the potential to initiate and to facilitate the ramp-up of the hydrogen sector under certain assumptions, while omitting the technical realities of gas flows - particularly in the context of blending - can result in suboptimal expansion planning not only in the hydrogen, but also in the power sector, as well as in an operationally infeasible system.

AB This paper describes a combined experimental, analytical and numerical modelling investigation into hydrogen jet fires in a passively ventilated enclosure. The work was funded by the EU Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking project Hyindoor. It is relevant to situations where hydrogen is stored or used indoors. In such situations passive ventilation can be used to prevent the formation of a flammable atmosphere following a release of hydrogen. Whilst a significant amount of work has been reported on unignited releases in passively ventilated enclosures and on outdoor hydrogen jet fires, very little is known about the behaviour of hydrogen jet fires in passively ventilated enclosures. This paper considers the effects of passive ventilation openings on the behaviour of hydrogen jet fires. A series of hydrogen jet fire experiments were carried out using a 31 m(3) passively ventilated enclosure. The test programme included subsonic and chocked flow releases with varying hydrogen release rates and vent configurations. In most of the tests the hydrogen release rate was sufficiently low and the vent area sufficiently large to lead to a well-ventilated jet fire. In a limited number of tests the vent area was reduced, allowing under-ventilated conditions to be investigated: The behaviour of a jet fire in a passively ventilated enclosure.depends on the hydrogen release rate, the vent area and the thermal properties of the enclosure. An analytical model was used to quantify the relative importance of the hydrogen release rate and vent area, whilst the influence of the thermal properties of the enclosure were investigated using a CFD model. Overall, the results indicate that passive ventilation openings that are sufficiently large to safely ventilate an unignited release will tend to be large enough to prevent a jet fire from becoming under-ventilated.

AB Urea (CN2H4O) is a fundamental biomolecule whose derivatives are abundant throughout chemistry. Among the latter, rubidium ureate (RbCN2H3O) and its cesium analog (CsCN2H3O) have been described only very recently and form the first structurally characterized salts of deprotonated urea. Here, we report on a neutron diffraction study on the aforementioned alkaline-metal ureates, which affords the positions for all hydrogen atoms (including full anisotropic displacement tensors) and thus allows us to gain fundamental insights into the hydrogen-bonding networks in the title compounds. The structure refinements of the experimental neutron data proceeded successfully using starting parameters from ab initio simulations of atomic positions and anisotropic displacement parameters. Such joint experimental-theoretical refinement procedures promise significant practical potential in cases where complex solids (organic, organometallic, framework materials) are studied by powder diffraction.

AB The potential of neutron powder diffraction (NPD) to provide vital information on the determination of accurate hydrogen positions in organic molecular crystals is demonstrated through the study of a series of hydrogen bonded molecular complexes with relevance in crystal engineering. By studying complexes designed to contain short, strong hydrogen bonds, the findings are shown to be of particular importance in the study of proton transfer, and the often critical distinction between neutral complexes and salts in these molecular materials. The use of combined NPD and single crystal X-ray diffraction is shown to be particularly potent in this area.

AB We observed the effect of hydrogen-rich medium on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), hyaline leukocyte conglutination, and permeability of the endothelium. Endotheliocytes were inoculated on 6-well plates and randomly divided into 4 groups: control, H-2, LPS, LPS+H-2, H-2, and LPS+H-2 in saturated hydrogen-rich medium. We applied Wright's staining to observe conglutination of hyaline leukocytes and HUVECs, flow cytometry to determine the content of vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), enzymelinked immunosorbent assay to measure the E-selectin concentration in the cell liquor, the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) to test the permeability of endothelial cells, and Western blot and immunofluorescence to test the expression and distribution of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin. Compared with control cells, there was an increase in endothelium-hyaline leukocyte conglutination, a reduction in VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin, and the TEER value increased obviously. Compared with LPS, there was an obvious reduction in the conglutination of LPS+H-2 cells, a reduction in VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin levels, and a reduction in the TEER-resistance value, while the expression of VE-cadherin increased. Fluorescence results showed that, compared with control cells, the VE-cadherin in LPS cells was incomplete at the cell joints. Compared with LPS cells, the VE-cadherin in LPS+H-2 cells was even and complete at the cell joints. Liquid rich in hydrogen could reduce LPS-induced production of adhesion molecules and endothelium-hyaline leukocyte conglutination, and influence the expression and distribution of VE-cadherin to regulate the permeability of the endothelium.

AB This paper presents a high-efficiency and high-fidelity approach to model supersonic combustion using the extended flamelet-generated manifold (FGM) and the Eulerian transported probability density function (PDF), also known as the Eulerian stochastic fields (ESF) method. The efficiency benefits from the FGM, where the compressibility effects induced by shock waves are considered using two extra control variables, i.e., the pressure (p) and the absolute internal energy of the oxidizer (Eox), in addition to the mixture fraction (Z) and progress variable (Y) in traditional flamelet tables. The joint PDF for these control variables is modeled using transported PDF based on the ESF method. The ESF method enhances accuracy in the prediction of turbulence-chemistry interactions, avoiding complexity induced by the presumed PDF in the flamelet table and ad-hoc presumed and independent joint PDF assumptions, e.g., the typical presumed /3-PDF for Z and S-PDF for Y. This FGM-ESF method is tested in large eddy simulations of two canonical hydrogen supersonic flames: a strut-stabilized hydrogen supersonic flame (DLR case) and a transverse hydrogen jet flame in a high-enthalpy incoming flow (Stanford case). For both cases, results show that including the compressibility effects in the FGM table is essential for properly describing the flame behaviors near shock waves. The sub-grid PDF of control variables significantly influences near-wall and shear-layer combustion, and the ESF method demonstrates superior performance in predicting the near-wall reaction zone and the shear-layer reaction zone compared to the perfectly micro-mixed sub-grid model (S-PDF) for the Stanford case. This study marks the first application of the FGM-ESF approach with a Z-Y-Eox-p FGM table to simulate supersonic flames, offering a novel perspective for future modeling efforts in this domain. Novelty and Significance Statement The novelty of this research lies in the development and application of an efficient computational approach that for the first time couples the extended flamelet-generated manifold (FGM) method with the Eulerian stochastic fields (ESF) to simulate supersonic flames. This combined FGM-ESF method incorporates pressure and oxidizer energy as additional control variables in the FGM tabulation to account for compressibility effects. The ESF is used to describe the sub-grid scale joint probability density function without relying on complex presumed functions. Application to a canonical strut-stabilized hydrogen supersonic flame and transverse hydrogen jet flames in a high-enthalpy incoming flow demonstrate the superior predictive capabilities of the FGM-ESF method in capturing flame dynamics. The comparison between four-dimensional and twodimensional FGM tables provides new insights into the importance of compressibility effects for these configurations.

AB Hydrogen storage in the solid state represents one of the most attractive and challenging ways to supply hydrogen to a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell. Although in the last 15 years a large variety of material systems have been identified as possible candidates for storing hydrogen, further efforts have to be made in the development of systems which meet the strict targets of the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Recent projections indicate that a system possessing: (i) an ideal enthalpy in the range of 20-50 kJ/mol H-2, to use the heat produced by PEM fuel cell for providing the energy necessary for desorption; (ii) a gravimetric hydrogen density of 5 wt. % H-2 and (iii) fast sorption kinetics below 110 degrees C is strongly recommended. Among the known hydrogen storage materials, amide and imide-based mixtures represent the most promising class of compounds for on-board applications; however, some barriers still have to be overcome before considering this class of material mature for real applications. In this review, the most relevant progresses made in the recent years as well as the kinetic and thermodynamic properties, experimentally measured for the most promising systems, are reported and properly discussed.

AB To achieve the sustainability goals set for the European aviation sector, hydrogen-powered solutions are currently being investigated. Storage solutions are of particular interest, with liquid hydrogen tanks posing numerous challenges with regard to the structural integrity of materials at cryogenic temperatures, as well as safety issues because of the high flammability of hydrogen. In this context and in the scope of the Horizon 2020 Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking (CAJU) project H2ELIOS, the gas permeability behavior of prepreg tape carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) material was studied. Investigations were performed after thermal shock to 20 K (liquid hydrogen immersion) as well as after a uniaxial stress application at 77 K to identify the shift from Fickian behavior after diverse aging conditions. Helium gas permeation was tested at room temperature (RT), and its representativeness to hydrogen permeation in a range of temperatures was considered in the study. The material's permeation behavior was compared to ideal Fickian diffusion as a means of identifying related permeation barrier function degradation. Finally, it was possible to identify Fickian, near-Fickian, and non-Fickian behaviors and correlate them with the material's preconditioning.

AB CdS/TiO2 composite photoanode has attracted great attention due to its favorable electronic and optical properties. In this work, nanostructured Si-doped TiO2 photoanodes modified with CdS were fabricated through anodization of Ti-5Si alloy and depositing CdS by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) process. The composition and morphology, optical properties and photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of the composite photoanodes were investigated. The CdS/600-TiSiO composite photoanode with donor density of 2.2 x 1019 cm-3 and flat-band potential of -0.215 V exhibited excellent PEC hydrogen generation properties with remarkable photocurrent density (7.86 mA cm-2 at 0 V vs Ag/AgCl), which was 19.15 times and 9.59 times to that of undoped TiO2 photoanode and Ti-Si-O photoanode, respectively. The joint employment of Si-doping and CdS deposition provided an effective method to prepare excellent photocatalysts for PEC hydrogen generation. (c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB The development of 100% renewable energy (RE) systems provides a viable solution for achieving the global target of carbon neutrality. To support the reliable and economical operation of RE -based local energy networks, this paper presents a joint scheduling model for grid -scale RE generation and hydrogen -based flexible loads. The direct load control (DLC) through hydrogen -electrical microgrids is analytically modeled for leveraging the intrinsic flexibility of demand -side multi -energy synergy. To handle the uncertainty and volatility of RE generation, a risk -averse stochastic programming method with the receding -horizon mechanism is developed. Also, the power balancing cost in scheduling objectives is represented as a conditional value -atrisk (CVaR) measure to control the risks of fully RE supply. Case studies on an exemplary RE system confirm the effectiveness and economic benefits of the proposed method. The hydrogen -enabled DLC can largely mitigate the supply-demand mismatches, which shows a great potential to facilitate 100% RE scenarios.

AB In general, wind power output of clustering wind farms must be massively transmitted. The wind power in each wind farm is correlated, intermittent, fluctuant, and cannot be accommodated all the time, causing the intractable decision of economical transmission capacity of a project transmitting wind power to a power grid. Furthermore, the drastic fluctuation of clustered wind power results in enormous challenges regarding the safety of a power system. For these reasons, the concept of a wind-hydrogen power system for clustered wind farms is proposed. Next, a multiobjective model for optimizing the capacities, including the transmission project, hydrogen-producing system, and fuel cells, is constructed based on the joint distributed character of wind speed, which consists of maximizing social benefit and the qualified rate of smoothing clustering wind power fluctuations. Finally, a case is analyzed in detail, accounting for the wind volatility, wind curtailment probability, and the costs of both hydrogen production and the fuel cells.

AB Hydrogen energy represents a crucial pathway towards achieving carbon neutrality and is a pivotal facet of future strategic emerging industries. The safe and efficient transportation of hydrogen is a key link in the entire chain development of the hydrogen energy industry's "production, storage, and transportation". Mixing hydrogen into natural gas pipelines for transportation is the potential best way to achieve large-scale, long-distance, safe, and efficient hydrogen transportation. Welds are identified as the vulnerable points in natural gas pipelines, and compatibility between hydrogen-doped natural gas and existing pipeline welds is a critical technical challenge that affects the global-scale transportation of hydrogen energy. Therefore, this article systematically discusses the construction and weld characteristics of hydrogen-doped natural gas pipelines, the research status of hydrogen damage mechanism, and mechanical property strengthening methods of hydrogen-doped natural gas pipeline welds, and points out the future development direction of hydrogen damage mechanism research in hydrogen-doped natural gas pipeline welds. The research results show that: (1) Currently, there is a need for comprehensive research on the degradation of mechanical properties in welds made from typical pipe materials on a global scale. It is imperative to systematically elucidate the mechanism of mechanical property degradation due to conventional and hydrogen-induced damage in welds of high-pressure hydrogen-doped natural gas pipelines worldwide. (2) The deterioration of mechanical properties in welds of hydrogen-doped natural gas pipelines is influenced by various components, including hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. It is necessary to reveal the mechanism of mechanical property deterioration of pipeline welds under the joint participation of multiple damage mechanisms under multi-component gas conditions. (3) Establishing a fundamental database of mechanical properties for typical pipeline steel materials under hydrogen-doped natural gas conditions globally is imperative, to form a method for strengthening the mechanical properties of typical high-pressure hydrogen-doped natural gas pipeline welds. (4) It is essential to promptly develop relevant standards for hydrogen blending transportation, welding technology, as well as weld evaluation, testing, and repair procedures for natural gas pipelines.

The corrosion rate was found to increase, in order, Al base metal (BM-6N01) < Mg base metal (BM-AZ31B) < stirred zone. The galvanic coupling of the Mg phase to the other phases enhanced the corrosion of both BM-AZ31B and BM-6N01. Accompanying the intense corrosion at BM-AZ31B, water reduction on the cathodic particles of BM-6N01 elevated the interfacial pH to a level where the Al matrix corroded to AlO2-.

AB The storage of hydrogen gas in lined rock caverns (LRCs) may enable the implementation of the first large-scale fossil-free steelmaking process in Sweden, but filling such storage causes joints in the rock mass to open, concentrating strains in the lining. The structural interaction between the LRC components must be able to reduce the strain concentration in the sealing steel lining; however, this interaction is complex and difficult to predict with analytical methods. In this paper, the strain concentration in LRCs from the opening of rock joints is studied using finite element (FE) analyses, where the large- and small-scale deformation behaviors of the LRC are coupled. The model also includes concrete crack initiation and development with increasing gas pressure and rock joint width. The interaction between the jointed rock mass and the reinforced concrete, the sliding layer, and the steel lining is demonstrated. The results show that the rock mass quality and the spacing of the rock joints have the greatest influence on the strain distributions in the steel lining. The largest effect of rock joints on the maximum strains in the steel lining was observed for geological conditions of "good" quality rock masses.

AB Chemical looping gasification (CLG) has become a popular method for producing hydrogen-rich syngas due to its environment-friendliness. Recently, a method of using industrial solid waste carbide slag as an oxygen carrier, hydrogen carrier, and in-situ carbon capture agent in the CLG process has been proposed. However, the actual experiment was affected by heat and mass transfer, and the detailed reaction pathway of the carbide slag was not fully understood. In the present study, the process of the CLG process for producing hydrogen-rich syngas with lignite and carbide slag was analyzed using tube furnace experiments, FactSage calculations, and joint charac-teristic experiment of carbide slag. The result showed that to achieve a gas phase product with a hydrogen concentration exceeding 90 vol% (with dry N2 excluded), a molar ratio of lignite to carbide slag of greater than 1:5 and a reaction temperature of 923 K should be maintained. In terms of the reaction pathway of carbide slag in the CLG process, it was revealed that calcium hydroxide, the primary component of carbide slag, directly participated in the reaction at temperatures of less than 773 K.

AB The underground storage of hydrogen (H2) in porous formations is considered a part of the global strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion into the atmosphere. Although injection of fluids into reservoir rocks has been a common practice, the unique properties of H2 and the ubiquitous spatial variability of hydraulic medium properties require a new understanding of the multiphase flow processes involved in underground hydrogen storage. In this paper, we focus on the joint impact that spatial medium heterogeneity and hysteresis on relative permeability, as a result of capillary trapping, have on hydrogen geostorage. We present an integrated study that uses detailed 2D numerical simulations of cyclic hydrogen-brine displacement in heterogeneous anticlinal aquifers to evaluate the amount of trapped hydrogen and the reversibility of the water-hydrogen system. We find that the intensity and spatial correlation of heterogeneity in rock porosity and permeability significantly enhance the trapping potential of capillary forces. In addition to increasing the amount of trapped hydrogen, the intensity of heterogeneity also increases the number of injection-production cycles before a reversible operation mode can be achieved. Depending on the degree of heterogeneity, the amount of trapped hydrogen may be twice that of an equivalent homogeneous storage formation. We find that these effects can be mitigated by decreasing the length of injection-production cycles. Thus, the interaction between relative permeability hysteresis and spatial heterogeneity in the hydraulic medium properties plays a key role in the design and deployment of underground hydrogen storage in aquifers.

AB The process of creating a physical and mathematical model of the hydrogen permeability of a hollow cylinder, depending on the level, sign and nature of the distribution of internal stresses on the example of electrochemical alloys synthesized by electrolysis, is shown. For the concentration fields of hydrogen atoms, the corresponding analytical dependences are used, which are the basis for mathematical modeling of diffusion processes and demonstrate the possibility of controlling the hydrogen permeability of metals. It is shown that the hydrogen permeability of a hollow cylinder primarily depends on the level and nature of the distribution of internal stresses (tensile and compressive). Internal stresses with a logarithmic dependence on coordinates have a single mathematical description, and the use of the principle of superposition allows you to display a picture of the joint interactions of the fields of internal stresses of various origins. The mathematical interpretation of internal stresses in crystals is reduced to the introduction of some dimensionless parameters, which are easily calculated and algebraically summed. This allows the model to demonstrate the possibility of parametric control of internal stresses in alloys. The mathematical model of the diffusion process for a medium with the formation and decay of immovable metal-impurity-hydrogen complexes is presented taking into account the probabilities of their formation and decay.

AB The utilization of hydrogen-powered vehicles as an alternative to fossil-fueled ones has been identified as a promising solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To promote the deployment of hydrogen-powered vehicles, however, it is imperative that hydrogen refueling stations with on-site electricity-produced hydrogen (eHRSs) are economically utilized for concurrent services. Therefore, this article proposes a new estimation-based method for the optimal scheduling of eHRS for the provision of congestion management services to the distribution system. The method allows for real-time adaptive management of the congestion level in the feeder as decided by the distribution system operator. A new correlation-based method is proposed for online estimation of the amount of congestion and determination of the eHRSs setpoints to relieve congestion on the distribution feeders. This article also develops a congestion management pricing mechanism for the compensation of eHRSs that serve the distribution grid. Numerical results indicate how distribution feeder congestion can be adaptively managed, while the financial profile of the eHRSs is improved via joint application and provision of concurrent services to the transportation sector and grid operator.

AB In order to maximise European, national and regional research and innovation potential the European Union is investing in these fields through different funding mechanisms such as the ESIF or H2020 programme. This investment plan is part of the European 2020 strategy, where the concept of Smart Specialisation is also included.
   Smart Specialisation is an innovation policy concept designed to promote the efficient and effective use of public investment in regional innovation in order to achieve economic growth. The Smart Specialisation Platform was created to support this concept by assisting regions and Member States in developing, implementing and reviewing their research and innovation Smart Specialisation strategies. The Smart Specialisation Platform comprises several thematic platforms.
   The thematic Smart Specialisation Platform on energy (S3PEnergy) is a joint initiative of three European Commission services: DG REGIO, DG ENER, and the Joint Research Centre (JRC). The main objective of the S3PEnergy is to support the optimal and effective uptake of the Cohesion Policy funds for energy, and to better align energy innovation activities at national, local and regional level through the identification of the technologies and innovative solutions that support in the most cost-effective way the EU energy policy priorities.
   In the particular case of hydrogen technologies, the activities of the platform are mainly focused on supporting the new Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU) initiative involving regions and cities. To date, more than 80 European cities and regions have committed to participate in this initiative through the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding, and more participants are expected to join. S3PEnergy is helping in the identification of potential combination of H2020 funding (provided through FCH JU) and ESIF.
   To identify potential synergies among these two funding sources, a mapping of the different ESIF opportunities has been performed. In order to map these opportunities, Operational Programmes (OPs) and research and innovation strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3) of the different European regions and Member States were analysed. The results of this mapping and analysis are presented in this paper. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB The multiple mortise-and-tenon joint parts are the core factors to provide the structural stability and diversity of Chinese Luban locks; however, constructing such structures is very challenging. Herein, single crystals of a covalent organic nanoribbon (named CityU-27) are prepared through the assembly of hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP), 4,4 '-vinylenedipyridine (BYE), and phenylboronic acid (BA) together through dative boron <- nitrogen (B <- N) bonds. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that CityU-27 has a covalent organic nanoribbon structure, where each nanoribbon forms multiple and tight pi-pi interactions with four neighboring others to generate a Luban lock-like configuration. CityU-27 has been demonstrated to be an efficient photocatalyst in a one-pot tandem reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and semi-hydrogenation reaction of alkynes in series to produce olefins without any additional photosensitizers and co-catalysts (metal-free).
   The single-crystal structure of a covalent organic nanoribbon (named CityU-27) with a width of ca. 6 nm has been shown to exhibit a multiple "mortise-and-tenon" like joint 3D network similar to the Chinese traditional Luban lock configuration. CityU-27 has been demonstrated to be an efficient photocatalyst in the metal-free one-pot tandem hydrogen evolution reaction and semi-hydrogenation reaction of diphenylacetylene derivatives. image

AB Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a kind of inflammation homeostasis disorder that dysfunctions the joints. Clinically, medications against RA focus simply on mitigating the focal inflammation, without considering pro-osteogenesis re-modeling of the bone microenvironment. In the present work, 2D layered calcium disilicide nanoparticles (CSNs) are fabricated by facile aqueous exfoliation. The hydrolysis of CSNs produces anti-oxidative H2, alkaline Ca(OH)2, and silica. These moieties play significant roles in anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation, and pro-osteogenesis resulting in considerably better RA therapeutic consequences than anti-inflammation alone. Hydrogen gas is validated to eliminate excessive hydroxyl radicals and regulate macrophage re-polarization; the generated Ca(OH)2 can neutralize the acidic microenvironment and inhibit the osteoclast activity; and, the dissolved Ca2+ can effectively complex with phosphates to mineralize Ca3(PO4)2, promoting the osteogenesis of the focal joint. The multifunctional performances of CSNs are further confirmed in arthritic mouse and rabbit models, providing an advanced and robust therapeutic strategy against RA with high biocompatibility and clinical transformable promises.

TI THE PHENOMENON OF HYDROGEN EMBRITTLEMENT IN HIGH-STRENGTH BOLTS
SO ARCHIVES OF METALLURGY AND MATERIALS

DE cold forging; hydrogen embrittlement; high -strength bolts
AB The hydrogen embrittlement of metals is caused by the penetration and accumulation of hydrogen atoms inside the metal. The failure of the product due to hydrogen embrittlement is delayed in time and does not occur immediately after its manufacture, but several hours, days, or even weeks later. Therefore, the chances of detecting hydrogen embrittlement when checking the quality of the finished product are very slim. The use of high-strength bolts in industry is associated with the risk of hydrogen embrittlement. This phenomenon poses a threat to the safe use of devices by limiting or completely losing the functionality of the bolt joint. Even a low influence of moisture can trigger failure mechanisms. The article proposes a method for assessing the risk of hydrogen embrittlement for high-strength bolts in class12.9. For this purpose, bolts made of material grade 32CrB4 were prepared and in a controlled manner the grain flow inconsistency was made, leading in extreme cases to the production of the forging lap. To perform the study, the device proposed by the European Assessment Document (EAD) was adapted to the testing of hydrogen embrittlement of threaded fasteners in concrete. The concrete substrate was replaced with metal spacers that were preloaded with a bolt. The use of the wedge distance under the bolt head led to the generation of two stress states - tensile and compressive, which translated into an increased risk of hydrogen embrittlement. After being tested, the bolts were visually and microscopically inspected to assess potential locations for cracks and hydrogen propagation. As a result of the conducted tests, it was found that the prepared test method allows to assess the resistance or susceptibility of the bolt to threats related to hydrogen embrittlement.

AB Dissimilar joining of NiTi and stainless steel (SS) is important in biomedical applications but poses significant challenges due to brittle intermetallic compounds (IMCs) formation in the welds. Replacing harmful phases in fusion welding cannot fully eliminate brittle IMCs and may introduce toxic elements, while the mixing restriction in solid-state welding increases the process complexity and results in large plastic deformation that degrades NiTi functional properties. In this work, we present a novel methodology that achieves a solid-state joined interface in NiTi-SS fusion welding (i.e., resistance microwelding) through in-situ interfacial liquid control. By combining the advantages of both welding techniques, the current method produced NiTi-SS joints with superior strength, superelasticity and biocompatibility compared to NiTi joints or base metal. The ultrathin reaction layer at the solid-state joined interface contributed to a strong metallurgical bonding, while Joule heating effects and interfacial reactions enhanced superelasticity and biocompatibility of the joint. By demonstrating complete superelasticity on NiTi side, flexible deformation capacity on SS side, superior resistance to hydrogen embrittlement and electrochemical corrosion, and reduced Ni ion release and cytotoxicity, the welded joint shows great potential for the fabrication of multifunctional biomedical devices. Our work not only provides a comprehensive study of NiTi-SS joining under the biomedical background, but also introduces a new strategy for controlling material interface and dissimilar-metal welding process.

AB Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common articular chronic disease. However, its current treatment is limited and mostly symptomatic. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous gas with recognized physiological activities. The purpose here was to evaluate the effects of the intraarticular administration of a slow-releasing H2S compound (GYY-4137) on an OA experimental model. OA was induced in Wistar rats by the transection of medial collateral ligament and the removal of the medial meniscus of the left joint. The animals were randomized into three groups: non-treated and intraarticularly injected with saline or GYY-4137. Joint destabilization induced articular thickening (approximate to 5% increment), the loss of joint mobility and flexion (approximate to 12-degree angle), and increased levels of pain (approximate to 1.5 points on a scale of 0 to 3). Animals treated with GYY-4137 presented improved motor function of the joint, as well as lower pain levels (approximate to 75% recovery). We also observed that cartilage deterioration was attenuated in the GYY-4137 group (approximate to 30% compared with the saline group). Likewise, these animals showed a reduced presence of pro-inflammatory mediators (cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and metalloproteinase-13) and lower oxidative damage in the cartilage. The increment of the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) levels and Nrf-2-regulated gene expression (approximate to 30%) in the GYY-4137 group seem to be underlying its chondroprotective effects. Our results suggest the beneficial impact of the intraarticular administration of H2S on experimental OA, showing a reduced cartilage destruction and oxidative damage, and supporting the use of slow H2S-producing molecules as a complementary treatment in OA.

AB The stress corrosion cracking behaviour of laser MIG-hybrid welded 7B05-T5 aluminum alloy joint was studied by using pre-cracked wedge-open loading (WOL) specimens immersed in 3.5 %NaCl solution. The critical stress intensity factor for stress corrosion cracking (K-ISCC), and the cracks propagation rate (da/dt) were determined. The stress corrosion cracking propagation mechanism of welded joints was analyzed by fracture scanning and microstructure analysis. The results illustrated that both the base metal (BM) and the heat-affected zone (HAZ) were susceptible to stress corrosion cracking (SCC), but the weld zone (WZ) was not sensitive to SCC. The fracture mode of the aluminum alloy in SCC appeared the intergranular and transgranular mixed fracture. It was considered that the coaction of anodic dissolution and hydrogen embritt-lement contributed to SCC.

AB The concept of solar-hydrogen systems for spacecraft, orbital stations, lunar and Martian bases is currently receiving a new impetus. The supply of solar energy to energy receivers aboard space vehicles is limited. The number of everyday tasks and energy-intensive experiments on board space objects is growing with the development of astronautics. To perform energy-intensive work and experiments, energy consumption exceeds the incoming solar fluxes. The modern solar-hydrogen system ensures the reception, conversion and accumulation of excess incoming energy in the form of chemical energy hydrogen. Cryogenics makes it possible to miniaturize the solar-hydrogen system. The safety of the cryogenic solar-hydrogen energy system is ensured by hydrogen concentration and leakage sensors. The article proposes a comprehensive solution for miniaturization of Power Conversion Unit (PCU) of Energy Power System (EPS) of spacecrafts (SC), which consists in a joint solution of four key problems of miniaturization of power devices: energy, structural, design and technological, system. Miniaturization of the solar-hydrogen energy system (SHES) is achieved by installing onboard hydrogen and oxygen microcryogenic refrigerators, as well as hydrogen and oxygen cryogenic tanks, water tank, electrolyzer and hydrogen fuel cells (FC). The accumulation of chemical hydrogen energy on board the orbiting spacecraft ensures reliable operation when entering the shadow. Storage of hydrogen in cryogenic form significantly reduces the volume required. A cryocooler based on the Stirling cycle provides the process of liquefying hydrogen after the electrolysis of distilled water. In addition, cryogenic temperatures of 20.2 K can be used to thermostat precision instruments placed on board the spacecraft, For example, to ensure the operation of the SQUID. A 3D - model of a voltage stabilization module (VSM), on the basis of which EEC can be produced with different output power and redundancy depth. We give an example of a complete structural scheme of the EEC, which allows implementing all the fulfillment of all the tasks, assigned to the EEC of the PCU SC.

AB The present work presents a novel approach of employing two renewable energy sources for power and liquefied hydrogen cogeneration. Meanwhile, the main scheme comprises a biomass-fed (municipal solid waste) Brayton cycle using a digester, a geothermal-based flash binary cycle, and a Claude cycle for hydrogen liquefaction; the heat recovery is also performed through either an organic Rankine cycle (case A) or a Kalina cycle (case B) joint to the main scheme having two different configurations. Regarding the waste-to-energy framework designed for high performance, the system is comprehensively studied and optimized from the energy, exergy, and economic aspects. In this regard, thermodynamic-and economic-based sensitivity analysis, net present value method, and multi-objective grey wolf optimi-zation are implemented; the multi-criteria optimization is performed in three scenarios containing exergy efficiency-NPV, exergy efficiency-liquefied hydrogen's unit cost, and NPV-liquefied hydrogen cost. According to the results, the first scenario offers higher exergetic efficiency; the third scenario also provides a better hydrogen cost. As a result, the better optimum exergetic efficiency and liquefied hydrogen cost are equal to 10.95% and 3.84 $/kg for case A, and 10.38% and 3.74 $/kg for case B.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, a sequentially coupling finite element analysis (PEA) program was utilized to simulate the welding temperature and predict the residual stress in the weld and Heat Affect Zone (HAZ) between the nozzle and the head. The results of a numerical calculation indicated that complex residual stresses were generated and concentrated in the weld and HAZ. Due to the existence of the interlayer gap between the two layers of the head, discontinuous stress distributions occurred. There were several sections where there are stress concentrations because of the discontinuous structure. The influences of welding heat input and preheating temperature were also investigated in this study. When the preheating temperature increased, the peak residual stresses in the structure decreased. The welding heat input had little effect on the residual stresses. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 2219 aluminum alloy has a series of advantages, such as good mechanical properties, stress corrosion resistance, welding performance, low hot crack tendency, and is widely used in the aerospace field. In the process of evaluating the welding process performance of 2219 aluminum alloy, it was found that the high porosity was proved to be the main weakness of the joint quality of AC TIG welding. The Straight Polarity Direct Current (DCSP) TIG welding process of 2219 aluminum alloy is realized by removing the oxide film on the surface of aluminum alloy with activating flux. The outstanding feature is that the internal porosity of TIG weld is effectively reduced, and the welding quality is improved. Therefore, the mechanism of activating flux to remove the internal porosity of 2219 aluminum alloy DCSP TIG welding was studied. The results show that DCSP TIG welding arc is stable, and the activating flux covers the weld pool surface, which can protect the weld pool and reduce the hydrogen solubility in the weld pool. The infrared thermal imager is used to measure the temperature of the welding joint. The coating of activating flux can increase the heat input of the DCSP TIG welding joint. The increase of the welding heat input reduces the solidification speed of the molten pool, increases the existence time of the molten pool, and hydrogen bubbles have enough time to escape from the molten pool. Through the analysis of the force on the surface of the molten pool, it can be seen that the coating of activating flux increases the heat input of the TIG welding joint. The greater the heat input, the stronger the effect of Lorentz force and plasma force on the molten pool, thus changing the movement direction of the metal in the molten pool, which is conducive to the bubble floating, and effectively inhibits the generation of weld porosity.

AB This paper describes a methodology for simulating the structural response of vented enclosures during hydrogen deflagrations. The paper also summarises experimental results for the structural response of 20-foot ISO (International Organization for Standardization) containers in a series of vented hydrogen deflagration experiments. The study is part of the project Improving hydrogen safety for energy applications through pre-normative research on vented deflagrations (HySEA). The project is funded by the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking under grant agreement No 671461. The HySEA project focuses on vented hydrogen deflagrations in containers and smaller enclosures with internal congestion representative of industrial applications. The structural response modelling involves one-way coupling of pressure loads taken either directly from experiments or from simulations with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool FLACS to the non-linear finite element (FE) IMPETUS Afea Solver. The performance of the FE model is evaluated for a range of experiments from the HySEA project in both small-scale enclosures and 20-foot ISO containers. The paper investigates the sensitivity of results from the FE model to the specific properties of the geometry model. The performance of FLACS is evaluated for a selected set of experiments from the HySEA project. Furthermore, the paper discusses uncertainties associated with the combined modelling approach.

AB Hydrogen technologies have received increased attention in research and development to foster the shift towards carbon-neutral energy systems. Depending on the specific production techniques, transportation concepts, and application areas, hydrogen supply chains (HSCs) can be anything from part of the energy transition problem to part of the solution: Even more than battery-driven electric mobility, hydrogen is a polyvalent technology and can be used in very different contexts with specific positive or negative sustainability impacts. Thus, a detailed sustainability evaluation is crucial for decision making in the context of hydrogen technology and its diverse application fields. This article provides a comprehensive, structured literature review in the context of HSCs along the triple bottom line dimensions of environmental, economic, and social sustainability, analyzing a total of 288 research papers. As a result, we identify research gaps mostly regarding social sustainability and the supply chain stages of hydrogen distribution and usage. We suggest further research to concentrate on these gaps, thus strengthening our understanding of comprehensive sustainability evaluations for HSCs, especially in social sustainability evaluation. In addition, we provide an additional approach for discussion by adding literature review results from neighboring fields, highlighting the joint challenges and insights regarding sustainability evaluation.

AB In this work, we propose a novel data-driven framework for detailed kinetic mechanisms optimization applying the heuristic algorithm, namely canonic Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The PSO is more effective and robust in coping with uncertainties and incomplete information than deterministic and probabilistic optimization algorithms and is more suitable for machine learning applications. In the proposed framework, to avoid trapping in a local minimum, 1000 local optimums have been obtained and statistically handled to select the final feasible model parameter set with reduced uncertainty intervals and parameter correlations. The developed framework was successfully used for the optimization of the joint H2 and syngas oxidation chemical kinetic model. The data set collected for the model optimization includes 41 reactions and 16 species, and 3000 experimental data targets supplied with uncertainty boundaries measured in shock tubes, jet stirred reactors, plug flow reactors, and premixed laminar flames under wide ranges of temperature, pressure, equivalence ratio, and H2/CO ratios. The initially estimated uncertainties of the reaction rate constants for 15 key reactions were significantly constrained. The reaction rate constants for the H2 oxidation sub-model were re-optimized and their uncertainties were further reduced.

AB This paper compares two approaches for predicting the consequences of vented hydrogen deflagrations: empirical engineering models (EMs) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The study is part of the project 'Improving hydrogen safety for energy applications through pre-normative research on vented deflagrations' (HySEA), funded by the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking (FCH JU) under grant agreement No 671461. The HySEA project focuses on vented hydrogen deflagrations in containers and smaller enclosures with internal congestion representative of industrial applications. Data from experiments conducted as part of the HySEA project are used to evaluate predictions from a selection of EMs and the CFD tool FLACS. The experiments involve various obstacle and venting configurations, and initially quiescent homogeneous hydrogen-air mixtures with hydrogen concentrations in the range 15-24 vol%. There is a significant scatter in the maximum reduced overpressures predicted by the different EMs in the present study. For certain configurations, there is an order of magnitude difference between the different EM predictions. Two versions of the CFD tool FLAGS are used in the present study: i) the standard commercial release FLAGS v10.7r2, and an in-house development version termed FLAGS-beta. The commercial release generally over-predicts the maximum overpressures measured in the experiments, while the development version of FLAGS gives improved results for several configurations.

AB Joining materials with different physicochemical properties presents significant challenges. This study investigates the one-step anodization of aluminum in a mixed phosphoric acid and hydrogen peroxide solution, followed by the direct injection molding of polymer resin to enhance joint properties. The anodizing treatment is performed at constant electrical current with phosphoric acid solutions of various concentrations. Phosphoric acid anodizing enables the formation of 3D channeling pore structure with micropits and uniform nanopores on the aluminum surface. Hydrogen peroxide acts as an oxidizing agent and promotes the dissolution reaction, thereby increasing the size of the nanopores. Larger pores facilitated the penetration of polymer resin into the aluminum oxide layer during injection molding, resulting in bonding strengths up to 40.34 MPa. This improvement is substantial when compared to the bonding strengths achieved through conventional injection molding processes. These results highlight that the increase in nanopore size due to hydrogen peroxide addition played a critical role in enhancing the bonding strength, as it facilitated better penetration and interlocking of the polymer resin within the anodized aluminum layer. Furthermore, a three-dimensional (3D) printing process was able to join polymer resins to the anodized aluminum surface, where the larger nanopores with the addition of the hydrogen peroxide is more beneficial to the bonding strengths than the direct injection molding is. This alternative approach addresses the environmental issues associated with the use of Cr(VI)-based anodizing solutions and the lightweight composites with applicability to various industries that could be produced using this method.

AB This paper gives an overview of the ongoing Joint Research Project (JRP) 20IND11 " Metrology infrastructure for high pressure gas and liquefied hydrogen flows " (MetHyInfra), which will ensure traceability in the hydrogen distribution chain. For this purpose, very precise nozzles with well-defined geometries have been produced. In this project, Critical Flow Venturi Nozzles (CFVNs) will be traceably calibrated for the first time with hydrogen and pressures up to 100 MPa using a Coriolis Flow Meter (CFM) as a secondary standard. A CFM has been successfully calibrated with hydrogen against a gravimetric primary standard. Equations of State (EoS) are important for the high-pressure calibration of the nozzles, but also for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. With regard to CFD, a numerical model has been developed to simulate high pressure hydrogen flow in the CFVN. In a parameter study, non -ideal nozzle shapes are investigated using a shape variation parameter. New Speed of Sound (SoS) measurements were conducted at temperatures from 273 to 323 K and pressures from 1 to 100 MPa. These new data were then used to develop a new EoS for normal hydrogen, optimized for gas phase calculations. In addition to gaseous hydrogen, the project has a strong focus on liquefied hydrogen. Here a three -pronged approach allows traceable measurements. Each of the approaches presented is based on a unique flow calibration principle and relies on independent traceability schemes. The results of the project will ensure traceable measurements and thus a higher level of confidence among end users.

AB Chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGVHD) is the leading cause of late non-relapse mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(HSCT). There is no standard therapy for patients refractory or dependent to corticosteroid treatment. We hypothesized that hydrogen may exert therapeutic effects on cGVHD patients with few side effects. A prospective open-label phase 2 study of hydrogen was conducted. Patients received hydrogen-rich water 4ml/kg orally three times a day. Responses were graded in the skin, mouth, Gastrointestinal(GI), liver, eyes, lungs and joints and fascia every 3 months. A total of 24 patients (median age 27) were enrolled. Of the 24 patients, 18 (75%; 95% CI, 55.1% to 88%) had an objective response. No significant toxicity was observed. The estimated 4-year overall survival rate was 74.7%(95% CI, 54.9%-94.5%). The survival time was significantly prolonged in the response group. The survival rate at 4 years in the response group is significantly higher than the nonresponse group (86.6% vs 0%; p= 0.000132). Hydrogen showed great efficacy on cGVHD patients and long-term administration of hydrogen was not associated with significant toxic effects. The trial was registered at www.ClinicalTrials.Gov, NCT02918188.

DE Hydrogen deflagration; Pressurized release; Hydrogen stratification
AB University of Pisa performed hydrogen releases and deflagrations in a 1.14 m(3) test facility, which shape and dimensions resemble a gas cabinet. Tests were performed for the HySEA project, founded by the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking with the aim to conduct pre-normative research on vented deflagrations in enclosures and containers used for hydrogen energy applications. The test facility, named Small Scale Enclosure (SSE), has a vent area of 0,42 m(2) which can host different types of vent; plastic sheet and commercial vent were tested. Realistic levels of congestion are obtained placing a number of gas bottles inside the enclosure. Releases are performed from a buffer tank of a known volume filled with hydrogen at a pressure ranging between 15 and 60 bar. Two nozzles of different diameter and three different release directions were tested, being the nozzle placed at a height where in a real application a leak has the highest probability to occur. Three different ignition locations were investigated as well. This paper is aimed to summarize the main features of the experimental campaign as well as to present its results.

AB The first billion years of cosmic history remains largely unobserved. We demonstrate, using a novel machine learning technique, how combining upper limits on the spatial fluctuations in the 21-cm signal with observations of the sky-averaged 21-cm signal from neutral hydrogen can impro v e our understanding of this epoch. By jointly analysing data from the Shaped Antenna measurement of the background RAdio Spectrum (SARAS3, redshift z approximate to 15-25) and limits from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA, z approximate to 8 and 10), we show that such a synergetic analysis provides tighter constraints on the astroph ysics of galaxies 200 million years after the big bang than can be achieved with the individual data sets. Although our constraints are weak, this is the first time data from a sky-averaged 21-cm experiment and power spectrum experiment have been analysed together. In synergy, the two experiments leave only 64 .9(-0.1)(+0.3 )per cent of the explored broad theoretical parameter space to be consistent with the joint data set, in comparison to 92.3(-0.1)(+0.3 )per cent for SARAS3 and 79.0(-0.2)(+0.5)per cent for HERA alone. We use the joint analysis to constrain star formation efficiency, minimum halo mass for star formation, X-ray luminosity of early emitters, and the radio luminosity of early galaxies. The joint analysis disfavours at 68 per cent confidence a combination of galaxies with X-ray emission that is less than or similar to 33 and radio emission that is greater than or similar to 32 times as efficient as present day galaxies. We disfa v our at 95 per cent confidence scenarios in which power spectra are >= 126 mK(2) at z = 25 and the sky-averaged signals are <=-277 mK.

AB The connection between Zr-2.5%Nb pressure tubes and modified martensitic stainless steel -403 end fittings in Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) at the rolled joint is a critical site marked by enhanced hydrogen diffusion and elevated tensile residual stresses. The application of circumferential stress above a threshold leads to the formation of radial hydrides. Formation of radial hydride leads to a drastic reduction in fracture toughness and increase in Delayed Hydride Cracking (DHC) velocity. A comprehensive understanding of residual stress, hydride orientation and radial hydride fraction in this region is essential for the assessment of pressure tube structural integrity. In this study, we employ 3D nonlinear finite element analysis to estimate the residual stresses near rolled joints for both 220 MWe and 700 MWe pressure tubes. Additionally, we pioneer an experimental investigation into hydride orientation near roll joints through internal pressurization of hydrided pressure tube and end fitting assemblies. The study delves into the influence of residual stresses due to rolling process on hydride orientation and radial hydride fraction, providing crucial insights for the evaluation of the structural integrity of pressure tubes.

AB Aluminum samples have been exposed to a hydrogen plasma generated by a low-pressure - high-density microwave reactor. Aluminum has been chosen as a surrogate for Beryllium. The fluence was kept below 4 x 10(24) ions/m(2), in order to study the first steps of nucleation and growth of surface and bulk defects, i.e. blisters and bubbles. Experimental analyzes and macroscopic rate equation (MRE) modeling on poly- and single-crystals were made to investigate the role played by grains boundaries in the hydrogen retention. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) on Al poly-crystals revealed the production of aluminum hydrides (alanes) as majority species in the desorption flux. Comparison of microscopy observations for three different single-crystal orientations (< 100 >, < 110 > and < 111 >) allowed to determine preferential orientations able to attenuate the formation of blisters.

AB A sudden change in the geometrical parameters of a material, such as bends, T-branches, and welded joints may increase the stress concentration, which in turn may enhance the diffusible hydrogen concentration. In this study, quantitative evaluations of the effect of stress concentration factors on hydrogen environmental embrittlement (HEE) will be studied based on the mechanical performance of notched tensile specimens with variations in the stress concentration factors (K-t) of the X70 pipeline base and weld metal. To highlight the role of stress concentration, the tests are performed under a 10 MPa gas mixture condition with a low partial hydrogen pressure. The maximum strengths of the notched specimens were nearly consistent across all Kt values. The degree of HEE susceptibility of the base metal increased with increasing Kt value. However, in the weld metal, prominent reductions in the RA occurred at all Kt values. The complex HEE susceptibility of the weld metal can be attributed to the synergistic action of the microstructure heterogeneity and K-t values.

AB For the multi-layer and multi-pass welding process of the heavy plate, the hydrogen diffusion behavior was numerically simulated to study the effect of solid-state phase transition (SSPT) on the hydrogen diffusion in the thickness direction, and the influence of the residual stress-induced diffusion after SSPT. The calculation results were compared with the experimental results. The comparison shows that the distribution of hydrogen concentration in the direction of thickness was in good agreement. The position with the most severe cold cracking sensitivity was located at a 20-30 mm depth from the top surface in this article. After welding, the hydrogen concentration in this position was kept at a high level for a long time under the effect of the size-constraint effect of the heavy plate and the existence of welding residual stress gradient. In addition, the SSPT reduced the residual stress level of weld metal (WM) significantly, increased that of the heat affected zone (HAZ), and the hydrogen was redistributed under the influence of stress. In the process of phase transformation, the parameters of hydrogen diffusion property of the material changed dramatically in a short time, the hydrogen diffusion coefficient increased in order of magnitude, and the solubility decreased in order of magnitude. This directly led to the upward diffusion of hydrogen in WM, and produced a self-gathering effect. For a welded joint of heavy plate, the self-gathering effect between passes was effective in the short-range and ineffective in the long-range.

AB Neutron protein crystallography is a powerful tool for investigating protein chemistry because it directly locates hydrogen atom positions in a protein structure. The visibility of hydrogen and deuterium atoms arises from the strong interaction of neutrons with the nuclei of these isotopes. Positions can be unambiguously assigned from diffraction at resolutions typical of protein crystals. Neutrons have the additional benefit to structural biology of not inducing radiation damage in protein crystals. The same crystal could be measured multiple times for parametric studies. Here, we review the basic principles of neutron protein crystallography. The information that can be gained from a neutron structure is presented in balance with practical considerations. Methods to produce isotopically-substituted proteins and to grow large crystals are provided in the context of neutron structures reported in the literature. Available instruments for data collection and software for data processing and structure refinement are described along with technique-specific strategies including joint X-ray/neutron structure refinement. Examples are given to illustrate, ultimately, the unique scientific value of neutron protein crystal structures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Concrete is widely utilized across various industries as a containment material. One essential property related to its performance is permeability, which determines its ability to allow the passage of gases or liquids through its pores and capillaries and even the transmission of aggressive agents. This study focused on investigating the permeability of gases with varying atomic weights and molecular volumes, such as helium, nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, to pass through concrete. The primary objective was to determine the significance of variation in permeability and to evaluate and differentiate their behavior. To achieve this, concrete test specimens were employed, and factors such as cold joint impact, gas pressure, and specimen saturation levels were considered. Throughout the study, changes in weight, specimen humidity, resistivity, and ultrasonic pulse velocity were monitored. The findings suggested that within concrete, the variation in permeability for these gases is negligible. By utilizing the acquired data, the present study estimated the permeability of hydrogen through mathematical models based on gas pressure and concrete thickness. These insights contribute to a deeper comprehension of concrete gas permeability and its potential impact on improving hydrogen containment.

AB The authors investigated the possibility of generation of hydrogen peroxide in seawater of various salinity under mechanochemical effects. Electrochemical methods determined inhomogeneities of the seawater structure. Proposed is possible mechanism of generation of H2O2 at multiple interfaces both in the complex electrolyte and in the presence of the suspension of minerals. At joint mechanochemical effect and UV radiation the prevailing contribution of the former is shown. The possibility of H2O2 generation in the seawater-air-mineral system at concentrations up to 5 x 10(-5) M contributes to produce technologies of mechanochemical purification of the seawater in coastal regions.

AB A novel approach is used for templateless synthesis of polypyrrole - gold nanocomposite material, taking advantage of polypyrrole nanoparticles synthesis method resulting in nanostructures of unblocked surface. Our approach leads to unsupported, nanocomposite system, where presence of gold nanostructures enables hydrogen ions reduction. Electrochemical methods: cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry or rotating disc electrode voltammetry allow to monitor the high rate of hydrogen ions transfer through the conductive polymer and their electrochemical reduction rate. These measurements confirm high active surface area of gold nanostructures immobilized in polypyrrole. On the other hand, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals pseudocapacitive properties of the material, typical for polypyrrole nanostructures. Thus, the obtained nanocomposite material shows joint and unhindered properties typical for gold nanoparticles and polypyrrole nanospheres. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The increasing greenhouse gas emission strongly requires new efficient methods to close the carbon cycle. One promising strategy is to achieve reduction of CO2 and utilization of glycerol simultaneously in one-pot hydrothermal reaction. A possible mechanism through hydrogen-transfer reduction from glycerol was proposed by previous researchers. However, the detailed mechanism is still not clear, which prohibits the development of catalyst. In this study, by adopting a joint experimental and theoretical method, a kinetic model comprising reduction of CO2 and glycerol conversion is elucidated. The activation energy values are obtained in experimental and theory, respectively. The reduced species was found to be CO2 not bicarbonate based on the theoretical calculation.

TI Hydrogen Electrolysis in Refineries
SO OIL GAS-EUROPEAN MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Shell and ITM Power will build the world's largest hydrogen electrolysis plant at the Shell Rheinland Refinery in the Cologne area, Germany. With a peak capacity of 10 MW, the hydrogen will be used for the processing and upgrading of products at the refinery's Wesseling site as well as testing the technology and exploring applications in other sectors. The European partner consortium of Shell, ITM Power, SINTEF, thinkstep and Element Energy is supported by the European Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU). The project, named "REFHYNE", started in January 2018 and is scheduled to be in operation by 2020 after two years of design, permitting, construction and commissioning. It will be the first industrial scale test of the polymer electrolyte membrane technology process.
   This new unit at the Rheinland Refinery enables hydrogen to be made from electricity rather than from natural gas. A unit of this kind brings flexibility that can help stabilise the refinery power grid, thereby facilitating the use of renewable electricity. In addition, if powered by renewable electricity, the green hydrogen will help reduce the carbon intensity of the site and of the transport fuels produced in the refinery. Currently the Rheinland Refinery, Germany's largest refinery, processes approximately 180,000 t of hydrogen annually. The hydrogen is produced by steam reforming from natural gas. The 10 MW electrolyser will enable the production of an additional 1300 t of hydrogen per year, which can be fully integrated into the refinery processes, such as for the desulphurization of conventional fuels.
   Hydrogen has the potential to play an important role in the energy transition. Today, hydrogen is already being used in transport by fuel cell vehicles, as well as in industrial applications. When used in transport, hydrogen can also help improve local air quality, as the only emission of fuel cell vehicles is water vapor.

AB The authors have reported results of MgB2 test coils that exhibited anomalously low n-value. It was discovered that the major cause of the n-value related voltage was nonuniformity of the wire along its length. Based on this finding, the development of a compact 3 T magnet has been started. The magnet consists of six coils of 30 cm bore each. The fields will be 3 T at 4 K and 1.5 T at 20 K, respectively. The coils will be cooled by thermal conduction. One of the center coils was manufactured with the refined wire of improved lengthwise uniformity. Results of tests on this coil showed no measurable n-value related voltage. Superconducting joint development has been ongoing. Current peak multifilament joints show superconductivity up to 120 A at 14 K. Further trials to achieve the full short sample operating current at each temperature are ongoing. The cryogenic design for the magnet is based on the use of dual coolants either with hydrogen or helium and consists of two distinct and separate primary and secondary cooling circuits.

AB While it is widely recognized that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) promotes plant stress tolerance, the precise processes through which H2S modulates this process remains unclear. The processes by which H2S promotes phosphorus deficiency (PD) and salinity stress (SS) tolerance, simulated individually or together, were examined in this study. The adverse impacts on plant biomass, total chlorophyll and chlorophyll fluorescence were more pronounced with joint occurrence of PD and SS than with individual application. Malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and electrolyte leakage (EL) levels in plant leaves were higher in plants exposed to joint stresses than in plants grown under an individual stress. When plants were exposed to a single stress as opposed to both stressors, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) treatment more efficiently decreased EL, MDA, and H2O2 concentrations. Superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, glutathione reductase and ascorbate peroxidase activities were increased by SS alone or in conjunction with PD, whereas catalase activity decreased significantly. The favorable impact of NaHS on all the evaluated attributes was reversed by supplementation with 0.2 mM hypotaurine (HT), a H2S scavenger. Overall, the unfavorable effects caused to NaHS-supplied plants by a single stress were less severe compared with those caused by the combined administration of both stressors.

AB To provide new insight into the dark fermentation process, a multi-lateral study was performed to study the microbiology of 20 different lab-scale bioreactors operated in four different countries (Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Uruguay). Samples (29) were collected from bioreactors with different configurations, operation conditions, and performances. The microbial communities were analyzed using 16S rRNA genes 454 pyrosequencing. The results showed notably uneven communities with a high predominance of a particular genus. The phylum Firmicutes predominated in most of the samples, but the phyla Thermotogae or Proteobacteria dominated in a few samples. Genera from three physiological groups were detected: high-yield hydrogen producers (Clostridium, Kosmotoga, Enterobacter), fermenters with low-hydrogen yield (mostly from Veillonelaceae), and competitors (Lactobacillus). Inocula, reactor configurations, and substrates influence the microbial communities. This is the first joint effort that evaluates hydrogen-producing reactors and operational conditions from different countries and contributes to understand the dark fermentation process.

AB Three different macromolecular diols were synthesized by the reaction of Poly(1,4-butanediol adipate) diol (PBA) and diisocyanate (Isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), Hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and Methylene-bis(4-cyclohexylisocyanate)(HMDI)) at the ratio of 2:1. Based on these macromolecular diols, waterborne polyurethane (WPU) adhesives were prepared. The structure and molecular weights of the WPU were characterized by Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) respectively. Furthermore, the hydrogen bonding interaction of WPU were analyzed by the deconvolution FTIR spectra. The results showed that the hydrogen bonded NH was increased when carbamate was in the soft segment. The crystallinity of WPU was tested by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results showed that the crystallinity of WPU2 (HDI) and WPU3 (HMDI) were enhanced, especially for WPU2. Meanwhile, the Tg,s as well as the mechanical strength, storage modulus, the contact angle and thermo-stability were increased with the introduced carbamate into soft segment. The T-peel tests of plasticized PVC/WPU/plasticized PVC joints and lap-shear tests of wood/WPU adhesive/wood joints were carried out. The results indicated that the carbamate in the soft segment could significantly enhance the adhesion of WPU at an appropriate activation temperature.

AB Herein, a novel W doped Co3S4 composite photocatalyst was successfully prepared by MOF (metal organic framework), Co-ZIF-9, as a nanoscaled template via a hydrothermal treatment. Efficient heteroatom doping emerged a large number of joints in Co3S4-WSX, providing multitudinous active sites for hydrogen catalysis. Moreover, due to these unmatched structural and compositional features, the optimized Co3S4-WSX hybrid without introducing any noble metal cocatalysts in the catalytic system also displayed a brilliant performance for hydrogen evolution and prominent stability under long-term visible light irradiation. In particular, the sample of Co3S4-WSX(0.6)), the amount of hydrogen evolution in the five-hour continuous light could reach up to 428.3 mol, which was increased by 38 times compared with Co-ZIF-9. In addition, some necessary characterization such as XRD, FTIR, SEM, TEM, XPS, BET, UV-vis diffuse spectroscopy, photoelectrochemistry and PL etc. were further examed to support related results and put forward the possible reaction mechanism.

AB Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a very common condition and leads to joint pain, disability, and price tag all over the world. Pathogenesis of OA is closely related to numerous inflammatory and apoptosis cytokines. Hydrogen (H-2) reportedly exhibits a diversity of effects such as anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidative properties via the JNK pathway. However, it is unknown whether H-2 has a protective effect against OA via the JNK signaling pathway. Therefore, the aim of this study was to figure out whether hydrogen has protective effect on chondrocyte and further explore the possible underlying mechanism.
   Methods: The chondrocytes were obtained from the human cartilage tissues. Cells were stimulated by TBHP and treated with hydrogen. In vitro treatment effects were evaluated by Western blot assay, real-time PCR, immunofluorescence and TUNEL method. We conducted mice model of destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) and treated with hydrogen. In vivo treatment effects were evaluated by X-ray imaging assay, safranin O (SO) staining, TUNEL staining and immunohistochemical assay.
   Results: Our results showed that hydrogen can inhibit inflammatory factors (ADAMTS5 and MMP13) and apoptosis factors (cleaved caspase-3, cytochrome c, and Bax) in TBHP-induced chondrocytes. Furthermore, hydrogen can suppress the activation of JNK signaling pathway, whereas the effect of hydrogen can be abolished by anisomycin (a JNK activator). In vivo results showed that hydrogen can down-regulate the expression of p-JNK and cleaved caspase-3 expression.
   Conclusion: We uncovered that hydrogen (H-2) could alleviate apoptosis response and ECM degradation in human chondrocytes via inhibiting the activation of the JNK signaling pathway. Meanwhile, in the surgically-induced DMM mice model, treatment with hydrogen (H-2) performed a significant role in OA progression.

AB Optimizing oxygen levels in a sintering atmosphere seems to be a more economical method to realize die-attachment on a bare copper substrate with silver paste. In this article, the effects of oxygen content on the mechanical and thermal performance of sintered Ag joint on the bare copper substrate were investigated. The 5 x 10(3) ppm was demonstrated as the most appropriate oxygen content for the optimum bare copper joint, which removed most organics in the paste layer while preventing the copper substrate from oxidation. Besides, the bonding mechanism of joints sintered under different oxygen levels was clarified. For joint sintered at 1 x 10(3) ppm, excess residual organics significantly facilitated the formation of hydrogen bonds, resulting in the adhesive-dominated failure mode and worst overall performance. The increase of oxygen content to 5 x 10(3) ppm reinforced the bonding strength due to the Ag-Cu metallic bond formation at the interface and ameliorative densification of the sintered-Ag layer. As the amount of oxygen further increased, the copper substrate was oxidized, and bonding strength experienced a changing course of decline, rise, and flat, which can be attributed to Ag adhesion on the copper surface and the formation of voids at the interface between the oxide layer and copper substrate.

AB The power cycle reliability of Cu nanoparticle joints between Al2O3 heater chips and different heat sinks (Cu 40 wt.%Mo, Al-45 wt.%SiC and pure Cu) was studied to explore the effect of varying the mismatch in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between the heater chip and the heat sink from 4.9 to 10.3 ppm/K. These joints were prepared under a hydrogen atmosphere by thermal treatment at 250, 300 and 350 degrees C using a pressure of 1 MPa, and all remained intact after 3000 cycles of 65/200 degrees C and 65/250 degrees C when the CTE mismatch was less than 7.3 ppm/K, despite vertical cracks forming in the sintered Cu. When the CTE mismatch was 103 ppm/K, the Cu nanoparticle joint created at 300 degrees C endured the power cycle tests, but the joint created at 250 degrees C broke by lateral cracks in the sintered Cu after 1000 cycles of 65/200 degrees C. The Cu nanoparticle joint created at 350 degrees C also broke by vertical cracks in the heater chip after 1000 cycles of 65/250 degrees C, suggesting that although sintered Cu can be strengthened to tolerate the stress by increasing the joint temperature, this eventually causes the weak and brittle chip to fracture through accumulated stress. The calculation results of stresses on the heater chip showed that the stress can be higher than the strength of Al2O3 when the CTE mismatch is 103 ppm/K and the Young's modulus of the sintered Cu is higher than 20 GPa, suggesting that the heater chip can be broken.

ID IMPROVEMENT
AB Cryogenic containment systems for LH2 (Liquid Hydrogen) and LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) generally require two barriers: the primary barrier made of stainless steel or Invar which contacts directly the cryogenic liquids, the secondary barrier made of composite or metal foil which functions as the faces of sandwich constructions for thermal insulation.
   The faces of sandwich constructions are bridged with metal strips which are usually adhesively bonded for gas tightness. When cryogenic liquids are loaded in the containment system, the adhesive bridge joints are subjected to both the thermal load and deformation due to the shrinkage of the sandwich constructions.
   Since the maximum deformation in the sandwich construction systems may occur in the metal bridge between the two sandwich constructions, the cryogenic performances of adhesive bridge joint with level difference, which would be generated due to manufacturing tolerance, were evaluated using both the new appropriate test method and FE analysis.

AB The crystal structure of the nickel battery positive electrode material, beta-NiOOH, is analyzed through a joint approach involving NMR and FTIR spectroscopies, powder neutron diffraction and DFT calculations. The obtained results confirm that structural changes occur during the beta-Ni(OH)(2)/beta-NiOOH transformation leading to a metastable crystal structure with a TP2 host lattice. This structure involves two types of hydrogen atoms both forming primary and secondary hydrogen bonds. The formation of TP2 NiOOH as opposed to the more stable P3 host type during beta-Ni(OH)(2)/beta-NiOOH transformation has a kinetic origin that can be understood by a lower strain penalty involved in the transformation.

AB Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and substance P play a key role in inflammation. Using animal models of inflammation of different etiologies such as acute pancreatitis, sepsis, burns, and joint inflammation, studies have recently shown an important role of the proinflammatory action of H2S and substance P. Also, H2S contributes to inflammation in different conditions via substance P. This chapter reviews methods and key data that have led to our current understanding of the role of H2S and substance P in inflammation.

AB Underwater wet welding is widely used in offshore platform maintenance, oil pipeline repair and wreck salvage operations. A high diffusible hydrogen content is recognized as one of the critical reasons behind the reduction in the reliability of underwater wet welded joints. In this study, the entry route of hydrogen during underwater wet flux-cored arc welding of 304 stainless steel at a depth of 0.5 m was first con-firmed experimentally using an in-situ X-ray imaging system. The hydrogen charging was deemed to dominantly occur when pendant droplets were formed due to the extremely high temperature of molten metal and the absence of slag coverage. This resulted in 13.51 mL/100 g of diffusible hydrogen remaining in the droplet and 9.42 mL/100 g in the deposited metal. To prevent hydrogen charging, an unprece-dented molten-slag-covering droplet transfer mode was developed by reducing the CaF2 content and maintaining the CaF2/TiO2 to an appropriate ratio in the flux, through which the molten slag sponta-neously covered the droplet, electric arc and molten pool completely during the entire welding process and the entry of hydrogen was successfully blocked and the diffusible hydrogen content was reduced to the same level as that achieved via onshore welding (3.26 mL/100 g).(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Ag-(0-8 mol%) CuO is used to successfully join aluminized ferritic stainless steel interconnect to the ceria-gadolinia (CGO) barrier layer of a solid oxide fuel/electrolysis cell by reactive air brazing at 1000 degrees C in air. The wetting of Ag-CuO on CGO is tailored by varying the CuO content. The effects of the CuO content on the joint microstructure are discussed. The long-term stability of brazed joints is evaluated by aging in oxidizing (air) and reducing (4% H-2-50% H2O-N-2) atmospheres at 800 degrees C for 250 h. An Ag-2mol% CuO braze results in the best joint stability during aging. Aluminization of the steel to create an alumina surface layer provides excellent protection of the steel both during the joining process and aging in the 2 atm. No degradation related to steel corrosion and outward diffusion of elements from the steel can be observed. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Featured Application Modern robotic approaches to the evaluation of sensitivity to hydrogen embrittlement and the degradation of steel and alloys by wear products.Abstract This paper briefly describes the conceptual direction of the application of computer vision (CV) methods that involve controlling the morphology of hydrogenated wear particles (WPs). During long-term operation, in the surface and subsurface layers of the materials of parts in the tribo-joint, changes in the micromechanisms of fracture occur, which change the morphology of WPs. It has been shown that the developed computer program (CP) can be used to monitor the fractography of the surface of wear particles, and, accordingly, it is possible to control changes in the surface morphology. Therefore, it is possible to predict the operational stability and durability of the tribo-joint. A conceptual scheme for determining the performance of a tribotechnical assembly depending on the determined parameters of WPs is presented. The modes marked on it, including normal operation, transient, run-in, and catastrophic failure, can be evaluated by robotics approaches.

AB Hyaluronic acid and phospholipids are two components in the synovial joint cavity that contribute to joint lubrication synergistically. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed and hydrogen bonds in hyaluronic acid were analyzed to identify specific sites that are responsible for its physical cross-linking. Two molecular masses of hyaluronic acid, 10 kDa and 160 kDa, were considered. We use molecular dynamics simulations and the small world network approach to investigate dynamic couplings using a distance map applied to oxygen atoms in a chain of hyaluronic acid in the presence of phospholipids and water. The distance characterizing the coupling can be defined in various ways to bring out the most evident differences between various scenarios of the polymer chain conformation We show herein a physical distance understood as H-bond length and classes of these distances which are defined in a coarse-grained picture of the molecule. Simulation results indicate that addition of phospholipids has little influence on hyaluronic acid crosslinking. However, longer chains and addition of lipids promote appreciably long lasting (resilient) networks that may be of importance in biological systems. Specific sites for hydrogen bonding of phospholipids to hyaluronic acid have also been identified.

   API 5L X60 grade
AB In the present work, the failure investigation of a 30 in. diameter gas transmission pipeline (API 5L X-60 grade steel) has been described. The failure was due to a longitudinal crack developing in the centerline of longitudinal weld joint. Mechanisms and morphology of crack initiation and propagation were studied through different tests including: thickness measurement, chemical composition analysis, metallographic inspection, mechanical property testing, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The experiments resulted to the conclusion that some factors associated with Sulphide Stress Cracking (SSC) and metallurgical defects cause the failure of weld joint pipe. Detailed examination revealed that these factors are inappropriate welding parameters, pitting corrosion on longitudinal weld, and hydrogen permeation to the weld metal.

ID H2S
AB Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a physiological gaseous transmitter that plays a crucial role in maintaining the cellular redox state. Arthritis is usually accompanied by redness, swelling, pain, dysfunction and deformity of the joints, and in severe cases can lead to joint disability. Disorders of H2S level are associated with the pathological process of arthritis. In this paper, a near-infrared fluorescent probe (TX-H2S) was developed to detect the alterations in H2S levels of arthritis. TX-H2S has excellent response performance to H2S such as near-infrared emission (725 nm), large Stokes shift (125 nm) and high fluorescence enhancement (72-fold). Owing to low cytotoxicity, the probe can be employed to observe the alterations of exogenous and endogenous H2S level in HeLa and HepG2 cells. By making full use of near-infrared emission and good biocompatibility, the probe can be employed for exogenous H2S imaging in mice, and is able to track the fluctuation of H2S level during arthritis and its treatment. These make the probe have the potential to invent an efficient tool for the diagnosis of arthritic disease and its treatment.

AB As one of the main receptors of a second messenger, cGMP, cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) isoforms I and II regulate distinct physiological processes. The design of isoform-specific activators is thus of great biomedical importance and requires detailed structural information about PKG isoforms bound with activators, including accurate positions of hydrogen atoms and a description of the hydrogen bonding and water architecture. Here, we determined a 2.2 angstrom room-temperature joint X-ray/neutron (XN) structure of the human PKG II carboxyl cyclic nucleotide binding (CNB-B) domain bound with a potent PKG II activator, 8-pCPT-cGMP. The XN structure directly visualizes intermolecular interactions and reveals changes in hydrogen bonding patterns upon comparison to the X-ray structure determined at cryo-temperatures. Comparative analysis of the backbone hydrogen/deuterium exchange patterns in PKG II:8-pCPT-cGMP and previously reported PKG I beta:cGMP XN structures suggests that the ability of these agonists to activate PKG is related to how effectively they quench dynamics of the cyclic nucleotide binding pocket and the surrounding regions.

AB In this study, Ultra-high Hard Armor (UHA) steel is welded with Rolled Homogenous Armor (RHA) steels using Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) process with Austenitic Stainless Steel (ASS), Duplex Stainless Steel (DSS), and Low Hydrogen Ferritic (LHF) fillers. Ballistic resistance against Weld Metal (WM) is determined using 7.62 x 39 mm BALL projectile. Three new modes of failure were identified from the ballistic testing (i) Finer Wear Debris with Cleavage (FWDC) (ii) Coarser Wear Debris with Cleavage (CWDC) (iii) Cleavage failure (C), based on the fractured surface. All joints stopped the ball projectile at the weld metal region without perforation. However, the joint fabricated using ASS electrodes shows superior ballistic performance than other joints with Cleavage mode of failure (C) mainly due to the absence of wear debris. ASS weldment (5% Delta ferrite and 95% austenite) performs better in ballistic resistance because of the plastic deformation along with energy absorption properties of the austenite phase than DSS (69 Delta ferrite and 31% austenite) and LHF (100% ferrite). Migration of Chromium (Cr) from the weld metal to base metal results in an unmixed zone and martensitic band in the HAZ of ASS joint.(c) 2022 CIRP.

AB As part of the analysis of the possibility of using the Ukrainian gas transportation system for transporting blends of natural gas and hydrogen, the peculiarities of the influence of hydrogen degradation of pipe steel on the brittle strength of girth welds and local corrosion metal losses were considered. For this, they were used the methods of finite-element modeling of the stress-strain state of structures during welding and subsequent operation loading along with advanced criteria of macroscopic fracture of a body with a crack. The results of predicting the safety factor for a typical welded part of a main gas pipeline with postulated surface cracks during the transportation of gas-hydrogen blends of various compositions showed that the most susceptible to brittle fracture are the weld metal and heat-affected zone. But with regard to the fatigue strength of welded joints under the action of cyclic loading by internal pressure or bending moment, larger stress intensity factor ranges in the heat-affected zone cause a more significant reduction of the residual safety factors. Local corrosion damage during the transportation of gas-hydrogen blends had a considerable negative impact on pipeline reliability, particularly when material properties experienced hydrogen degradation and a decrease in fracture toughness. However, this effect could be mitigated by adjusting the operating load accordingly.

AB The paper considers the integration and joint operation of a methane steam reforming unit (MSRU) and a heat pump unit (HPU) at a thermal power plant (TPP) as one of the possible ways to follow the global decarbonization policy. Research methods are simulation modeling of a thermal power plant in the program "United Cycle" and analysis of thermodynamic cycles of heat pumps. The Petrozavodskaya combined heat and power plant (CHPP) was selected as the object of the research. During the research, technological schemes for hydrogen production at the Petrozavodskaya CHPP were developed: with steam extraction to MSRU from a live steam collector and with the use of production steam. A scheme for HPU integration is proposed to reduce the cost of hydrogen and to reduce waste heat. A heat pump is used to preheat natural gas before going to MSRU. A method for determining fuel costs for hydrogen production in the trigeneration cycle of a thermal power plant was developed. The minimum specific fuel consumption for hydrogen production-7.854 t ref.f./t H-2-is achieved in the mode with steam extraction to MSRU from the turbine PT-60-130/13 (industrial extraction with a flow rate of 30 t/h). At this mode, the coefficient of fuel heat utilization is the highest among all modes with hydrogen production-66.18%.

AB The constantly increasing demand for renewable energy sources leads to the necessity of transporting large amounts of hydrogen. Since pipelines enable a cost-effective way for the distribution of gaseous hydrogen, the interaction of hydrogen and the pipeline materials must be carefully investigated as hydrogen can cause a degradation of the mechanical properties under certain conditions. Especially welds, which are assumed to be more susceptible to the degradation enhanced by hydrogen, are of great interest. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of gaseous hydrogen on the mechanical properties of an X65 pipeline, and the longitudinal submerged arc welding (SAW) welded joint. The tests are conducted using the hollow specimen technique on two types of specimens: one extracted from the base material (BM) and the other extracted as a cross-weld (CW) specimen consisting of BM and weld seam. The specimens are charged in situ under a pressure of 60 bar and tested using slow strain rate (SSR) tensile tests with a nominal strain rate of 10-5 s-1. The properties obtained of specimens tested in hydrogen atmosphere are compared to the properties of comparable specimen in inert argon atmosphere as a reference. The performed tests showed a decrease of the reduction of area (RA) from 72% in inert atmosphere to 52% in hydrogen atmosphere for the CW specimen and a decrease from 73% in inert atmosphere to 51% for the BM. Metallographic analyses showed the crack initiation between fine-grained heat-affected zone (FGHAZ) and BM for the specimens tested in hydrogen atmosphere as well as for the reference specimens. This leads to the conclusion that the location of the crack initiation does not change due to the presence of gaseous hydrogen.

AB An approach based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed to address the fuel cell thermal management system's circulating water pump and radiator control issue. The proposed joint control strategy consists of three main components. First, a deep deterministic policy gradient-based control framework is employed to overcome the strong coupling characteristics between the radiator and circulating water pump and enable joint control. Second, an improved method called TCO-DDPG is introduced to address time delay and inertia problems in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). This method adopts an improved updating delay strategy, optimized noise, and a classification experience playback and smooth target strategy to enhance algorithm robustness. Third, the TCO-DDPG-based PEMFC temperature control strategy replaces the traditional control framework's two independent controllers with an agent that does not depend on the system model and can control both the cooling water flow rate and the radiator fan speed.Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its ability to control the PEMFC thermal management system more precisely and effectively than other algorithms. Specifically, the proposed TCO-DDPG joint control technique reduces the average adjustment time by 7.6%, 16.01%, and 22.74%, and overshoot by 2.25 times, 4.2 times, and 4.5 times compared to the TD3, GA-PID, and PID algorithms, respectively.(c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB A metallic ceramic film consisting of nitrides, carbides and oxides of Ti, Cr and Al was prepared on the surface of a drilling pipe joint by low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). The film was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The adhesive ability and the corrosion resistance performance were evaluated by scratch test and corrosion test, respectively. The results show that the film is dense and homogeneous with 15 mu m in thickness including a 5 pm transition layer. The film presents a good adherence to the substrate with no cracks and no pores. It could decrease electrochemical corrosion and chemical corrosion through separating the harmful atoms or ions from the substrate. Particularly, it could also effectively prevent H2S and CO2 from contacting the steel, avoiding hydrogen blistering (FIB) and hydrogen to induce cracking (HIC). Consequently, the service life of drilling pipe can be greatly improved.

AB The goal of the EU Horizon 2020 RISE project 778307 "Hydrogen fuelled utility vehicles and their support systems utilising metal hydrides" (HYDRIDE4MOBILITY), is in addressing critical issues towards a commercial implementation of hydrogen powered forklifts using metal hydride (MH) based hydrogen storage and PEM fuel cells, together with the systems for their refuelling at industrial customers facilities. For these applications, high specific weight of the metallic hydrides has an added value, as it allows counterbalancing of a vehicle with no extra cost. Improving the rates of H-2 charge/discharge in MH on the materials and system level, simplification of the design and reducing the system cost, together with improvement of the efficiency of system "MH store-FC", is in the focus of this work as a joint effort of consortium uniting academic teams and industrial partners from two EU and associated countries Member States (Norway, Germany, Croatia), and two partner countries (South Africa and Indonesia).
   The work within the project is focused on the validation of various efficient and cost-competitive solutions including (i) advanced MH materials for hydrogen storage and compression, (ii) advanced MH containers characterised by improved charge-discharge dynamic performance and ability to be mass produced, (iii) integrated hydrogen storage and compression/refuelling systems which are developed and tested together with PEM fuel cells during the collaborative efforts of the consortium.
   This article gives an overview of HYDRIDE4MOBILITY project focused on the results generated during its first phase (2017-2019). (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB This paper studies the corrosion fatigue crack growth (CFCG) in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution of the local zones of A7N01S-T5 aluminum alloy metal inert gas (MIG) welded joints cut from high-speed train underframes after service lives of 1.8 million km. The results show that the base metal (BM) region exhibits the highest rate of CFCG compared to both the heat-affected zone (HAZ) and the weld metal (WM) zone. Crack features suggest that the corrosion fatigue failure mode of the BM is hydrogen-assisted propagation and that the failure mode for both the HAZ and WM is anodic dissolution. We calculate that the multi-site adsorption and substitution of Cl- on the surface of the passivation film can make the oxygen and aluminum atoms detach from the surface of the passivation film, causing its destruction and allowing the cracks to expand further. Hydrogen is more likely to accumulate and diffuse along the grain boundaries, reducing their strength and causing them to become the most likely orientation for crack propagation. This study provides the new insight into the specific CFCG mechanisms of each zone in aluminum alloy welded joints.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Blending green hydrogen from renewable generations into the natural gas infrastructure can effectively mitigate carbon emissions of energy consumers. However, distributed hydrogen blending could lead to heterogeneous gas compositions across the network. The traditional nodal energy price scheme is designed for uniform gas composition, which cannot reflect the impacts of heterogeneous nodal gas composition and carbon emission mitigation. This paper proposes a novel nodal energy price scheme in hydrogen-blended integrated electricity and gas systems (H-IEGS). First, we propose a joint market-clearing model for H-IEGS, where the nonlinear physical properties of gas mixtures caused by heterogeneous gas compositions are characterized. The impacts of hydrogen blending on the carbon emission cost are also quantified. To retrieve the nodal energy price from this highly nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problem, a successive second-order cone programming (SSOCP) method is tailored to get the dual variables tractably. Considering the continuous market clearing process, a warm-start technique is proposed to provide initial reference points for the SSOCP to improve computation efficiency. Finally, an H-IEGS test case in Belgium and a large-scale practical case in Northwest China are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In the present study, a neutral slag system was designed and verified for its protection in underwater wet flux-cored arc welding. This neutral slag system forms a stable protective layer of molten salt on the surface of the molten pool, mechanically isolating the molten metal from the water environment and effectively delaying heat loss. More crucially, it also retained the chemical metallurgical dehydrogenation component. When pure Ni belt was used as the outer metal, weld joints free of porosity were obtained, and the diffusible hydrogen content of the deposited metal was 3.61 mL/100 g, close to the level of onshore welding. This neutral slag system was further extended to the use of a pure Fe belt, where the diffused hydrogen content of the molten metal was 10.40 mL/100 g.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB The goal of this paper was determining the physical and chemical properties of some medicinal plants which are used against the Covid19 symptoms. In this work, seven medicinal species for the most frequently symptoms of Covid19 disease such as fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, anorexia, muscle-joint pain, headache and Nausea-vomiting based on the fidelity level index has been accomplished.
   Positive stranded RNA viruses, coronaviruses (CoVs), can infect humans and multiple species of animals through enteric, respiratory, and central nervous system diseases with attractive targets for designing anti- Covid19 conjunction. In this work, it has been investigated the compounds of kaempferol, quercetin, demethoxycurcumine, naringenin, apigenine-7-glucoside, oleuropein and catechin as a probable anti pandemic Covid19 receptor derived from medicinal plants.
   Anti-Covid19 through the hydrogen bonding using the physicochemical properties including heat of formation, Gibbs free energy, electronic energy, charge distribution of active parts in the hydrogen bonding, NMR estimation of medicinal ingredients jointed to the database amino acids fragment of Tyr-Met-His as the selective zone of the Covid19, positive frequency and intensity of different normal modes of these structures have been evaluated. The theoretical calculations were done at various levels of theory to gain the more accurate equilibrium geometrical results, and IR spectral data for each of the complex proposed drugs of N-terminal or O-terminal auto-cleavage substrate were individually determined to elucidate the structural flexibility and substrate binding of seven medicinal plants jointed to active site of Covid19 molecule. A comparison of these structures with two configurations provides new insights for the design of substrate-based anti-targeting Covid19. This indicates a feasible model for designing wide-spectrum of anti- Covid19 drugs. The structure-based optimization of these structures has yielded two more efficacious lead compounds, N and O atoms through forming the hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) with potent anti- Covid19.
   Finally, two medicinal ingredients of apigenine-7-glucoside and demethoxycurcumine jointed to TMH have directed to a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. The results strongly suggest that the different data observed in the apigenine-7-glucoside and demethoxycurcumine in the solvent is principally due to basis set functions, induced by a change in polarity of the environment. It is clear that an increase in the dielectric constants enhances the stability of these anti-Covid19 drugs.

AB With increasing performance demands and the growing dimensions of structures, the challenges for fastening technology in steel construction are also rising. To ensure a secure and long-lasting connection of individual components, high-strength bolted joints of property class 10.9 are essential. They play a key role in structural integrity and operational safety. The reliable performance of these connections is crucial to preventing accidents, unplanned downtimes, and high repair costs. At the same time, the use of high-strength fasteners of property class 10.9 increases the risk of hydrogen-induced stress corrosion cracking (H-SCC). The combination of a susceptible material condition, mechanical stress, and hydrogen availability can, under certain conditions, lead to delayed fractures without warning. This article presents four case studies of failures in high-strength bolted connections and analyzes key factors influencing their susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement. It becomes evident that damage can occur even when applicable standards are met. This is due to various factors, including unfavorable material conditions, manufacturing influences, corrosion protection application, and assembly processes. The study highlights that many of these failures could be prevented through targeted material selection, optimized manufacturing processes, and stringent process control.

AB In this work, three ultrasonic radiators in different shapes have been designed in order to investigate the effects of radiator shapes on the argon bubble dispersion and diving as well as the degassing efficiency on magnesium melt. The radiator shape has a strong influence on the bubble diving and dispersion by ultrasound. A massive argon bubble slowly flows out from the radiator with the hemispherical cap, due to the covering hemispherical cap. Using a concave radiator can intensively crush the argon bubbles and drive them much deep into the water/melt, depending on the competition between the argon flow and opposite joint shear force from the concave surface. The evolution of wall bubbles involves the ultrasonic cavities carrying dissolved gas, migrating to the vessel wall, and escaping from the liquid. Hydrogen removal can be efficiently achieved using a concave radiator. The hydrogen content can be reduced from 22.3 mu/g down to 8.7 mu g/g. Mechanical properties are significantly promoted, due to the structure refinement and efficient hydrogen removal.

AB This paper summarises the results from a blind-prediction benchmark study for models used for estimating the consequences of vented hydrogen deflagrations, as well as for users of such models. The work was part of the HySEA project that received funding from the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU) under grant agreement no. 671461. The first blind-prediction benchmark exercise in the HySEA project focused on vented explosions with homogeneous hydrogen-air mixtures in 20-foot ISO containers. The scenarios selected for the second blind-prediction study focused on vented deflagrations in inhomogeneous hydrogen-air mixtures resulting from continuous stratification of hydrogen during vertical jet releases inside 20-foot ISO containers. The deflagrations were vented through commercial vent panels located on the roof of the containers.
   The test program included two configurations and four experiments, i.e. two repeated tests for each scenario. The paper compares experimental results and model predictions and discusses the implications of the findings for safety related to hydrogen applications. Several modellers predicted the stratification of hydrogen inside the container during the release phase with reasonable accuracy. However, there is significant spread in the model predictions, especially for the maximum reduced explosion pressure, and including predictions from different modellers using the same model system. The results from the blind-prediction benchmark studies performed as part of the HySEA project constitute a strong incentive for developers of consequence models to improve their models, implement automated procedures for scenario definition and grid generation, and update training and guidelines for users of the models.

AB A joint experimental and theoretical investigation of the valence-shell excitations of hydrogen deuteride has been performed by the fast electron impact method at an incident electron energy of 1500 eV and the multireference single- and double-excitation configuration-interaction method. Momentum-transfer-dependent inelastic squared form factors for the vibronic states belonging to the B-1 Sigma(+)(u), C-1 Pi(u), and EF1 Sigma(+)(g) of molecular hydrogen deuteride have been derived with a high-energy resolution of 70 meV. Similar to the results of molecular hydrogen [L. Q. Xu, K. Xu, Y. G. Peng, X. Xu, Y. W. Liu, Y. Wu, K. Yang, N. Hiraoka, K. D. Tsuei, J. G. Wang, and L. F. Zhu, Phys. Rev. A 97, 032503 (2018)1, the present calculations do not satisfactorily reproduce the profiles of the inelastic squared form factors for the higher vibronic states of the B-1 Sigma(+)(u) of hydrogen deuteride. However, the discrepancies between the experimental and calculated results of the B-1 Sigma(+)(u) of hydrogen deuteride show a weaker dependence on the vibronic number than those of molecular hydrogen, i.e., the present experimental results for the B-1 Sigma(+)(u)of hydrogen deuteride are in better agreement with the calculated ones than those of the molecular hydrogen. It is very likely that the electronic-vibrational coupling effect in hydrogen deuteride is less important than that in molecular hydrogen. For the C-1 Pi(u) state and some vibronic excitations of the EF1 Sigma(+)(g) state, the present experimental results are lower than the present calculations, which may be due to the fact that the first Born approximation does not hold at an incident electron energy of 1500 eV.

AB As an ideal antioxidant and anti-apoptotic substance, hydrogen (H-2) has protective effects on many isolated organs, such as the heart, lung and kidney. In this study, we explore whether H-2 improves the preservation effect of osteochondral allograft by adding it to Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) solution during the tissue culture stage. The osteochondral allograft apparatus was used to harvest 60 pieces of cylindrical allografts (l=10mm, d=6mm) cartilage in the lateral loading area of the femoral condyle from the pig knee joint in the aseptic condition, and the grafts were randomly divided into 4 groups: Control group (DMEM solution without hydrogen); H-1 group (DMEM solution with hydrogen concentration of 0.2mmol/L); H-2 group (DMEM solution with hydrogen concentration of 0.4mmol/L); and H-3 group (DMEM solution with hydrogen concentration of 0.8mmol/L). The chondrocyte viability, histological changes (hematoxylin and eosin staining, Safranine O staining, and collagen type II immunohistochemistry staining) and biomechanical properties (Young's modulus) of the osteochondral allograft were investigated after 28days' storage. The chondrocyte viability and proteoglycan and collagen type II contents in the H-3 and H-2 groups were higher than that in the Control and H-1 groups, and the H-3 group had the highest values. However, significant differences were not observed between the four groups based on Young's modulus. Hydrogen as an additive to the DMEM solution improved the preservation effect of osteochondral allograft. The preservation effect of hydrogen occurred in a concentration-dependent manner.

AB This paper investigates the hydrogen diffusion process in X80 steel under the coupling condition of a symmetric tensile and compressive stress fields. The stress gradient introduced through a four-point-bending inflict a stress-induction effect on hydrogen diffusion. When the direction of stress gradient is the same as that of hydrogen's diffusion, it promotes the diffusion of hydrogen atoms. Conversely, it would inhibit the diffusion process of hydrogen atoms. In addition, deformation can also affect the intrinsic hydrogen diffusion coefficient of X80 steel by changing the density of dislocation traps inside the sample. As long as the dislocation density N-T(sigma) in the loaded sample decreases by no more than 5% compared to that N-T(0) in original sample, the experimentally measured value of intrinsic hydrogen diffusion coefficient of X80 steel can be achieved. The decrease in dislocation density was verified through an in-situ EBSD test under various uniaxial tensile stress. The joint function of above two mechanisms resulted in an increase in apparent hydrogen diffusion coefficient as the degree of deformation increases. However, the change is more significant when hydrogen diffuses along the direction of partial derivative sigma(h)/partial derivative x>0. Meanwhile, an increase in strain energy caused by the deformation and the reconstruction of dislocations can affect the anodic dissolution process of X80 steel through mechanochemical effects and local-additional-potential effects, respectively. The two compete with each other, causing the anodic dissolution current of X80 steel to show a trend of first increase and then decrease with raised deformation degree on both the tensile and compressive stress sides, which coincide well with the dislocation reconstruction phenomenon within the current deformation range.

AB Arthroplasty brings the wear problems because of body fluid has poor performance as lubricant. Lubricant which is used in artificial joints will rapidly degrade and be absorbed by human body after injecting. To prolong the lubricant's effectiveness, this study prepared chitosan/poly(ethylene glycol) (CS/PEG) and textures to play a role in joint lubrication and wear protection. Chitosan (CS) and poly(ethylene glycol) which have biocompatibility and biodegradability properties can be used in human body. The tribological results shown that CS/PEG sol has excellent performance when this sol was composed by 2 wt% CS and 30 wt% PEG, the average friction coefficient below 0.016 under the condition of 30-90 N load (pressure 4.2-12.6 MPa). In this study, CS/PEG was added in the texture of artificial joints, then the surfaces of the CS/PEG formed gel via NaOH solidification effect. The CS/PEG gel film could prevent the CS/PEG sol from diluting in body fluid. Meanwhile, FT-IR, XRD, UV/vis and Raman spectra revealed that CS associated with PEG via hydrogen bond effect may form a particular structure, which leaded the good tribological performance. This study provides a new, simple and green approach to enhance tribological performances of artificial joints. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In pursuit of the "double carbon" objectives, converting high-carbon thermal power plants into carbon capture power plants is recognized as an effective measure to mitigate carbon emissions. In order to improve the economy of the system, an electric hydrogen generation unit is introduced, and an economic dispatch strategy that considers the combination of a flexible carbon capture power plant and electric hydrogen generation is proposed. Firstly, the low-carbon principle of the flexible carbon capture plant is introduced, and secondly, the joint operation structure of the flexible carbon capture plant, pumped storage, and hydrogen generation is constructed in order to fully exploit the synergistic operation potential of the hydrogen and carbon capture plants. On this basis, an economic dispatch model with the objective of the lowest combined system cost of the sum of system operation cost, system carbon trading cost, hydrogen production revenue, and wind and light abandonment cost is established, fuzzy parameters are used to characterize the uncertainty levels of wind and light, fuzzy opportunity constraints are established, and the model is solved using an improved sparrow search algorithm. The results of the example show that the proposed model reduces the comprehensive cost by 20.9% and carbon emissions by 61.77% compared with the existing model, which has significant low-carbon economic benefits.

AB The complementary operation of hydropower, photovoltaic, and wind power can promote the integration of renewable energy resources into the grid. However, the competition of power transmission channels among multiple energy raises surpluses significantly. This study equips a hydrogen production plant for the hydro-wind-PV hybrid system to utilize the power surplus. First, a multi-scale nested joint operation model that considers both long-term and short-term operation strategies is proposed to simulate the operation process of the hybrid system. Then, the potential surplus of the system is evaluated and used as the power source of the hydrogen production plant. Lastly, the optimal hydrogen production plant size is determined based on economic and technical analysis. A case study is performed with the Yalong River basin of China. The results show that (McElroy and Chen, 2017 (1)) The deployment of a 260 MW hydrogen production system has the potential to boost the annual power generation benefit of the hybrid system by 610 million CNY; (2) The fluctuation of hydropower station output is effectively reduced, subsequently mitigating operational risks. Especially during flood season, the power variation coefficient experiences a notable decrease of approximately 75%; Liu and Xu (2022) (3) The deployment of hydrogen production plants is more economically feasible than expanding power transmission channels, particularly when considering long-distance power transmission. Furthermore, given that hydrogen production plants frequently operate under fluctuating power conditions, the electrolyzers and compressors must exhibit prompt responsiveness to these power variations.

AB To meet the growing demand for lightweight structures in the aerospace industry, laser welding of dissimilar high-strength aluminum alloys has emerged as a key manufacturing technology. However, the incorporation of filler materials during laser welding significantly influences porosity formation and microstructural evolution, thereby affecting the mechanical properties of the welded joints. Unlike previous studies that have focused on a single filler material, this study systematically investigates, for the first time, the effects of three distinct types of filler materials (atomized powders of AlCu5, AlSi12, and AlMg5) on the macroscopic morphology, microstructure, and mechanical properties of laser-welded joints between dissimilar AA2195 and AA7075 aluminum alloys. The study results demonstrate that, in comparison with the other two filler materials, the grains in the AlSi12-welded joint were significantly refined in both the weld zone (WZ) and the partially melted zone (PMZ), with grain sizes reduced to 31.2 mu m and 15.9 mu m, respectively. The addition of Si reduces the thermal conductivity of the molten pool, thereby slowing the solidification rate and promoting the escape of hydrogen bubbles, resulting in an internal porosity as low as 1.07% in the joint. Moreover, the AlSi12 welded joint exhibited the highest proportion of high-angle grain boundaries in the PMZ, reaching 91.51%. In addition, the interaction between the second phase and dislocations significantly impeded dislocation motion. Owing to the synergistic effects of multiple mechanisms, the resistance to crack initiation and propagation in the AlSi12 welded joint was significantly improved, with the fracture location shifting from the conventional PMZ to the WZ, and the ultimate tensile strength reached 285 MPa.

AB Rigid closed-cell foam is widely used to thermally insulate liquid hydrogen and oxygen tanks of space launch vehicles due to its lightweight, mechanical strength and thermal-insulating performance. Up to now, little information is available on the intrusion of moisture into the foam that subjects one side to liquid hydrogen temperatures and the other side to room temperatures and high relative humidity. A novel cryogenic moisture uptake apparatus has been designed and fabricated to measure the moisture uptake into the polyurethane foam. For safety and convenience, two identical single-stage pulse tube cryocoolers instead of liquid hydrogen are used to cool one side of the foam specimen to the lowest temperature of 26 K. Total of eight specimens in three groups, according to whether there is a butt-joint or weathering period, are tested respectively for both 5 h and 9 h. The additional weight due to moisture uptake of the foam for the 26 K cases is compared to previous measurements at 79 K. The results are instructive for the applications of foam to the insulation of liquid hydrogen tanks in space launch vehicles. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The membranes of vanadium alloys can be substantially more productive and much cheaper than the palladium alloy membranes which are widely used for hydrogen separation. However, the insufficient workability of vanadium alloys makes difficult producing the membranes of any shape, except for small thick flat samples, suitable only for laboratory studies, while membranes in the form of thin-walled tubes are most preferable for practical use. Such seamless thin-walled self-maintained membranes of tubular shape, made of V-Pd and V-Fe alloys with a thin Pd-coating on their inner and outer sides and with welded joints to stainless steel on both ends, were fabricated and tested for their throughput, service life, mechanical stability, and capability of hydrogen recovering from WGS mixtures. In view of reliable and highly productive operation of tubular V-alloy membranes as well as of their absolute selectiveness, the assembly from 18 membranes was fabricated to use it in the multi-fuel processor feeding a 1 kW PEM FC and providing up to 16 slpm of ultrapure hydrogen by the steam conversion of light and heavy hydrocarbons including diesel "Euro 5". A similar assembly made of V-Fe alloy membranes was estimated for hydrogen purification in MOCVD applications. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB With the further deterioration of environment and the depletion of fossil fuels, the alternative energy sources are urgently needed to be discovered. Hydrogen holds great promise thanks to its unlimited resources, high energy density and the environmentally friendly nature. However, its low volume density under normal temperature and pressure becomes the main challenge for on-board storage. Owing to its high potential of safety, one of the optimal solution for the future hydrogen vehicle is storing hydrogen using metal hydride (MH) under proper temperature and pressure. This work focuses on the state of charge (SOC) estimation of the embedded MH hydrogen storage tank. High precise estimating of the remaining energy will contribute to both the evaluation of reliability and the design of control strategy. A statistical model of SOC is proposed based on the database collected form laboratory experiments and real operation vehicle test. What's more, a joint multi classifier is designed to recognize the current state of reaction. Under this condition, the SOC of MH hydrogen storage tank is calculated through combining the state classifier and SOC model. This proposed on-line SOC estimation procedure is validated with the real operation vehicles in both charging and discharging process. It is proved to be effective with the estimation error of 0.2% during charging and 4.29% of discharging.

AB The 5000 series non-heat-treatable Al -Mg alloys are widely used as structural members, because of excellent combination of weldability, corrosion resistance and mechanical properties. It is well known that these alloys can become susceptible to inter-granular stress corrosion cracking. In the previous paper, the authors revealed that hydrogen embrittlement (HE) takes place in weld corner (fusion zone adjacent to HAZ) in an MIG-welded joint of 5083 alloy. In this study, the base material and MIG-welded joint of the 5083 alloy were sensitized, and their resistance to HE was investigated by two methods: humid gas stress corrosion cracking (HG-SCC) and slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) tests. The results obtained were discussed, in comparison with the previous results obtained in the non-sensitized joint. Discussion was also made in terms of the difference of the two testing methods. Extension of HG-SCC cracks were observed for all sensitized 5083 alloy samples, base and welded samples tested in humid air, and hence HE was confirmed. Fractography and surface observation on the crack tip of HG-SCC revealed that the crack propagates in a transgranular manner. The extent of HG-SCC was greater in the present sensitized specimens in all the locations except the weld corner, but the position dependency has been the same: crack propagation amount was largest in the weld corner. On the other hand, SSRT test results did not indicate any reduction in ductility or strength when testing environment was changed from dry nitrogen gas to humid air. Therefore, it is concluded that HG-SCC test is more sensitive for detecting HE of 5083 alloy

ID AROMATIC-SUBSTITUTION
AB It has been found that 1-dialkylamino-8-(pyrrolyl-1)-naphthalenes 1 and 6, upon treatment with an equimolar amount of HBF4 under ambient conditions, produce 1-dialkylammonium salts which are transformed into 7,7-dialkyl-7H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]perimidine-7-ium tetrafluoroborates 5 and 7, respectively. The reaction proceeds in a highly selective manner and represents the first case of nucleophilic substitution of hydrogen in the initially inactivated pyrrole ring. The scope and limitations of the transformation, apparently operating due to the joint action of the "proximity effect" and proton catalysis, are outlined.

AB The use of friction stir welding (FSW) has proven to be an excellent alternative to join engineering components. Although FSW has had a significant development in recent years, challenges for new applications have been raised, such as offshore steel parts suffering hydrogen embrittlement in the gas and oil industry. Therefore, in this work, the microstructure, corrosion, and hydrogen-induced cracking were investigated in a two-pass FSW welded joint of API 5L X70 pipeline steel. The electrochemical results indicate an inhibitory effect on corrosion reaction because of a carbonate product generation in the steel surface. The polygonal ferritic and degenerated pearlite bands microstructure in the base metal fixed carbonate deposits in the steel surface. In the welded regions, the bainitic microstructure and the carbide particle distribution are less efficient in setting the weld surface carbonate deposit. HIC tests showed cracks initiation and propagation to be more prone in hard phases. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The disinfection efficiencies of a commercial mixture of peracetic acid against Escherichia coli were studied in laboratory scale experiments. The joint and separate action of two disinfectant agents, hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid, were evaluated in order to observe synergistic effects. A kinetic model for each component of the mixture and for the commercial mixture was proposed. Through simple mathematical equations, the model describes different stages of attack by disinfectants during the inactivation process. Based on the experiments and the kinetic parameters obtained, it could be established that the efficiency of hydrogen peroxide was much lower than that of peracetic acid alone. However, the contribution of hydrogen peroxide was very important in the commercial mixture. It should be noted that this improvement occurred only after peracetic acid had initiated the attack on the cell. This synergistic effect was successfully explained by the proposed scheme and was verified by experimental results. Besides providing a clearer mechanistic understanding of water disinfection, such models may improve our ability to design reactors.

AB A framework is planned to supply electrical and thermal loads by joint application of a hydrogen storage system (HSS) and a fuel cell. The system, including electrical and thermal loads, is connected to the upstream network. The bidirectional operation is defined for the system, and the system can buy energy from the grid or sell energy to the grid. A water electrolyzer is applied to produce hydrogen from water and store electricity in the form of hydrogen. The stored hydrogen supplies the thermal loads, as well as the fuel cell. The electrical loads are directly connected to the grid and are supplied by the grid. The electricity is received from the fuel cell at hours 17 to 22. When the price of electricity is high, the electrical loads can receive their power from the fuel cell rather than the grid. Additionally, any excess electricity may be sold to the grid. The uncertainty in the thermal and electrical loads is modeled and formulated as stochastic programming. The hydrogen is fed to the fuel cell and the thermal loads. The proposed model minimizes the daily operational cost of the system. The results demonstrate that the daily operational cost of the system is $22.274 USD/day. The bidirectional operation reduces the daily operational cost by about 79%. The unceratinty increases the cost by about 15%.

AB Using high energy density welding arc, the joining processmakes pipe joints involvingmelting of base metal. The thermal cycle could cause distortion and have residual stress around joints and there could be a prospect of hydrogen cracking. By employing proper heat treatment procedures, the physical, metallurgical, and mechanical properties of steel structures are regained for their long endurance under extreme operating conditions of pressure and temperature, particularly, in power industries. The joints need to undergo pre- and post-weld heat treatment. Induction heating is increasingly being used for heat treatment of pipes, tubes, pressure vessels, etc., made up of a special type of steel such as P91 Grade. As the popularity of the heat treatment process is on the rise, it is important to look into the energy efficiency and power delivery aspects of the system. This paper proposes an innovative method to configure the induction heating controller and the tank circuit so that the energy delivery to the pipe and its usage are inherently improved. The proposed ideas have been practically demonstrated using a 40-45 kW induction heater.

AB The increasing packaging density and power density have led to a drastic increase in the electric field strength between solder joints, and the accelerated movement of ions significantly rises the potential for failure of solder joints caused by electrochemical migration (ECM). To improve the anti-electrochemical migration ability of Sn3Ag0.5Cu solder (SAC305), we doped Cu6Sn5 nanoparticles (NPs) into SAC305 solder paste and studied its mechanism for inhibiting ECM. In this experiment, Cu6Sn5 NPs were prepared by ultrasound-assisted chemical reduction, and composite solder pastes were prepared by mechanically mixing Cu6Sn5 NPs with SAC305. In situ observation of the ECM between electrodes was carried out under different operating conditions. The addition of Cu6Sn5 NPs within 0.6 wt% could effectively inhibit the ECM by prolonging the incubation period. However, when the amount of Cu6Sn5 NPs exceeded 0.6 wt%, the catalytic effect of Cu6Sn5 NPs on the hydrogen evolution reaction would create vigorous convection within the droplet, which accelerated the failure by ECM. Apart from that, it was found that the addition of Cu6Sn5 NPs could increase the threshold for instantaneous failure of solder joints under high voltage.

TI Hydrogen atom scattering at the Al2O3(0001)
   surface: a combined experimental and theoretical study
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Investigating atom-surface interactions is the key to an in-depth understanding of chemical processes at interfaces, which are of central importance in many fields - from heterogeneous catalysis to corrosion. In this work, we present a joint experimental and theoretical effort to gain insights into the atomistic details of hydrogen atom scattering at the alpha-Al2O3(0001) surface. Surprisingly, this system has been hardly studied to date, although hydrogen atoms as well as alpha-Al2O3 are omnipresent in catalysis as reactive species and support oxide, respectively. We address this system by performing hydrogen atom beam scattering experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on a high-dimensional machine learning potential trained to density functional theory data. Using this combination of methods we are able to probe the properties of the multidimensional potential energy surface governing the scattering process. Specifically, we compare the angular distribution and the kinetic energy loss of the scattered atoms obtained in experiment with a large number of MD trajectories, which, moreover, allow to identify the underlying impact sites at the surface.

AB In the study of hydrogen bonds between noncoordinated and metal-coordinated ethylenediamine and a water molecule, the data in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) were analyzed and DFT calculations were performed. For coordinated ethylenediamine in the CSD, the analyzed distributions of d(OH) distances show a maximum in the range of 2.0-2.1 angstrom, while the angle alpha shows a maximum in the range of 150-160 degrees. The DFT calculations were done for octahedral geometries of cobalt(III), copper(II), and nickel(II) complexes and square-planar geometry of palladium(II) complexes. The coordination of ethylenediamine to the metal ions strengthens its hydrogen bond with the water molecule. Namely, noncoordinated ethylenediamine and the water molecule have an interaction energy of -2.3 kcal/mol, while for coordinated ethylenediamine, the interacting energy spans from -4.0 to -28.0 kcal/mol depending on the metal ion and charge of the complex. The hydrogen bond energies have a good correlation with the calculated electrostatic potential on the interacting hydrogen atom. The coordination number and oxidation states of the metal have a significant influence on the electrostatic potential on the interacting hydrogen atom and the energy of hydrogen bonds.

AB Pressureless sintering of nanosilver paste has been widely demonstrated for bonding power semiconductor devices on silver-or gold-coated substrates. In this paper, we extended the application of nanosilver bonding to bare copper surface by controlling sintering atmosphere in an effort to prevent surface oxidation of copper during sintering. Three different atmospheres were evaluated: 1) pure nitrogen (N-2); 2) nitrogen with 1 vol% oxygen (1% O-2/N-2); and 3) a forming gas consisting of 4 vol% hydrogen and 96 vol% nitrogen (4% H-2/N-2). The bonding strengths of sintered joints were evaluated by dieshear test. The joints sintered in 1% O-2/N-2 had the lowest average bonding strength of approximately 15 MPa due to the formation of copper oxide clearly visible on the failure surface of the substrate. The joints sintered in 4% H-2/N-2 had the highest average bonding strength of over 40 MPa. Microstructure characterization of the sintered joints showed that the bond-line density was strongly affected by the sintering atmosphere. The joints sintered in the forming gas had a denser microstructure than those sintered in pure nitrogen. It is believed that the higher sintered density is a result of catalytic hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of organic binder in the paste, which occurred at the sintering temperature with nanoparticles of silver as catalyst. This increase in microstructure density and prevention of copper surface oxidation led to the high bonding strength of the sintered joints formed on copper in the forming gas.

AB Hydrogen assisted fracture near welds is the result of a combination of microstructural changes and the accumulation of hydrogen. With the aim of predicting local hydrogen concentrations, hydrogen redistribution near a crack tip is simulated using a Boundary Layer approach and diffusion modelling is modified by trapping phenomena. The simulated non-homogeneous geometry includes layers that reproduce weld metal, heat affected zones and base metal of a 2.25Cr-1Mo steel; mechanical and diffusion properties have been extracted from references. The hydrogen transport model here considered involves a stress dependency that affects local concentrations; thus, the possible interaction between constraint effects associated to a graded material with hydrogen entry and transport is studied. Results show that the constraint effect is not significative for the loading and for the widths assigned to the weld and the heat affected zones (2.5 to 5 mm); however, for the HAZ-centred crack, a higher hydrostatic peak and the corresponding increase in lattice hydrogen are found. A two-type trapping process is also simulated to reproduce simultaneously the effect of dislocation trapping and micro-structure delayed diffusion. Hydrogen is weakly trapped in dislocations and it is added to the lattice concentration to obtain a measure of diffusible hydrogen near a crack tip while effective diffusivity is strongly reduced by deeply trapped hydrogen. Differences between environmental or internal hydrogen sources are expected to be more accurately captured because stress-dependent boundary conditions have been implemented for hydrogen uptake.

AB Mg(BH4)(2) is a promising solid-state hydrogen storage material, releasing 14.9 wt% hydrogen upon conversion to MgB2. Although several dehydrogenation pathways have been proposed, the hydrogenation process is less well understood. Here, we present a joint experimental-theoretical study that elucidates the key atomistic mechanisms associated with the initial stages of hydrogen uptake within MgB2. Fourier transform infrared, X-ray absorption, and X-ray emission spectroscopies are integrated with spectroscopic simulations to show that hydrogenation can initially proceed via direct conversion of MgB2 to Mg(BH4)(2) complexes. The associated energy landscape is mapped by combining ab initio calculations with barriers extracted from the experimental uptake curves, from which a kinetic model is constructed. The results from the kinetic model suggest that initial hydrogenation takes place via a multi-step process: molecular H-2 dissociation, likely at Mg-terminated MgB2 surfaces, is followed by migration of atomic hydrogen to defective boron sites, where the formation of stable B-H bonds ultimately leads to the direct creation of Mg(BH4)(2) complexes without persistent BxHy intermediates. Implications for understanding the chemical, structural, and electronic changes upon hydrogenation of MgB2 are discussed.

AB The artificial joints would go through serious wear after implantation surgery due to the poor lubrication of the body fluid, and the biomimetic lubricants directly injected in vitro is easy to be absorbed by human tissues, and after a period of time, it will lose its lubrication effect. However, the composite hydrogel with slow-release lubrication effect provides a new way for the lubrication of artificial joints. In this study, Graphene oxide/Poly (ethylene glycol) (GO/PEG) composites were prepared to improve the artificial joint lubrication, and through wrapped in the Chitosan/Sodium glycerophosphate (CS/GP) hydrogel, the GO/PEG lubricant will be released under the squeezing action, thus to prolong the service time of biomimetic lubricants. The friction experimental results showed that GO/PEG had better lubrication effect, and the average friction coefficient of the slow-release solution was below 0.03, especially with the pressure increasing. GO, PEG and small molecule GP in the slow release solution through hydrogen-bond interaction might form a particular structure, which led to the good lubricating effect. The experiments of cell and acute toxicity in vivo showed that GO and its composite hydrogel had good biocompatibility.

AB Silver-copper oxide reactive air brazes are the most widely used Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) brazes. However, the conventional Ag-4 wt.% Cu composition has a high wetting angle of similar to 40 degrees in air on yttriastabilized-zirconia (YSZ) that leads to manufacturing defects (denoted as Type I pores). Also, many elements that oxidize during brazing to promote braze wetting (such as Cu) are easily reduced by SOFC fuels. This results in Type II pores that decrease the braze interfacial strength and provide a quick path for hydrogen permeation into the braze (where the hydrogen reacts with diffused oxygen to form gaseous water pockets, denoted as Type Ill pores). The present work demonstrates that transient porous nickel interlayers, instead of reactive element additions, can be used to promote Ag wetting on YSZ and produce high-quality YSZ-stainless steel braze joints. Mechanical tests on these reactive-element-free, silver based SOFC braze joints, both before and after 500 h of 750 degrees C oxidation in air, show that the braze and braze interface strengths are higher than the underlying YSZ|NiO-YSZ substrate. The elimination of Type I and Type II porosity enabled by this new technique should result in improved braze lifetimes for SOFC and other ceramic-to-metal sealing applications.

AB As a new zero-carbon energy with high calorific value, hydrogen has attracted extensive attention in recent years. In this work, multiwalled carbon nanotubes modified molybdenum sulfide and molybdenum oxide heterostructure (MWCNTs-MoS2-MoO3) was obtained via a simple hydrothermal method. The low band gap of 0.02MWCNTs-MoS2-MoO3 (1.15 eV) endowed a good near-infrared (NIR) light response. The conduction band position of 0.02MWCNTs-MoS2-MoO3 (-0.63 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) was negative enough to produce hydrogen. Compared with pure MoS2, the formation of MoS2-MoO3 heterostructure and introduction of MWCNTs generated better photoelectrochemical activity and NIR irradiation improved photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) hydrogen evolution performance in wide pH range. The 0.02MWCNTs-MoS2-MoO3 had superior overpotential (68 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope (56 mV dec(-1)) in acidic media. The NIR improved PEC hydrogen evolution activity of 0.02MWCNTs-MoS2-MoO3 in acidic media could be ex-plained by Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. The presence of large amount of bridging S-2(2-) in 1 T/2 H phase MoS2 and the synergistic effect between MWCNTs and MoS2-MoO3 heterostructure made a joint effect on the photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). NIR irradiation could increase the charge transport rate. The introduction of MWCNTs and heterostructure formation could increase the charge transport rate and improve the electron and hole separation ability of 0.02MWCNTs-MoS2-MoO3 as well.

AB Since the fluctuation and uneven distribution of solar energy seriously restrict its integration in the power mix, it is of great significance to promote cross -regional solar energy consumption. Herein, an innovative route of largescale solar energy utilization is proposed, including full-spectrum solar hydrogen production and hybrid pipeline transport. Based on the spectral beam splitter, full-spectrum solar energy is efficiently converted into hydrogen through methanol steam reforming and water electrolysis. Then, the produced hydrogen is transported to the energy intensive areas by an existing natural gas pipeline to minimize the capital investment. A joint model of proposed system is established using AspenPlus/Matlab, and the thermodynamic and economic performances are investigated comprehensively. Results show that the proposed system demonstrates the highest energy and exergy efficiencies, reaching 32.35 % and 28.54 % respectively. Among all the cases, the dynamic payback period is the shortest at 6.92 years, as well as the net present value is highest at 3087.63 million US$ in the proposed system, followed by the case of trucking + shipping, and trucking + natural gas pipeline. Summarily, the proposed system allows better utilization of available solar energy without significant infrastructure investments, which highlights the strong potential of cross -regional utilization and production of renewable hydrogen.

AB Gas Tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process was employed for welding of Inconel 718 with two different shielding gases, namely argon (Ar) and argon with a 5 vol% hydrogen mixture (ArH) and two fillers viz., ERNiCrMo-10 and ERNiCrMo-4. The effects of gas composition and filler wires on the laves phase formation were studied in detail. The results revealed that hydrogen addition through ArH shielding gas mixture resulted in better grain refinement in the welds than pure Ar. The hydrogen addition induced a steep thermal gradient in the weld, which lowered the segregation of elements like Niobium (Nb) and Molybdenum (Mo) at the interdendritic regions. The laves phase formation in Mo-rich filler addition welds was minimized due to restriction of Nb segregation by Mo at the interdendritic region. Tensile test results indicated that the strength and ductility of the joints of both autogenous and filler added welds of Ar were higher than the ArH shielded welds. In the case of filler added welds, higher Mo content filler exhibited better tensile properties in both shielding gas combinations due to solid solution strengthening of Mo. Nano-sized hydrogen assisted cracks observed in ArH autogenous welds caused a reduction of strength and ductility.

AB The new generation pillow plate heat exchanger (PPHX) is a type of PHXs with a complex wavy structure with desirable thermal-hydraulic characteristics. For the main structure of PPHX, edge welding joints are usually a common and economical design. However, the stress concentration and presence of corrosive media often lead to premature failure of welding structure. In this study, the leakage failure of PHX after 80,000 hours of service was evaluated. The crack at the edge joints of corrugated 316L steel plates was detected by dye permeability detection. The failure of welding joints was studied by optical microscope, scanning electron microscope(SEM), EBSD and X-ray diffraction(XRD). The corrosion product was observed only at inside of the edge joints. The mud pattern morphology and EDS analysis of high Cl ion concentration(2.87 wt.%) on fracture surface revealed the stress corrosion cracking mechanism. Chloride and hydrogen ions were enriched as an occluded cell mechanism on the narrow gap between plates. The carbide precipitated on the grain boundary of the HAZ during the welding process, which initiates cracking under the crevice corrosion environment. Based on the studies carried out, a structure modification welding without narrow gap, duplex or ferrite stainless steel replace the 316L stainless steel, periodic inspection and strict deionization of cooling water were suggested to eliminate such failures.

DT Article
AB Objectives: This study used hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for the first time to examine differences in the metabolomic profile of stifle joint synovial fluid from dogs with cranial cruciate ligament rupture with and without meniscal injuries, in order to identify biomarkers of meniscal injury. Identifying a biomarker of meniscal injury could then ultimately be used to design a minimally invasive diagnostic test for meniscal injuries in dogs. Materials and Methods: Stifle joint synovial fluid was collected from dogs undergoing stifle joint surgery or arthrocentesis for lameness investigations. We used multi-variate statistical analysis using principal component analysis and univariate statistical analysis using one-way analysis of variance and analysis of co-variance to identify differences in the metabolomic profile between dogs with cranial cruciate ligament rupture and meniscal injury, cranial cruciate ligament rupture without meniscal injury, and neither cranial cruciate ligament rupture nor meniscal injury, taking into consideration clinical variables. Results: A total of 154 samples of canine synovial fluid were included in the study. Sixty-four metabolites were annotated to the hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy spectra. Six spectral regions were found to be significantly altered (false discovery rate adjusted P-value <0.05) between groups with cranial cruciate ligament rupture with and without meniscal injury, including three attributed to nuclear magnetic resonance mobile lipids [mobile lipid -CH3 (P=0.016), mobile lipid -n(CH3)3 (P=0.017), mobile unsaturated lipid (P=0.031)]. Clinical Significance: We identified an increase in nuclear magnetic resonance mobile lipids in the synovial fluid of dogs with meniscal injury which are of interest as potential biomarkers of meniscal injury.

AB A seamless pipe made of AISI 321 stainless steel represented a part of a transportation pipeline system for hydrogen-containing hot gas in a hydrocarbon cracking unit. After a service period of approximately 21 months, a segment of such pipe demonstrated the cracks, causing leakage and respective fire. For clarification of a failure root cause, various metallurgical investigations combined with numerical simulations have been applied. The results revealed that the rupture of seamless pipe was evidently influenced by hydrogen assisted cracking (HAC). An increased susceptibility of the alloy to HAC had to be attributed to its sensitive microstructure which was related to the occurrence of slip bands with a high quantity in austenite grains, particularly in the specific region underneath the outer wall surface. In addition, the intensity of restraint resulting from the T-joint weld configuration caused respectively higher triaxial stresses in the confined area on the outer wall surface where the crack started. The numerical simulations of hydrogen diffusion revealed that a uniform hydrogen concentration profile over the pipe wall thickness was reached when the service period was more than 20 months. This duration agreed well to the time-to-failure of the actual component. Considering additionally that the final stage of rupture by overload was preceded by severe HAC, as confirmed by the respective intergranular fracture topography.

AB In this study, the weldability of high-hardness armor steel by the gas metal arc welding method has been investigated. The study was aimed at determining the weakness points of manual welding compared to automated welding through microhardness testing, the cooling rate, tensile characteristics and nondestructive analysis. Detailed studies were performed for automated welding on the impact energy and microhardness in the fusion line, as the most sensitive zone of the armor steel weld joint. It was demonstrated that the selection of the preheating and interpass temperature is important in terms of the cooling rate and quantity of diffusible and retained hydrogen in the weld joint. The tensile strength was higher than 800 MPa. The width of the heat-affected zone did not exceed 15.9 mm, measured from the weld centerline, while the impact energy results were 74 and 39 J at 20 and - 40 A degrees C, respectively.

AB The present study investigated the impact on a CRDI engine of adding hydrogen and synthetic antioxidant tertbutylhydroquinone (TBHQ) in waste cooking biodiesel under varying load conditions. Concentrations of 1000-2500 ppm of antioxidant TBHQ were added to the evaluated fuels using ultra-sonication. Hydrogen injection is kept at a constant flow rate of 10L/min. XRD analysis is used to determine the antioxidant's crystalline structure. Results revealed that adding TBHQ in the B20 sample (20% biodiesel and 80% diesel) has lowered the BSFC and increased the BTE, but there has been an increase in emissions such as smoke, CO, and HC. Antioxidant TBHQ at a concentration of 2000 ppm has been observed to attain the highest oxidation stability and also lower the maximum NOx emission. However, a decline has been observed in in-cylinder pressure (ICP) and heat release rate (HRR). In comparison with diesel, the joint effect of hydrogen and TBHQ has improved the BTE by 7.39% for the blend B20 + 2000 ppm + H2, and BSFC decreased by 11%. Hydrogen enrichment and higher antioxidant content in B20 have reduced the emissions of NOx by 3.63% than diesel. The blend B20 + 1000 ppm + H2 shows a 1.93% higher peak pressure than diesel. Thus, hydrogen-enriched and antioxidant-added biodiesel might be considered a fossil fuel substitute and benefit diesel engine performance.

ID MICROSTRUCTURE
AB In general, the ultrasonic techniques have been used to determine the mechanical properties of materials based on their relationship with metallurgical characteristics. In this research work, the relationship between ultrasonic wave velocity, hardness and the microstructure of steel pipeline welded joints is investigated. Measurements of ultrasonic wave velocity were made as a function of the location across the weld. Hardness measurements were performed in an attempt to correlate with ultrasonic response. In addition, the coarse and dendritic grain structure of the weld material is extreme and unpredictably anisotropic. Thus, due to the acoustic anisotropy of the crystal, weld material of studied joints is anisotropic too. Such structure is no longer direction-independent to the ultrasonic wave propagation; therefore, the ultrasonic beam deflects and redirects and the wave front becomes distorted. Thus, the use of conventional ultrasonic testing techniques using fixed beam angles is very limited and the application of conventional ultrasonic phased array techniques becomes desirable. This technique is proposed to assist pipeline operators in estimating the hardness through ultrasonic measures to evaluate the susceptibility to stress sulphide cracking and hydrogen-induced cracking due to hard spots in steel pipeline welded joints in service. Sound wave velocity and hardness measurements have been carried out on a steel welded joint. For each section of the welding, weld bead, fusion zone, heat affected zone and base metal were found to correspond particular values of the ultrasound velocity. These results were correlated with electron microscopy observations of the microstructure and sectorial scan view of welded joints by ultrasonic phased array.

AB The effects of thermal exposure at 600 degrees C and subsequent electrolytic hydrogen charging at ambient temperature were studied in terms of their influence on notch-tensile properties and fracture behaviour of individual heat-affected zones (HAZ) of Ni-based transition weldments between T24 and T92 creep-resistant steels. The experimental welded joints were prepared by gas tungsten arc welding using "Inconel-type" filler metal Nirod 600. Post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) was carried out at 720 degrees C for 2 h, followed by passive cooling within tempering furnace. Subsequent long-term ageing of two series of prepared T24/T92 dissimilar welds at 600 degrees C for 1000 and 5000 h, respectively, led to gradual changes in both T24 and T92 HAZ microstructures, which were mainly related to their additional tempering accompanied by the coarsening of original precipitates as well as newly-formed secondary phases. The observed thermally-induced microstructural changes together with subsequently applied hydrogen charging effects resulted in complex variations in tensile properties and fracture behaviour of individual HAZ regions related to the pre-existing differences in their initial tempering grade due to the used PWHT procedure.

AB This study reports a novel integrated system for power generation with on-site produced hydrogen and heat recovery. The main equipment of the integrated system includes a steam methane reforming (SMR) reactor for hydrogen production, a palladium membrane (Pd-M) unit for hydrogen purification, a waste heat collector (HC) unit for heat recovery, and a low-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (LT-PEMFC) for power generation. ASPEN Plus and MATLAB/Simulink jointed simulation model is used to establish an accurate model for the whole integrated system. Moreover, for the SMR reactor, it is found that the RPlug reactor simulation module is more appropriate compared with the RGibb module. Then a detailed parametric analysis is carried out to estimate the effects of hydrogen utilization, the SMR reactor operating temperature, and the current density of the PEMFC stack on the overall energy and exergy efficiency of the integrated system. Finally, thermodynamic analysis is performed on the integrated system with S/C of 3.0, SMR reaction temperature of 700 degrees C, PEMFC hydrogen utilization rate of 0.8, and power generation of 520 W, delivering energy and exergy efficiencies as high as 47.4% and 45.7% under these operating parameters. The thermodynamic analysis shows that the PEMFC stack is the primary source of the system exergy destruction (326.27 W) with 34.33% of the relative exergy destruction ratio.

ID FAILURE ANALYSIS
AB The Longitudinal fractures or splits in tool joint box of drill pipe often occur, because the numbers of deep, directional, extended and horizontal oil wells are increasing. The mechanism of frictional heat check cracking of drill pipe tool joints was discussed in the standard API RP 7G. However, authors have identified that heat check cracking was just one of the cracking initiation mechanism, not crack propagation mechanism. This paper has reviewed 21 cases of this kind of failure analyzed by authors from year 2000 to 2015. Fracture surfaces and mechanical properties have been examined in this paper. It was found that there were various other causes of crack initiation, in addition to frictional heat check cracking, such as tong tooth bite marks and friction damage in internal threads. Such cracks propagated mostly via stress corrosion cracking (SCC) mechanism, although two cases was brittle cracking due to poor material toughness. The stress corrosion mechanism was related to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) or ionic sulfur (S2-), which came from the degradation of applied thread greases or drilling fluid ingredients. Although heat check cracks and tooth bite marks as crack initiation are common-place, the failure can be prevented through prevention of crack propagation. Failure data showed that although improved transverse material absorbed energy avoided longitudinal brittle cracking of the tool joint, stress corrosion cracking still occurred. The statistical analysis results showed that material hardness was related to the longitudinal cracking of drill pipe tool joints. It was demonstrated that if material hardness was restricted to less than HB310, the crack did not propagate.

TI Evidence for asymmetric reionization histories from a joint analysis of

AB We show that by jointly fitting cosmic microwave background (CMB) and astrophysical data-a compilation of UV luminosity data from the Hubble Frontier Field and neutral hydrogen data from distant source-we can infer on the shape of the evolution of the ionized hydrogen fraction with redshift, in addition to constraining the average optical depth tau. For this purpose, we introduce here a novel extended model that includes hydrogen ionization histories which are monotonic with redshift, but allow for an asymmetry, as indicated from our previous works on a free-form reconstruction of reionization. By using than the one inferred by Planck 2018 data because of the combination of CMB with astrophysical data. We find that the symmetric hypothesis within our parametrization is disfavored at 4 sigma. We test our findings by using alternative likelihoods for CMB polarization at low multipoles, i.e. based on the 2020 reprocessing of Planck high frequency instrument data or on the joint analysis of Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe and Planck low frequency instrument data, obtaining consistent results that disfavor the symmetric hypothesis of the reionization history at a high statistically significant level. These results will be further tested by more precise astrophysical data such as that from JWST and Euclid deep fields.

AB Mass spectrometry with hydrogen-radical-mediated fragmentation techniques has been used for the sequencing of proteins/peptides. The two methods, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization in-source decay (MALDI-ISD) and hydrogen attachment/abstraction dissociation (HAD) are known as hydrogen-radical-mediated fragmentation techniques. MALDI-ISD occurs during laser induced desorption processes, whereas HAD utilizes the association of hydrogen with peptide ions in the gas phase. In this study, the general mechanisms of MALDI-ISD and HAD of peptides were investigated. We demonstrated the fragmentation of four model peptides and investigated the fragment formation pathways using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The current experimental and computational joint study indicated that MALDI-ISD and HAD produce aminoketyl radical intermediates, which immediately undergo radical-induced cleavage at the N-C-alpha bond located on the C-terminal side of the radical site, leading to the c'/z(center dot) fragment pair. In the case of MALDI-ISD, the z(center dot) fragments undergo a subsequent reaction with the matrix to give z' and matrix adducts of the z fragments. In contrast, the c' and z(center dot) fragments react with hydrogen atoms during the HAD processes, and various fragment species, such as c(center dot), c', z(center dot) and z', were observed in the HAD-MS/MS mass spectra.

AB Nondestructive testing is an integral part of quality assurance for critical products. The complex structure of metal-polymer hydrogen cylinders complicates the reliable detection of defects using a single type of flaw detection. In this regard, the application of combined nondestructive testing is of interest. This study examines the joint use of ultrasonic and thermal flaw detection with the synthesis of their results. Experimental verification demonstrated that the developed methodology for synthesizing ultrasonic and thermal testing data improved defect detectability compared to the separate use of these nondestructive testing methods.

AB IR spectroscopy, X-ray phase analysis, and high-resolution electron microscopy were used to examine the nature of the interaction of organic acids with silicates in their joint mechanical activation for the example of succinic acid. It was found that mechanocomposites with chemically bound components are formed in the course of activation of acid-layered silicate mixtures. It was shown that in the acid/nano-SiO2 composite, monomer molecules of the acid are bound to nano-SiO2 via molecules of adsorbed water, which form rather strong hydrogen bonds with the basic active centers of nano-SiO2 and hydroxy groups of the monomer molecules of the acid.

AB Nucleic acids can fold into well-defined 3D structures that help determine their function. Knowing precise nucleic acid structures can also be used for the design of nucleic acid-based therapeutics. However, locations of hydrogen atoms, which are key players of nucleic acid function, are normally not determined with X-ray crystallography. Accurate determination of hydrogen atom positions can provide indispensable information on protonation states, hydrogen bonding, and water architecture in nucleic acids. Here, we used neutron crystallography in combination with X-ray diffraction to obtain joint X-ray/neutron structures at both room and cryo temperatures of a self-complementary A-DNA oligonucleotide d[GTGG(C-se)CAC](2) containing 2'-SeCH3 modification on Cyt5 (C-se) at pH 5.6. We directly observed protonation of a backbone phosphate oxygen of Ade7 at room temperature. The proton is replaced with hydrated Mg2+ upon cooling the crystal to 100 K, indicating that metal binding is favored at low temperature, whereas proton binding is dominant at room temperature.

AB Cold metal transfer (CMT) welding of AlSi7Mg alloy sheets prepared by selective laser melting (SLM) was employed using ER4047 and ER5356 filler wire. Effect of the filler wires on hydrogen pores, microstructures and mechanical properties of welded joints was studied. As a result, CMT welding of AlSi7Mg alloy sheets using ER5356 wire reduces the porosity, refines the grains, increases the fraction of high angle grain boundaries (HAGBs), modifies the eutectic Si-rich morphology, and improves the solid solution strengthening of Si elements in the alpha-Al matrix of the microstructures in the weld metal (WM). Additionally, the morphology of eutectic Si-rich phases in heat affected zone (HAZ) of the welded joint is noticeably changed from the continuous cellular networks in base metal (BM) to totally globularized particles, as a result of the increased welding heat effect with decreasing distance to the WM. Compared with the ER4047 wire, the welded joint with ER5356 wire achieves higher WM hardness and higher ultimate tensile strength (UTS), which have been increased by 13.9 % and 18.6 %, respectively. The enhanced mechanical properties of the welded joints with ER5356 wire are mainly attributed to the reduced porosity and the improved microstructures in the WM.

AB Underwater welding is widely used for maintenance and repairs of underwater structures such as undersea pipes, offshore structures and nuclear power plants. In practice, underwater welding has the disadvantage related to high cooling rate and unstable welding arc due to the water hydrostatic pressure. This affects the microstructure and mechanical properties of underwater welded joints. Many of previous research works on underwater welding have been carried out only on a laboratory scale in shallow water depth, whereas underwater welding was used to weld in the depth of the water with a metre scale. Undersea structures experience fatigue load due to the fluctuation force of water flow. Therefore, this study aims to determine the effect of water depth on the fatigue life of underwater welded joints. Low carbon steel SS400 specimens were welded underwater with depths of 2.5 m, 5 m and 10 m. The air welded joint was also evaluated for comparison purposes. Fatigue life was evaluated according to the ASTM E466 standard by using a rotary bending machine. Furthermore, tensile test, micro hardness measurement and microstructure evaluation were also conducted for gathering supporting data. The fatigue and tensile strength of the air welded joints were higher than those of the underwater welded joints. The porosities caused by the dissolved hydrogen gas, carbon (monoxide and dioxide) gases and water vapor in weld metal of the underwater welded joints decreased the fatigue and tensile strength. An interesting phenomenon on the underwater welded joints was that the deeper the water level, the higher became the fatigue, tensile strength as well as hardness. Based on the microstructure analysis, the number of acicular ferrite structures in weld metal increased as the water level depth increased.

TI Characteristics of Welding Residual Stress Distribution in Dissimilar

DT Article
DE cryogenic steel; welding residual stress; dissimilar joint; analytical
   method; LNG storage tank
AB For the construction of ecofriendly ships, fuels such as liquefied natural gas (LNG), ammonia, and hydrogen are being discussed as alternatives. LNG fuel has recently been applied to shipbuilding. The most important aspect of an LNG propulsion ship is the LNG storage tank, because LNG is stored at a high pressure and low temperature. Cryogenic steels are needed to evaluate safety in weld joints, especially the LNG storage tank which has a dissimilar weld joint with a STS pipe. The dissimilar weld joint has a complex welding residual stress distribution. It is necessary to evaluate the effects of temperature changes that occur during the loading-unloading process of LNG. In this study, the residual stress distribution characteristics of heterogeneous welding parts welded to STS pipes using 9% Ni steel, STS, and high-manganese austenitic steel in an LNG storage tank were investigated through experimental and analytical methods. The thermal stress due to the difference in thermal expansion coefficient between cryogenic steel and the STS pipe occurred with a small amount in loading-unloading of LNG. When high-manganese austenitic steels and the STS pipe were joined, tensile stress was generated at the dissimilar weld joint owing to the temperature difference generated during the LNG loading-unloading process. STS has a homogenous weld joint and identical thermal expansion coefficients; therefore, the shrinkage and expansion were not affected by the temperature change. The welding residual stress at the dissimilar weld joints was measured via an experimental cutting method, and the results indicated that the tensile residual stress had distribution similar to the yield stress of the material. The stress generated by the temperature change and the welding residual stress overlapped and occurred during the loading-unloading process of the LNG tank; however, the final tensile stress below the tensile stress was distributed in the storage tank.

AB Welding at low atmospheric temperatures is frequently needed for the construction of steel structures in cold regions. In this work, the Charpy impact test in parallel with metallurgical observation was carried out to evaluate the low temperature impact fracture energy of structural steel welded joints constructed at low ambient temperatures. The impact fracture energy at low temperatures of structural steel joints welded at room temperature was also investigated for comparison. Standard V-notch Charpy impact specimens were prepared and tested under dynamic loading condition. The effects of low climatic temperatures during welding on the low temperature impact fracture energy of structural steel welded joints were explored based on the absorbed energies and the microstructures, from which the feasibility of welding in cold weather was assessed. Referring to the results, significant drop of the low temperature impact fracture energy at the heat affected zone occurs due to the rapid cooling effects. Nevertheless, it is confirmed that the impact fracture energy of structural steel welded joints constructed at low ambient temperatures can be guaranteed for use in cold regions provided that proper precautions such as the use of low-hydrogen electrodes and suitable thermal control are taken during the welding process.

AB Photochemical hydrogen generation from water is a promising solution to concurrently tackle energy and environmental problems. However, the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies of most photocatalysts are still unsatisfactory due to two major limiting factors: the non-ideal band structure of photocatalysts and the fast recombination of photo-generated charge carriers. Herein, we report a Janus-type TiO2 heterojunction consisting of ordered blue-anatase and disordered black-rutile phases fabricated by the magnesiothermic reduction process. In this process, the surface enthalpy difference of rutile and anatase phases in P25-TiO2 allows the phase-selective reduction to afford novel blue ordered/disordered Janus heterostructure. The joint effect of the improved light absorption and charge separation by the disordered black-rutile phase and the high catalytic activity of the ordered blue-anatase phase, as well as the morphological advantage over order@disorder core-shell structures, significantly enhances the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate to 1.56 mmol h(-1) g(-1) (11.53 mmol h(-1) g(-1) with similar to 1 wt% Pt), which delivers 13-fold enhancement compared to pristine P25-TiO2.

AB With the growing sophistication of offshore wind technology, the development of offshore wind-hydrogen system is evolving as a cost-efficient approach to harnessing far offshore wind resource. However, the costs associated with inter-array cables, the offshore hydrogen production platform (OHPP) and the hydrogen pipeline constitute a substantial portion of the capital expenditure (CAPEX) for this hybrid system, underscoring the critical need for optimization in the distribution and transmission system design of offshore wind-hydrogen system. In this study, we introduce an integrated design model for the distribution and transmission system of this hybrid system, considering local wind conditions and various hydrogen production efficiencies, with the aim of minimizing investment cost, expected power losses cost and expected fault loss cost. Given the complexity of this problem, we employ a double-layer framework for solutions. The upper layer utilizes rigorous mathematical proofs to clarify the relationship between optimal OHPP capacity and its location. Meanwhile, the lower layer addresses a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem for jointly optimizing the cable connection layout and OHPP position. Due to its intractability, we construct a relaxed mixed-integer secondorder cone programming (MISOCP) model and rigorously prove that its optimal solution aligns with that of the original problem. In our computational experiments, we found that the integrated design model reduces expected costs by an average of 3.88 % compared to solving subproblems separately. Compared with other optimization methods, our optimization framework is both concise and efficient, capable of finding a globally optimal solution within an acceptable timeframe. Lastly, sensitivity analysis reveals that even a slight increase in hydrogen production efficiency can significantly reduce expected costs, each 1 % improvement in efficiency reduces total cost by 0.94 %.

AB Modern arc processes, such as the modified spray arc (Mod. SA), have been developed for gas metal arc welding of high-strength structural steels with which even narrow weld seams can be welded. High-strength joints are subjected to increasingly stringent requirements in terms of welding processing and the resulting component performance. In the present work, this challenge is to be met by clarifying the influences on hydrogen-assisted cracking (HAC) in a high-strength structural steel S960QL. Adapted samples analogous to the self-restraint TEKKEN test are used and analyzed with respect to crack formation, microstructure, diffusible hydrogen concentration and residual stresses. The variation of the seam opening angle of the test seams is between 30 degrees and 60 degrees. To prevent HAC, the effectiveness of a dehydrogenation heat treatment (DHT) from the welding heat is investigated. As a result, the weld metals produced at reduced weld opening angle show slightly higher hydrogen concentrations on average. In addition, increased micro- as well as macro-crack formation can be observed on these weld metal samples. On all samples without DHT, cracks in the root notch occur due to HAC, which can be prevented by DHT immediately after welding.

AB The energy production market based on hydrogen technologies is an innovative solution that will allow the industry to achieve climate neutrality in the future in Poland and in the world. The paper presents the idea of using hydrogen as a modern energy carrier, and devices that, in cooperation with renewable energy sources, produce the so-called green hydrogen and the applicable legal acts that allow for the implementation of the new technology were analyzed. Energy transformation is inevitable, and according to reports on good practices in European Union countries, hydrogen and the hydrogen value chain (production, transport and transmission, storage, use in transport, and energy) have wide potential. Thanks to joint projects and subsidies from the EU, initiatives supporting hydrogen technologies are created, such as hydrogen clusters and hydrogen valleys, and EU and national strategic programs set the main goals. Poland is one of the leaders in hydrogen production both in the world and in Europe. Domestic tycoons from the energy, refining, and chemical industries are involved in the projects. Eight hydrogen valleys that have recently been created in Poland successfully implement the assumptions of the "Polish Hydrogen Strategy until 2030 with a perspective until 2040" and "Energy Policy of Poland until 2040", which are in line with the assumptions of the most important legal acts of the EU, including the European Union's energy and climate policy, the Green Deal, and the Fit for 55 Package. The review of the analysis of the development of hydrogen technologies in Poland shows that Poland does not differ from other European countries. As part of the assumptions of the European Hydrogen Strategy and the trend related to the management of energy surpluses, electrolyzers with a capacity of at least 6 GW will be installed in Poland in 2020-2024. It is also assumed that in the next phase, planned for 2025-2030, hydrogen will be a carrier in the energy system in Poland. Poland, as a member of the EU, is the creator of documents that take into account the assumptions of the European Union Commission and systematically implement the assumed goals. The strategy of activities supporting the development of hydrogen technologies in Poland and the value chain includes very extensive activities related to, among others, obtaining hydrogen, using hydrogen in transport, energy, and industry, developing human resources for the new economy, supporting the activities of hydrogen valley stakeholders, building hydrogen refueling stations, and cooperation among Poland, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic as part of the HydrogenEagle project.

AB High-temperature steam electrolysis (HTSE) consists of the splitting of steam into hydrogen and oxygen at high temperature in solid oxide electrolyzers. Performing the electrolysis process at high temperatures offers the advantage of achieving higher efficiencies as compared to the conventional water electrolysis. Furthermore, this allows the direct use of process heat to generate steam. This paper is related to the FCH JU (Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking) project ADEL (ADvanced ELectrolyser For hydrogen Production with Renewable Energy Sources), which investigates different carbon-free energy sources to be coupled to the HTSE process. Renewable energy sources are able to provide the high-temperature steam electrolysis (HTSE) process with heat and power. This paper investigates the capability of Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) technologies to provide the HTSE process with the necessary energy demand. The layout of the plant is shown in the following figure. The design of commercial-scale high-temperature steam electrolysis has been carried out. The HTSE plant is coupled to an air cooled solar tower. The configuration and the operating parameters of the solar tower are based on those of the solar tower of Julich (Germany), which is operated by DLR. This paper presents the results of process analysis performed to evaluate the hydrogen production from a HTSE plant coupled to an 80MWth air solar tower. Additionally, the dynamic behavior of the system during energy fluctuations has been analyzed. The receiver-to-hydrogen efficiency (based on the Higher Heating Value of hydrogen) is 26% at a hydrogen production rate of 680kg/h in steady-state operation. The overall solar-to-hydrogen efficiency is calculated to be at 18%. Moreover, the analysis under transient conditions shows that a steady-state operation of the plant is only possible for 8h.

AB Hydrogen has attracted much attention from governments and enterprises around the world due to its zero pollution and recycling use. However, it may bring safety problems such as hydrogen jet fire due to its wide flammability range and low ignition energy. Therefore, the methods of preventing hydrogen jet fire need to be explored urgently. In order to investigate the effect of gaseous fire extinguishing agent on the hydrogen jet fire, a series of experiments were carried out to study the flame behaviors under the effects of nitrogen and carbon dioxide jets. The fire extinguishing agents were released through a jet nozzle with diameter of 3 mm at the pressure of 11 atm. The flame length, thermal radiant flux and total heat flux were analyzed. The results show that the reduction ratio of vertical flame length increases with the decrease of the installation height of the extinguishing agent nozzle. It indicates that when the fire extinguishing agent is injected at the root of hydrogen jet flame, the fire may be extinguished. Due to the reduction of flame size, the thermal radiant flux received by the radiometer decreases, which corresponds to the reduction of flame radiation fraction. The total heat flux received in the downstream region of deflected flame is determined by the joint action of thermal radiation and convection. The convective heat transfer of high-temperature gas may cause the value measured by the heat flux meter on the flow path of the deflected flame to increase. Besides, the extinguishing limit for hydrogen jet flame under the effects of nitrogen and carbon dioxide jets are analyzed.

AB In this study, a special phenomenon of gas evolution in the metal droplet and melt pool during underwater wet welding was investigated by in-situ imaging method in a simulated deep-water environment. In general, the dissolved hydrogen escaped from molten droplet and molten pool in the form of bubbles during molten metal solidification. As the increase of hydrostatic pressure, the gas cannot expand enough to burst the droplet and release gas, but instead of entering into molten pool again. The combinations of the internal pressure in the bubble and hydrogen-rich atmosphere induced by welding arc resulted in that the melt pool has been subjected to dual influences. The diffusible hydrogen content in the deposited metal significantly increased from 23.3 to 66.3 ml/100 g with increasing the water depth to 150 m, which was related to the high hydrogen partial pressure and the rapid solidification rate of molten metal.

AB Mn-Ni/TiO2 catalysts were prepared using a joint precipitation method with acid-dissolved titanium slag as raw material for selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxide. The joint precipitation method was accomplished with different precipitants, such as sodium hydroxide, carbamide, ammonia, or hydrogen peroxide. The deNOx activities of the catalysts prepared by different precipitants were investigated with SCR activity reactor within temperatures of 90-350 degrees C. It is evident that the Mn-Ni/TiO2 catalyst with carbamide-ammonia-hydrogen peroxide as precipitant has superior catalytic activity, which the NO conversion can reach 90% at 120 degrees C, with a wider temperature window (120-300 degrees C) for the NH3-SCR reaction. H-2-TPR results showed that the reduction potential of MnOx species on Mn-Ni/TiO2 catalysts is increased compared to that of Mn/TiO2 catalysts. Oxygen mobility is enhanced by interaction between Ni and Mn atoms due to use of carbamide-ammonia peroxide as precipitant. XPS results suggest that the presence of MnO2 is the major phase in nickel-doped Mn/TiO2 catalysts. Our NH3-TPD results illustrated that the catalysts have a lot of acid-active sites, which lead to attracting more ammonia to participate in the catalytic reaction.

AB Co-exposure of widely used single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and ubiquitous cadmium (Cd) to humans through ambient air is unavoidable. Studies on joint toxicity of SWCNTs and Cd in human cells are scarce. We aimed to investigate the joint effects of SWCNTs and Cd in human lung epithelial (A549) cells. Results showed that SWCNTs were safe while Cd induce significant toxicity to A549 cells. Remarkably, Cd-induced cell viability reduction, lactate dehydrogenase leakage, cell cycle arrest, dysregulation of apoptotic gene (p53, bax, bcl-2, casp3, and casp9), and mitochondrial membrane potential depletion were significantly mitigated following SWCNTs co-exposure. Cd-induced intracellular level of reactive oxygen species, hydrogen peroxide, and lipid peroxidation were significantly attenuated by SWCNT co-exposure. Moreover, glutathione depletion and lower activity of antioxidant enzymes after Cd exposure were also effectively abrogated by co-exposure of SWCNTs. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry study indicated that higher adsorption of Cd on SCWNTs might decreased cellular uptake and the toxic potential of Cd in A549 cells. Our work warranted further research to explore the potential mechanism of joint effects of SWCNTs and Cd at in vivo levels.

ID HYDROGEN
AB In many reactor containments Passive Autocatalytic Recombiners (PAR) are installed to mitigate the hydrogen threat in case of a severe nuclear reactor accident. PARs oxidize hydrogen catalytically into water vapor. The heat of catalytic reaction drives flow through the PAR unit by natural convection, which continuously brings "fresh" hydrogen-air mixtures to the PAR unit, thereby developing a self-sustained process until either hydrogen or oxygen falls below a minimum concentration. The test series (HR-33 to HR-35) of the OECD/NEA THAI-2 program investigated the influence of temperature, pressure and steam on the onset of hydrogen recombination in case of low or extremely low oxygen concen-trations. These conditions with oxygen concentrations below 1 vol-% can occur in accident scenarios (e.g. late accident phase with molten core concrete interaction). A better understanding of the PAR performance in oxygen-limited conditions is important for hydrogen management in severe accidents. The test data of HR-35 was used for a blind benchmark exercise within the OECD/NEA joint project. Lumped parameter codes (MELCOR and COCOSYS) have been used as well as 3D/CFD codes (GASFLOW, GOTHIC and CFX). A variety of PAR models were used, including models based on engineering correlations, models with a detailed nodalization of the PAR unit, and a model with detailed heat and mass transfer process (REKO-DIREKT). Consequently, the benchmark provided a good opportunity to assess the PAR models that are deployed in the state of the art safety analysis tools, especially under conditions representative for the late phase of a severe accident.

AB Nanoporous carbons remain the most promising candidates for effective hydrogen storage by physisorption in currently foreseen hydrogen-based scenarios of the world's energy future. An optimal sorbent meeting the current technological requirement has not been developed yet. Here we first review the storage limitations of currently available nanoporous carbons, then we discuss possible ways to improve their storage performance. We focus on two fundamental parameters determining the storage (the surface accessible for adsorption and hydrogen adsorption energy). We define numerically the values nanoporous carbons have to show to satisfy mobile application requirements at pressures lower than 120 bar. Possible necessary modifications of the topology and chemical compositions of carbon nanostructures are proposed and discussed. We indicate that pore wall fragmentation (nano-size graphene scaffolds) is a partial solution only, and chemical modifications of the carbon pore walls are required. The positive effects (and their limits) of the carbon substitutions by B and Be atoms are described. The experimental 'proof of concept' of the proposed strategies is also presented. We show that boron substituted nanoporous carbons prepared by a simple arc-discharge technique show a hydrogen adsorption energy twice as high as their pure carbon analogs. These preliminary results justify the continuation of the joint experimental and numerical research effort in this field.

AB Hydrogen production plus purification has been studied by the joint use of methane dry reforming (MDR) and the reduction-oxidation of iron oxides (Steam-Iron Process or SIP) within the same reactor. The raw material studied has been an equimolar mixture of CH4 and CO2 simulating the composition of a biogas exempt of any other contaminant. The study has been mainly carried out by thermogravimetry, using mixtures of a catalyst and a doped iron oxide both synthesized in laboratory. The catalyst has been based in a nickel aluminate with nickel oxide in excess above its stoichiometric composition. The iron oxide indirectly "stores'' the hydrogen produced by MDR by becoming into its metallic state during the reduction step. This hydrogen is released later on during the oxidation step of the metal with steam. On this way, dry reforming reaction is displaced towards products (H-2 and CO) which are consumed "on site'' by the oxide. This cyclic process has demonstrated that the key issue to achieve the goal of hydrogen purity enough to be consumed in a PEMFC, is producing a metallic iron with low coke deposition and an acceptable inert role. The nature of the coke and the way in which it is deposited, have also been studied in this work. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The forming, microstructure, mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of three kinds of vacuum electron beam welded joints with different shapes were studied. The results of X-ray inspection of the joints showed that the three shapes of welded joints could meet the requirements of the quality inspection. The results of microstructure characterization show that the worm or bone-like 8-ferrite appears in the upper and lower regions of the funnel-shaped and bell-shaped joints, while only a small amount of 8-ferrite appears in the local regions of the nail-shaped joints. The test results of mechanical properties show that the micro-hardness of the weld center in the three kinds of shaped joints is the lowest. All the specimens fracture in the weld, and the bell-shaped weld presents the highest impact energy and bending load. Funnel-shaped weld shows the worst corrosion resistance due to the element segregation of the weld. Thus, the bell-shaped joint exhibits the best comprehensive performance.

AB A hydrogenated Zr interlayer was formed by cathodic charging and was subsequently used to facilitate the diffusion bonding of TC4 alloy. The microstructure and phase composition of the hydrogenated Zr were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetry (TG). The hydride gamma phase precipitated from the supersaturated alpha(H) phase when the alpha(H) phase was charged with 0.15 wt.% hydrogen. When the hydrogen content reached 0.3 wt.%, the gamma phase completely transformed into the epsilon phase. The effects of hydrogen on the microstructure evolution and on the mechanical properties of the diffusion bonds were investigated by XRD and by scanning electron microscopy in conjunction with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). The interdiffusion coefficient and activation energy of the Ti-hydrogenated Zr diffusion couple were calculated using the Boltzmann-Matano method and Arrhenius' law. According to the experimental and computational results, the thickness of the diffusion layer and the shear strength of the diffusion bond increased drastically with increasing hydrogen content. Specifically, when 0.3 wt.% hydrogen was added into the Zr interlayer, the thicknesses of the diffusion layers of the joints bonded at 650 degrees C and 700 degrees C increased by 5 times and 1.2 times, respectively. The activation energy at the Zr-rich end was reduced by approximately 40 kJ mol(-1), and the interdiffusion coefficient increased accordingly by two orders of magnitude. Mechanisms for the hydrogen-induced enhancement of diffusion bonding are proposed. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Al/CFRP composite structure has the advantage of lightweight and high specific strength, making it a promising material for aviation, railway, and automotive applications. Silane coupling pretreatment is a chemical surface pretreatment method that can improve the mechanical properties of the Al/CFRP friction stir lap welding (FSLW) joint. To further investigate the strengthening mechanism of silane-treated Al/CFRP FSLW joint, a 6061-T6 Al/ CF-PA66 FSLW experiment was carried out and the finite element analysis (FEA) was used. The thermophysical properties of semi-crystalline resin during the welding process were also considered. The joining mechanism of silane surface pretreated Al/CFRP FSLW joints was further revealed by comparing the changes in interface morphology, temperature, stress, and mechanical properties. The results indicated that the silane coupling agent forms a silane film by an Al-O-Si chemical bond at the interface. The silane film can enhance the Al/CFRP interface's tightness and reduce interfacial defects. The FSLW process affected the joint morphology and mechanical properties through interfacial temperature and stress, which were decided by welding parameters and thermophysical properties of the resin. By adjusting the thermal-mechanical effect of the Al/CFRP interface, defects can be reduced and the joining force can be improved. According to the analysis of interfacial chemical bonds and mechanical properties, the introduction of silane film enhances the hydrogen bond between Al and resin and thus enhances the mechanical properties of the interface. This study provides a new method for revealing the strengthening mechanism of silane-pretreated FSLW Al/CFRP joint.

AB Stem cell therapy has revolutionized the management of osteoarthritis (OA), but the articular dysregulated redox status diminishes cell engraftment efficiency and disrupts immune homeostasis, therefore compromising the overall therapeutic efficacy. Here, we present hydrogen (H2) generators-backpacked mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) which preserve the biological functions and survival of transplanted cells and reverse articular immune dysfunction, mitigating OA. Specifically, post systemic transplantation, H2 generators-laden MSCs home to OA joints, and upon stimulation in acidic OA environment, H2 produced from the generators remodels articular redox balance, thereby relieving the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, decreasing cell apoptosis rate, and maintaining pluripotent and paracrine functions of MSCs. Furthermore, the reactive oxygen species scavenging by H2 in combination with paracrine effects of the MSCs promote macrophage polarization towards the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, which contributes to reversing synovial immune disorder. In severe OA model, the backpacked MSCs reduce osteoarthritic degeneration, osteophyte formation and joint inflammation, and promote cartilage regeneration. In sum, our work demonstrates that arming with H2 generators effectively boosts the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs, which hold great potential for alleviating redox imbalance-related tissue lesions, including but not limited to OA.

AB The effect of travel speed on stress corrosion cracking (SCC) behavior of friction stir welded 2024-T4 aluminum alloy was investigated by slow strain rate tensile test. Microstructure and microhardness of the welded joint were studied. The results showed that the size of second phase particles increased with increasing travel speed, and the distribution of second phase particles was much more homogeneous at lower travel speed. The minimum microhardness was located at the boundary of nugget zone and thermomechanically affected zone. In addition, the SCC susceptibility of the friction stir welded joint increased with the increase of travel speed, owing to the size and distribution of second phase particles in the welds. The anodic applied potentials of -700, -650, -600 mV, and cathodic applied potential of -1200 mV facilitated SCC while the cathodic applied potential of -1000 mV improved the SCC resistance. The SCC behavior was mainly controlled by the metal anodic dissolution at the open circuit potential, and hydrogen accelerated metal embrittlement.

AB Laser metal deposition process was introduced to join AlSi10Mg alloys fabricated by powder bed fusion-laser beam/metal to improve the tensile strength of laser welded joints. The size and the porosity of the hydrogen pores in the weld seam are significantly reduced by laser metal deposition welding. The ultimate tensile strength of the welded joint by using laser metal deposition reaches 318.8 MPa, and the microhardness of the weld seam ranges from 99.5 to 105.4 HV. Compared with single-pass welding, the ultimate tensile strength and hardness are increased by 60.6% and 27.6%. This is mainly attributed to the reduced porosity, refined & alpha;-Al structures and increased connectivity of the Si-rich networks of the weld seam achieved by laser metal deposition welding.

AB In 5000 series (Al-Mg) alloys, hydrogen embrittlement (HE) becomes a concern when Mg content exceeds 5%. The local Mg content will become higher than 5% due to solidification segregation in the weld joint of 5083 alloy. In this study, resistance to HE of MIG-welded 5083 aluminum alloy at three areas (weld center, weld corner and HAZ) was investigated by newly developed humid gas stress corrosion cracking (HG-SCC) test. Slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) test on base metal and welded joint was also conducted for comparison.
   It was newly revealed that HG-SCC crack extends only in the sample of weld corner, confirming HE in this area. For the other areas, HG-SCC crack did not propagate, confirming HE resistance of these areas. From the results of SSRT test, neither the base nor welding material showed reduction in strength or ductility. Therefore, it was concluded that HE in 5083 MIG welds is only detectable by HG-SCC test. The reason for this should be in the fact that HG-SCC test can specifically test different local areas, while the softest area (weld center) always deforms preferentially and fractures in SSRT test.

AB Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate surface changes on dental implant systems and ions release after immersion in fluoride and hydrogen peroxide. Methods Ten implant-abutment assemblies were embedded in acrylic resin and cross-sectioned along the implant vertical axis. Samples were wet ground and polished. Delimited areas of groups of samples were immersed in 1.23% sodium fluoride gel (F) or in 35% hydrogen peroxide (HP) for 16 min. Gels (n = 3) were collected from the implant surfaces and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), to detect the concentration of metallic ions released from the implant systems. Selected areas of the abutment and implant (n = 15) were analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results SEM images revealed surface topographic changes on implant-abutment joints after immersion in fluoride. Implants showed excessive oxidation within loss of material, while abutment surfaces revealed intergranular corrosion after immersion in fluoride. ICP-MS results revealed a high concentration of Ti, Al, V ions in fluoride after contact with the implant systems. Localized corrosion of implant systems could not be detected by SEM after immersion in hydrogen peroxide although the profilometry showed increase in roughness. ICP-MS showed the release of metallic ions in hydrogen peroxide medium after contact with dental implants. Conclusion Therapeutical substances such as fluorides and hydrogen peroxide can promote the degradation of titanium-based dental implant and abutments leading to the release of toxic ions.

AB Hydrogen-assisted cracking is a critical combination of local microstructure, mechanical load and hydrogen concentration. Welded microstructures of low-alloyed creep-resistant Cr-Mo-V steels show different hydrogen trapping kinetics. This influences the adsorbed hydrogen concentration as well as the diffusion by moderate or strong trapping. A common approach to describe hydrogen traps is by their activation energy that is necessary to release hydrogen from the trap. In the present study, Cr-Mo-V steel T24 (7CrMoVTiB10-10) base material and TIG weld metal were investigated. Electrochemically hydrogen charged specimens were analyzed by thermal desorption analysis (TDA) with different linear heating rates. The results show two different effects. At first, the microstructure effect on trapping is evident in terms of higher hydrogen concentrations in the weld metal and increased activation energy for hydrogen release. Secondly, it is necessary to monitor the real specimen temperature. A comparison between the adjusted heating rate and the real specimen temperature shows that the calculated activation energy varies by factor two. Thus, the trap character in case of the base material changes to irreversible at decreased temperature. Hence, the effect of the experimental procedure must be considered as well if evaluating TDA results. Finally, realistic temperature assessment is mandatory for calculation of activation energy via TDA.

AB This paper investigates the effects of substituents in PNP-type ruthenium complexes in the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to formate using the DFT method. Six groups were considered as substituents linked to the P atom of the PNP ligand: hydrogen, methyl, iso-propyl, tert-butyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl. The substituent effects were analyzed from the perspectives of steric hindrance and promotion of hydrogen bonding. With the joint functions of steric hindrance and hydrogen bonding promotion during the CO2 coordination step, hydride addition step, and HCOO- rotation step, these groups exhibited very different substituent effects. The results showed that the methyl group was the most favorable substituent when the solvent's effects were not included, as it formed hydrogen bonding with relatively weak steric hindrance. The second favorable substituent was the iso-propyl group, while the tert-butyl group was the most unfavorable one, due to remarkable steric hindrance. When the substituent was cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl, the complex provided a wider open space for the reaction compared with the tert-butyl-substituted complex, because cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl are cyclic groups. Therefore, the principle for choosing the substituent in PNP-type complexes allowing the design of highly efficient catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation indicates that more hydrogen atoms but wider open space are ideal. In addition, the substituent's effects can be markedly impacted by the solvent used.

AB Bipolar plates are regarded as the core of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell. In order to obtain a connected stainless steel bipolar plate with low residual stress and small deformation, the brazing process is commonly used for bipolar plate connection. In this study, a numerical model was developed to calculate the residual stress in a brazed joint. Clamp pressure, brazing gap, and solder type were investigated. The results showed that clamping pressure had little influence on residual stress and the residual stress decreased with an increase in the brazing gap, which provided a reference for controlling brazed residual stresses for stainless steel bipolar plates.

AB This paper addresses the challenge of renewable energy curtailment, which stems from the inherent uncertainty and volatility of wind and photovoltaic (PV) generation, by developing a robust model predictive control (RMPC)-based scheduling strategy for an integrated wind-PV-hydrogen storage multi-energy flow system. By building a "wind-PV-hydrogen storage-fuel cell" collaborative system, the time and space complementarity of wind and PV is used to stabilize fluctuations, and the electrolyzer-hydrogen production-gas storage tank-fuel cell chain is used to absorb surplus power. A multi-time scale state-space model (SSM) including power balance equation, equipment constraints, and opportunity constraints is established. The RMPC scheduling framework is designed, taking the wind-PV joint probability scene generated by Copula and improved K-means and SSM state variables as inputs, and the improved genetic algorithm is used to solve the min-max robust optimization problem to achieve closed-loop control. Validation using real-world data from Xinjiang demonstrates a 57.83% reduction in grid power fluctuations under extreme conditions and a 58.41% decrease in renewable curtailment rates, markedly enhancing the local system's capacity to utilize wind and solar energy.

AB Electrodes with porous structures are widely used in commercial alkaline water splitting devices. By optimizing the porous structure, the efficiency of alkaline water splitting devices could be evidently promoted. In this work, nickel electrodes with gradient porosity distribution were designed and fabricated through selective laser melting. The effect of gradient porous distribution structure on electrochemical performance of Ni electrode was evaluated. The results showed that with small pores towards counter electrode the prepared Ni electrodes exhibits better anodic performance, and a better cathodic performance is observed with big pores towards the counter electrode. It was considered as joint effect of active specific area and mass transfer. Finally, by applying an electrolysis cell with optimized arrangement, an improvement of 14% electrolysis efficiency is achieved, which shows the potential of Ni electrodes with gradient porosity distribution to be applied in commercial application of hydrogen generation.

AB With the development of energy integration technology, demand response (DR) has gradually evolved into integrated demand response (IDR). In this study, for the integrated energy system (IES) on the distribution grid side with electricity, heat, natural gas network, and hydrogen energy equipment, the analogy relationship between the thermal and mobile hydrogen energy storage networks is proposed. Moreover, a unified model that reflects network commonalities across different energy forms is established. Then, considering the time delay of the IES in the nontransient network, a time-domain two-port model of the IES considering the time delay is established. This model shows the joint effect of time and space on system parameters. Finally, this study validates the model in the application of DR. The verification results show that in DR, the time-domain two-port model can accurately "cut peaks and fill valleys" for the IES and effectively reduce the operating cost of the IES system.

AB High temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) with inherent safe characteristics has a potential to contribute to decarbonization of hard-to-abate industries by supplying a large amount of hydrogen and high temperature heat or steam without carbon dioxide emission. Promotion of R&D on HTGR and hydrogen production technology is stated in Japanese policies, e,g, The Sixth Strategic Energy Plan and Basic Policy for Realization of Green Transformation (GX). Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) has been conducting R&Ds for HTGR technologies with a central focus on the use of High Temperature Engineering Test Reactor (HTTR). Based on the knowledge accumulated from the various HTTR's tests conducted so far, JAEA obtained the permission of changes to reactor installation in June 2020 and loss of forced cooing (LOFC) test which simulates the situation where the reactor cannot be cooled and shutdown as a joint the OECD/NEA international research project was carried out in January 2022. JAEA has launched the HTTR heat application test plan which demonstrate hydrogen production by coupling the HTTR with a hydrogen production test facility. The demonstration of hydrogen production is expected to be completed by 2030. Aiming for operation start from the latter half of 2030s, the basic design of the HTGR demonstration reactor is started from 2023. The Japan's HTGR technology capabilities established by the HTTR project will be fully utilized for the construction of HTGR demonstration reactor.

AB Methanol, as a liquid organic hydrogen carrier, exhibits advantageous features such as easy storage, transportability, and low energy consumption at ambient conditions, making it a reliable on-site emergency hydrogen source. The adoption of steam reforming allows for the efficient release of hydrogen from liquid organic hydrogen carriers, thus offering a promising solution to hydrogen storage and transport challenges. Moreover, leveraging renewable energy sources (solar energy) to replace conventional fossil fuels for powering methanol steam reforming (MSR) reactions enables the utilization of high-quality on-demand hydrogen sources with reduced carbon emissions. However, several challenges in solar-driven MSR research persist, encompassing catalyst lifespan, reaction rate, reaction stability, and environmental impact. This review comprehensively summarizes and discusses recent advancements in solar-driven MSR, focusing on solar reactor design, development of control strategies for reaction systems, investigation of energy storage systems for reactors, as well as analysis of the photothermal coupling reaction mechanism. The primary aim is to share the latest progress in solar-driven MSR and identify common challenges and future research directions. Specifically, this paper focuses on the development of a joint active/passive control system, the establishment of a complementary energy supply system with multiple drive modes, the development of a low-temperature and high-efficiency conversion technology for the reactants, and the exploration of a synergistic gain mechanism for the coupling of photothermal energy in MSR reactions. Furthermore, it advocates for interdisciplinary design approaches to achieve seamless integration between solar energy supply systems and MSR reaction systems, thereby minimizing energy losses during the reaction process. The insights provided in this review offer novel perspectives and directions for the development of low-carbon hydrogen production processes.

AB The various mechanisms of primary antioxidant action of a series of 2-Methoxyphenols are investigated in the present work. The electronic properties have just been studied in a joint article, so that we focus here on Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT), Single Electron Transfer-Proton Transfer (SET-PT) and Sequential Proton-Loss Electron-Transfer (SPLET) mechanisms. The two computational approaches used in the previous study of the structure and reactivity of these compounds [Computational and Theoretical Chemistry 1229 (2023) 114287] provide identical mechanisms trends in gas phase. In gas media, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) is more favored. On the contrary, the solvent polarity has a significant effect on the mechanism of the antioxidant activity, since the polarity of the solvent increases the contribution of the SPLET mechanism.

ID PRESSURE
AB Hydrogen is expected to play a major role in the decarbonization of the energy grid. As a fuel, it possesses an elevated energy density per unit mass, about twice as much as natural gas but also a very low mass density; for this reason, it is preferably stored and transported at elevated pressures in the gas phase to achieve a comparable volumetric energy density. High strength quenched and tempered ferritic steels are widely used for gaseous hydrogen storage despite the fact that hydrogen affects material properties and result in higher fatigue crack growth rate and lower fracture toughness. This work presents the results of a comprehensive fracture toughness test program in gaseous hydrogen for the characterization of base metal, heat affected zone and weld metal on a high strength, quenched and tempered steel, suitable for the construction of hydrogen pressure equipment. Full penetration, butt welded joints were made using partly mechanized gas metal arc welding technique on a weldable, high strength steel, namely EN 101216-3 grade P690 QL2. Two different welding procedures were evaluated, and fracture toughness tests were conducted according to ASTM E1820 requirements, in high purity (99.9995%) hydrogen gas at a pressure of 200 bar on specimens extracted from base metal, heat affected zone and weld metal. While base metal and weld metal exhibited stable crack growth behavior, heat affected zone showed variable behavior as a function of the post-weld heat treatment conditions. It was found that local microhardness spots are a concern and should be controlled through dedicated post weld heat treatment operation to limit hardness values for use of welds in H2 gas conditions.

AB With the advantages of non-pollution and energy-saving, hydrogen fuel cell hybrid vehicles (HFCHVs) are regarded as one of the potential traveling ways in the future. The energy management of FCHVs has a huge energy-efficient potential which is combined with the Internet of Things (IOT) and auto-driving technologies. In this paper, a hierarchical joint optimization method that combines deep deterministic policy gradient and dynamic planning (DDPG-DP) for speed planning and energy management of the HFCHV is proposed for urban road driving scenarios. The results demonstrate that when the HFCHV is operating in driving scenario 1, the traveling efficiency of the DDPG-DP algorithm is 17.8% higher than that of the IDM-DP algorithm, and the hydrogen fuel consumption is reduced by 2.7%. In contrast, the difference in the traveling efficiency and fuel economy is small among the three algorithms in driving scenario 2, the number of idling/stop situations of the DDPG-DP algorithm is reduced compared with that of the IDM-DP algorithm. This will support further research for multi-objective eco-driving optimization of fuel cell hybrid vehicles.

ID GRAIN-SIZE; STAINLESS-STEELS; EMBRITTLEMENT; BOUNDARY; ENERGY
AB This study investigates the microstructure and hardness of weld metals used in liquid hydrogen storage tanks, with a focus on the effects of three welding methods: Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW), Submerged Arc Welding (SAW), and Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW). Finite element simulations were employed to model the temperature field during welding, aiding in the explanation of observed microstructural differences. The results show that while GTAW and SMAW produce weld metals with similar microstructures, SAW generates significantly larger grains with a pronounced preferential orientation. The use of weaving techniques play a key role in shaping the solidification microstructures. Additionally, the hardness of the weld metal is comparable to that of the base material, with a slight reduction corresponding to increased grain size. This research offers valuable insights into optimizing welding processes for liquid hydrogen storage tanks by addressing the microstructural characteristics that influence weld joint performance.

AB A review of the microstructural evolution and phase transformation in the hydrogenated weld zone of Ti-0.3Mo-0.8Ni alloy argon-arc welded joints has been considered. The role of crystallographic, microstructural, and precipitation mechanisms on the defect-free properties of the hydrogenated weld zone has been analyzed, and hydride phase formations have been revealed by the influence of hydrogen on the microstructural characteristics of the weld zone. The results show face-centered cubic (FCC) and face-centered tetragonal (FCT) hydride phase formations are found in the hydrogenated 0.21wt% H weld zone. Large lamellar, slender plate and long needle hydrides can only precipitate from the alpha lamellae, and not from the transformed beta phase due to the high hydrogen solubility found in the beta phase. Formation of the and hydrides are the result of (H) phase separation reaction: (H) (H lean region)+ (H rich region) and (H) (H rich region), respectively. The precipitation mechanisms and characteristics of the and hydrides formed in alpha phase are discussed in detail. Dislocation multiplication around the hydrides is promoted effectively by hydrogen addition, the fact that the quantity of dislocations around the hydride increased obviously compared to hydride indicated the (H) phase transformation result in a greater volume expansion rate.

AB This paper presents the corrosion test results of 9% Ni steels (ASTM A522 type 1 and ASTM A333 grade 8) in presence of aqueous solutions containing H2S and CO2. A forged bar and a seamless pipe, manufactured to be used in high-pressure CO2 lines, were tested by NACE TM0177, TM0284, and ISO 7539-2. Localized corrosion and cracks were observed in the sulfide stress cracking (SSC) tests, in both base materials, and welded joint. These types of attack were associated to specific metallurgical features of the products (forged bar and seamless pipe), indicating that a better evaluation of the corrosion resistance of these materials is necessary. No hydrogen induced cracking damage was detected after the standard testing time, but microcracks were identified, reducing the impact energy levels. The welded joint presented high susceptibility to SSC cracking.

AB The photochemistry of the ethyl radical following excitation to the 3p Rydberg state is investigated in a joint experimental and theoretical study. Velocity map images for hydrogen atoms detected from photoexcited isotopologues CH3CH2, CH3CD2 and CD3CH2 at similar to 201 nm, are discussed along with high-level ab initio electronic structure calculations of potential energy curves and non-adiabatic coupling matrix elements (NACME). A novel mechanism governed by a conical intersection allowing prompt site-specific hydrogen-atom elimination is presented and discussed. For this mechanism to occur, an initial ro-vibrational excitation is allocated to the radical permitting to access this reaction pathway and thus to control the ethyl photochemistry. While hydrogen-atom elimination from cold ethyl radicals occurs through internal conversion into lower electronic states followed by slow statistical dissociation, prompt site-specific C-alpha elimination into CH3CH + H, occurring through a fast non-adiabatic crossing to a valence bound state followed by dissociation through a conical intersection, is accessed by means of an initial ro-vibrational energy content into the radical. The role of a particularly effective vibrational promoting mode in this prompt photochemical reaction pathway is discussed.

AB Pd-alloy membrane tubes are used for hydrogen isotopes separation in the fusion fuel cycle. The efficiency of these separation processes has been significantly increased by the adoption of thin-walled self-supported membrane tubes that exhibit high permeance and infinite selectivity to hydrogen. A critical aspect in the realization of Pd-based membrane devices (both separators and membrane reactors) is related to the joining of the thin-walled tubes to the membrane module. In this work, an innovative fitting of thin-walled tubes has been obtained by coupling two special stainless steel joints (a weld adapter and a sealing insert) that tighten the flared edge of the tube. In particular, the design of the compression fitting relies on the elastic deformation reserve of the conical edge of the sealing insert that is capable: i) to ensure the sealing of the joining also in presence of the expansion/contraction of the Pd-Ag alloy during the hydrogenation cycling, and ii) to compensate small irregularities of the thin-walled tube (thickness, circularity, etc.). The effectiveness of the new joining technique in terms of both hydrogen perm-selectivity and stability has been verified in preliminary permeations tests.

AB Hydrogen-based power generation could increase the sustainability and efficiency of future energy systems due to the higher storing capabilities resulting from the higher gravimetric density of hydrogen energy. This work proposes a hydrogen-based multi-carrier energy system (HMES) comprising renewable energy resource (RES), electricity, and hydrogen markets as input energy carriers and power, cooling, and heating as demands. Thermal water storage and hydrogen tank storage are considered to improve energy efficiency. This system uses the full capacity of intermittent wind and solar energy to increase RES utilization and decrease carbon emissions simultaneously. The environmental and economic goals of the proposed HMES are satisfied through the weighted-sum multi-objective method. The trade-off solution between operation and emission costs is ultimately obtained through the max-min fuzzy method. Chance constraint programming (CCP), which offers decisionmakers a variety of risk-taker strategies, is utilized as a tool to manage the risk associated with stochastic optimization. The confidence level of the CCP determines the risk tolerated by the decision-maker, improving the optimization process by creating a more realistic approach to risk management in real-world models. The results show the benefits of hydrogen tank by reducing operation costs by 4.5% and importance of CCP leading to operation costs reduction.

SO ORGANIC & BIOMOLECULAR CHEMISTRY

DT Article
ID NRF2
AB As a chronic inflammatory disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can cause progressive damage to joints and various organs. Hydrogen peroxide plays a significant role in the pathogenesis and progression of RA and thus serves as a biomarker for diagnosing this disease. Although fluorescent probes have emerged as promising tools for detecting H2O2, most available ones suffer from the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect, short-wavelength emission, low sensitivity, and poor water solubility. Herein, a new type of "turn-on" AIE probe based on excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) was developed, with phenylboronic acid pinacol ester-appended quinolinium as the H2O2 recognition site, which is in the quenched state due to the twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) effect. The probe HTQ-R exhibits good water solubility, high sensitivity, a low detection limit (210 nM), rapid response ability, and good biocompatibility towards hydrogen peroxide, and has shown the ability to accurately target mitochondria. Furthermore, HTQ-R was successfully used to detect exogenous and endogenous hydrogen peroxide in living cells, which enabled real-time monitoring of H2O2 in RA mice, demonstrating its potential significance in the diagnosis and treatment of RA.

AB Tungsten heavy alloys (THA) are used in the defense industry for subcaliber bullet cores due to their high density and strength. Typically methods of joining tungsten rod elements include: soldering, friction welding or threaded sleeve splicing. The properties of the joints were tested for three types of material containing 90.8, 96.2 and 98.2 wt.%. tungsten, density from 17.3 to 18.4 g/cm(3) and strength range 400-1000 MPa. Combination in the liquid phase at the sintering temperature was carried out in a vacuum furnace at a temperature of 1520 degrees C in a hydrogen atmosphere, and tests used pairs of both identical and dissimilar materials. After that, some of the bars were subjected to additional heat treatment at 1100 degrees C for 3 h. The tests of the mechanical properties in the static tensile test and the measurement of impact strength showed that the obtained strength of the joints was comparable to that of the parent material. The microstructure analysis showed that the resulting joint area, while maintaining the appropriate roughness of the joined end faces of the bars, is homogeneous without areas of the solidified matrix of the joint line. Research showed that it is possible to bond under sintering conditions with the participation of a solid liquid phase of homonymous and dissimilar THA materials. The strength of joints in dissimilar materials was comparable to a tungsten heavy alloy material with lower strength in the bonded pair while homonymous materials were comparable to the original material. The test results provided a good basis for further research in which the obtained pairs of joints will be subjected to plastic working processes.

AB Common crustal igneous and high grade metamorphic rocks contain peroxy defects which remain dormant until the rock experiences stress upon deformation. Stress activated peroxy defects form highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the rock-water interface observed in both terrestrial and extraterrestrial rock samples. The ROS complex is formed upon rock fluid interaction when groundwater combines with the ROS to produce hydrogen peroxide giving an indirect measure of the underlying rock stress and crustal deformation along active faults. The average concentration of hydrogen peroxide from the Sohna thermal spring water falling along the active Sohna fault and geothermal field was measured to be similar to 0.53 +/- 0.014 mg/l. Similar average concentration was also recorded from borewell sample north of the spring (similar to 0.56 +/- 0.017 mg/l) within the same geothermal field. Lower concentration of hydrogen peroxide was recorded within samples collected from hard rock aquifers outside the geothermal field and the active fault zone (similar to 0.138 +/- 0.095 mg/l). The detailed analysis suggests that the presence of hydrogen peroxide is largely dependent on the circulation pattern through the interconnected fractures/joints within the quartzite bedrock lying adjacent to the fault plane. Laboratory analysis results also show high hydrogen peroxide concentration within two borewell samples falling adjacent to the epicentre of a shallow microtremor event within the hard rock region falling alongside a lineament along the Delhi hard rock mega fold. Rock water interaction post stress activation of peroxy defects and formation of ROS has therefore been inferred to be responsible for the formation of hydrogen peroxide at the rock water interface within these zones. This pilot study provides scientific field evidence that hydrogen peroxide concentrations within groundwaters might offer prospects for seismic stress estimation and crustal deformation along seismically active zones.

AB Hydrogen production from renewable electrolysis is a suitable transformative technology for driving a cleaner energy mix, mitigating climate change, and achieving sustainable development and has been given the color value definition of "green hydrogen". However, this low-carbon technology is still in its infancy, and the pathways for expanding market supply have not been analyzed. To address the problems of unclear factors influencing the diffusion of green hydrogen technology innovation, unclear technology diffusion laws, and inaccurate predictions of regional green hydrogen production capacity under the goal of decarbonization policy, this work constructs a spatial assessment framework of the feasibility of low-carbon technology development in response to climate change on the basis of the theory of technological innovation systems, the improved technology diffusion model, and the feasibility of climate change spatial concepts to analyze and predict the diffusion law and regional green hydrogen production capacity of hydrogen production by renewable energy under the goal of carbon neutrality. The results of the study on the development of renewable hydrogen technology in China show that it follows the law of diffusion of low-carbon technologies in both the formation and growth stages. The diffusion of green hydrogen technology in the formation stage is slow, and the regional green hydrogen capacity in the near term cannot meet the decarbonization policy target demand in 2030. Before the spatial inflection point of technology diffusion feasibility, the demand-pull of the phase decarbonization policy target dominated the stability and sustainability of the green hydrogen supply market. After the inflection point, the internal growth of technology diffusion plays a key role in market diffusion and ultimately reaches a saturation value under the joint regulation of policy and the market to realize a carbon-neutral target capacity demand in 2060. The uncertainty of diffusion model parameters leads to anomalies in the feasibility space of technology diffusion, and risks such as overcapacity or insufficient demand in some regions may occur. Overall, this work provides a systematic assessment system for analyzing and predicting the pathways and characteristics of expanding renewable hydrogen production in specific regions under decarbonization policy objectives.

AB Background: Because hydrogen therapy has been found beneficial for the treatment of inflammation, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and oxidative stress in humans, it seems useful to evaluate the effects of exogenously administered hydrogen as an element in the immediate management of sports-related soft tissue injuries. The main aim of this pilot study was to examine the effects of 2-week administration of hydrogen on the biochemical markers of inflammation and functional recovery in male professional athletes after acute soft tissue injury. Method: During the 2013 season (from March to May), 36 professional athletes were recruited as participants and examined by a certified sports medicine specialist in the first 24 hours after an injury was sustained. Subjects were allocated to 3 randomly assigned trials in a single-blind design. Those in the control group received a traditional treatment protocol for soft tissue injury. Subjects in the first experimental group followed the same procedures as the control group but with additional administration throughout the study of oral hydrogen-rich tablets (2 g per day). Subjects in the second experimental group also followed the procedures of the control group, with additional administration throughout the study of both oral hydrogen-rich tablets (2 g per day) and topical hydrogen-rich packs (6 times per day for 20 minutes). Participants were evaluated at the time of the injury report and at 7 and 14 days after baseline testing. Results: Oral and topical hydrogen intervention was found to augment plasma viscosity decrease as compared with the control group (P = 0.04). Differences were found for range-of-motion recovery between the 3 groups; oral and topical hydrogen intervention resulted in a faster return to normal joint range of motion for both flexion and extension of the injured limb as compared with the control intervention (P < 0.05). Conclusion: These preliminary results support the hypothesis that the addition of hydrogen to traditional treatment protocols is potentially effective in the treatment of soft tissue injuries in male professional athletes.

AB The welding of ultra-high hard armour (UHA) steel is highly challenging due to their higher hardness (600 HV) and higher carbon equivalent (0.80). In this investigation, 15-mm-thick UHA steel plates are welded by shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) process using three different consumables such as austenitic stainless steel (ASS), low-hydrogen ferritic steel (LHF), and duplex stainless steel (DSS). The joints were tested against a 7.62 x 54 mm Armor-piercing (AP) projectile. All three joints successfully stopped the projectile at weld metal and interface (weld/HAZ) without perforation. The ballistic performance and mechanical properties are improved than the currently used ASS electrodes, and a new method to study the mode of failure at weld metal and interface was introduced. Striations and microcracks are preferred modes of failure than wear debris in the weld metal, and soft/hard mode is preferred over soft/soft and hard/hard modes of failure at the interface.

AB Compared to other structural alloys, magnesium alloys have a relatively poor corrosion resistance and low mechanical strength, which can be further deteriorated when these alloys are subjected to joining processes using the existing joining methods. Herein, we propose for the first time an additive friction stir-welding (AFSW) using fine Al powder as an additive to improve the mechanical strength as well as corrosion resistance of AZ31B weld joints. AFSW is a solid-state welding method of forming a high-Al AZ31B joint via an in-situ reaction between pure Al powders filled in a machined groove and the AZ31B matrix. To optimize the process parameters, AFSW was performed under different rotational and transverse speeds, and number of passes, using tools with a square or screw pin. In particular, to fabricate a weld zone, where the Al was homogenously dispersed, the effects of the groove shape were investigated using three types of grooves: surface one-line groove, surface-symmetric grooves, and inserted symmetric grooves. The homogenous and defect-less AFS-welded AZ31B joint was successfully fabricated with the following optimal parameters: 1400 rpm, 25 mm/min, four passes, inserted symmetric grooves, and the tool with a square pin. The AFSW fully dissolved the additive Al into & alpha;-Mg and in-situ precipitated Mg 17 Al 12 particles, which was confirmed via scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscope, and X-ray diffraction analyses. The microhardness, joint efficiency, and elongation at the fracture point of the AFS-welded AZ31B joint were 80 HV, 101%, and 8.9%, respectively. These values are higher than those obtained for the FS-welded AZ31 joint in previous studies. The corrosion resistance of the AFS-welded AZ31B joint, evaluated via hydrogen evolution measurements and potentiodynamic polarization tests, was enhanced to 55% relative to the FS-welded AZ31B joint.& COPY; 2022 Chongqing University.

AB This paper focuses on an experimental study of the explosive decompression on representative samples of the hyperbaric type IV hydrogen storage vessels. The adhesion of the composite to the liner is achieved by different adhesives. The bond behavior of liner-to composite bonded joint considerably depends on the properties of adhesives, as well as the assembly process. X-ray tomography allows determining the damages before and after explosive decompression tests. Tomographic observations have revealed a certain level of porosity due to the assembly process with plasma treatment. This porosity influences the damage mechanisms induced by explosive decompression. Results show that 1) the increasing of the maximum hydrogen pressure (differential pressure induced during the depressurization step between the liner/adhesive interface or the adhesive/composite) increases the risk of liner collapse for the same gas exposure conditions, 2) Compared with soft adhesive, the stiff adhesive has proven better adhesion between the composite and the liner, 3) the flame treatment improved the surface energy of the PA6 and subsequently increased the collapse limit pressure, 4) adhesive RCA-20 with plasma preparation can be defined as a kind of low strength to collapse adhesive with a collapse limit pressure less than 2 MPa, 5)adhesive RCA-2000 with flame treatment can be defined as a kind of high strength to collapse adhesive in the present report with a collapse limit pressure between 15 MPa and 17.5 MPa.

AB The weak intermolecular forces of hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) make it relatively difficult to synthesize and design HOFs with superprotonic conductivity and robustness. The self-assembly of ionic hydrogen bonding organic frameworks (iHOFs) through acid-base pairing strategies are possible on account of the rich hydrogen bonding, strong ionic bonding, and pi-pi stacking interactions and so on. Herein, a case of iHOF (<bold>iHOF-16</bold>) with a three-dimensional (3D) hydrogen bonding network is reported, the doughty ionic bond interactions in the structure and pi-pi stacking interactions between layers make it exhibits excellent thermal and chemical stability, it can maintain high crystallinity and robust structure even under extreme conditions. Importantly, <bold>iHOF-16</bold> exhibits highly anisotropic proton conductivity of 0.388, 5.56 x 10(-3), and 3.25 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) in the direction of a-axis, b-axis, and c-axis, respectively. The proton transfer paths of single crystal on each axis are calculated using density functional theory (DFT) and, supported by joint experimental-theoretical calculations, protons are most easily transported in the a-axis direction resulting in superprotonic conductivity. The present study provides a promising approach for the design of stable superprotonic conductivity materials through a simple yet effective charge-assisted synthesis strategy.

AB The new hydrogen-containing integrated energy system proposed in this paper has complementary coupling of multiple energy forms such as electricity, gas, cold, heat, and hydrogen. For the same type of load demand, equipment with different energy input forms can be dispatched for joint supply. However, different equipment differ in dynamic response speed and energy utilization efficiency, and the reasonable configuration of equipment capacity will directly affect the overall dynamic characteristics and energy efficiency level of the system. Therefore, this paper first proposes an evaluation index that can comprehensively characterize the dynamic energy efficiency and load tracking ability of energy equipment. In addition, a preference adjustable capacity configuration optimization method based on utopian point tracking is proposed with the two optimization objectives of this indicator and the system's equivalent annualized investment cost, and the solution complexity is reduced through segmented linearization of the objective. Simulations presented here show that the capacity configuration optimization method proposed in this paper has a positive effect on improving the dynamic energy efficiency and load tracking ability of the new hydrogen-containing integrated energy system, and can also meet the preference setting needs of different investment entities for capacity configuration optimization goals.

AB Doping regulation holds promise to modulate electrocatalytic performance, yet it remains largely unexplored for ferroelectric (FE) BaTiO3 (BTO). By jointly employing first-principles calculations and machine learning (ML) analysis, we examine the effect of a broad range of transition metal (TM) doping in FE BTO on the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and screen out the optimal TM dopants. We unveil that some early-to-middle group TM (V, Cr, Mo, Ta, Ru)-doped BTO surfaces feature higher synthesizability, which also exhibit noticeable HER activity with |Delta G(H*)| < 0.2 eV owing to intermediate hydrogen adsorption strength. Among all doped surfaces, the Mo-doped one shows optimal HER activity under both out-of-plane and in-plane polarization states. We reveal an intense interplay between the hydrogen adsorption configuration and the corresponding hydrogen bonding interaction, which relies more on the TM group than the polarization state. Most importantly, we propose a physically informed descriptor of the surface oxygen p band, which better describes HER activity trends of TM-doped surfaces than conventional band descriptors.This indicates the significance of the fractional filling and bandwidth of occupied oxygen p-band states. Moreover, we establish a robust ML model that can well predict HER activity with surface-independent input parameters alone with R-2 value above 0.93. From these parameters, we identify the inherent outer electron number of the TM dopant as the dominant feature, while the second ionization energy of the TM dopant and the initial polarization state show non-negligible feature importance. These findings could enlighten understanding, rational design, and accelerated discovery of element doping of FE materials for catalysis and other implications.

AB In this paper, we report a joint experimental and computational study to elaborate the mechanism for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Experimental results indicate that the catalyst (sodium magnesium chlorophyll, MgChlNa(2)), which has a well-defined structure for calculation and understanding, can achieve the photoreduction of CO2 to CO only using water as a dispersant, without adding any photosensitizer or sacrificial agent. Subsequently, a series of structural models of the hydrogen-bonded complexes of the catalyst were constructed and outlined via utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, including photophysical and photochemical processes. The results confirm that the rate-limiting step of the whole CO2RR was the intersystem crossing process. The electron and proton transfers involved in photophysical and photochemical processes are induced by hydrogen bonds in the excited states. The combination of experiments and calculations will provide an important reference for the design of high-efficiency photocatalysts in the photocatalytic CO2RR.

AB Methodological improvements in both single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) mean that the two methods are being more frequently used together to tackle complex problems in structural biology. There are many benefits to this combination, including for the analysis of low-resolution density, for structural validation, in the analysis of individual proteins versus the same proteins in large complexes, studies of allostery, protein quality control during cryo-EM construct optimization, and in the study of protein movements/dynamics during function. As will be highlighted in this review, through careful considerations of potential sample and conformational heterogeneity, many joint studies have recently been demonstrated, and many future studies using this combination are anticipated.

AB Titanium alloys have high specific strength and excellent corrosion resistance and have been applied in deep-sea engineering fields. However, stress corrosion cracking may become one of the biggest threats to the service safety of a high-strength titanium alloy, as well as its weldment. In this work, stress corrosion cracking of a gas-tungsten-arc-welded Ti-6Al-3Nb-2Zr-1Mo (Ti6321) alloy influenced by the applied potentials in simulated deep-sea and shallow-sea environments was investigated by combining slow strain rate testing with electrochemical measurements. The results showed that the service environment and applied potential have a substantial effect on the stress corrosion cracking behavior of the Ti6321 welded joint. The Ti6321 welded joint exhibited higher stress corrosion susceptibility in a simulated deep-sea environment and at a strong polarization level owing to the diminishing protection of the passive film under passivation inhibition and the enhancement of the hydrogen effect. The fracture of a Ti6321 welded joint in the weld material could be attributed to the softening effect of the thick secondary alpha within the coarse-grained martensite. The electrochemical evaluation model of stress corrosion cracking susceptibility of a Ti6321 welded joint in a simulated marine environment was established by adding the criterion in the passivation region based on the literature model, and four potential regions corresponding to different stress corrosion cracking mechanisms were classified and discussed. Our study provides useful guidance for the deep-sea engineering applications of Ti6321 alloys and a rapid assessment method of stress corrosion risk.

AB This study investigated the resistance effect of Sodium-Silicate solution coated on the welding zone surface on stress corrosion cracking, which was caused by the penetration of storage hydrogen into micro cracks. This phenomenon occasionally occurred while welding the joint with gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) between the bottle cover and body fabricated using aluminum alloy 7075 (Al-Zn-Mg). The coating effect of Sodium-Silicate was evaluated using four factors, namely, hardening agent, solidification method, coating thickness, and baking temperature. Taguchi analysis was applied to determine the optimal parameters, which were then used to effectively improve the corrosion resistance of the welding zone. The corrosion resistance of the group added with magnesium oxide as a hardening agent increased to 200% compared with the group added with Sodium-Silicate but without hardening agent. The penetration depth of the tested group added with talc as a hardening agent also increased to 20%. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB 1H-pyrrolo[3,2-h]qinoline (PQ) and 2-(2 '-pyridyl)pyrrole (PP) are important systems in the study of proton-transfer reactions. These molecules possess hydrogen bond donor (pyrrole) and acceptor (pyridine) groups, which leads to the formation of cyclic dimers in their crystals. Herein, we present a joint experimental (Raman scattering) and computational (DFT modelling) study on the high-pressure behaviour of PQ and PP molecular crystals. Our results indicate that compression up to 10 GPa (100 kbar) leads to considerable strengthening of the intermolecular hydrogen bond within the cyclic dimers. However, the intramolecular N-H center dot center dot center dot N interaction is either weakly affected by pressure, as witnessed in PQ, or weakened due to compression-induced distortions of the molecule, as was found for PP. Therefore, we propose that the compression of these systems should facilitate double proton transfer within the cyclic dimers of PQ and PP, while intramolecular transfer should either remain unaffected (for PQ) or weakened (for PP).

AB The plate-fin heat exchanger (PFHE) is the core equipment used to achieve the high effi-ciency of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), however, the issues of high-performance brazed joints in the manufacturing of the PFHE have been a challenge due to the poor mechanical properties. This study proposes a brazing manufacturing technology of isothermal solidi-fication with the optimized post bonding heat treatment strategy, to synergistically improve the strength-ductility property and homogenize microstructure of brazed joints, aiming at guaranteeing the high energy efficiency of SOFC. The results show that brazing at 1065 degrees C for 25 min achieves the complete isothermal solidification and an intermetallic-free joint centerline with numerous borides generating in the diffusion-affected zone. Solution treatment then dissolves large quantities of acicular and blocky borides. The uniformity of grain size and kernel average misorientation distribution is also improved due to recrys-tallization, which becomes more pronounced after solution aging treatment. In addition, solution aging treatment results in an improvement in the ultimate tensile strength of the brazed joint, which is more prominent than that after solution treatment. However, the increase in elongation after solution aging treatment is smaller than after solution treat-ment, while still much higher than the as-brazed joint due to the dissolution of boride precipitates and growth of twin boundaries. The results demonstrate that the proposed brazing manufacturing technology not only homogenizes microstructure, but also signifi-cantly improves strength and ductility, further promoting the long-life operation of SOFC.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB Welding of AlSi10Mg alloys fabricated by additive manufacturing (AM) has been recently conducted to meet the demands for joining or repairing them. However, high susceptibility to porosity occurring in weld metal (WM) poses a significant challenge for fusion welding of AM AlSi10Mg alloys. The laser metal deposition (LMD) process has emerged as a promising welding solution due to its low dilution rate for reducing the porosity. In this study, LMD welding of AM AlSi10Mg alloys was carried out employing different heat inputs with five and eight tracks. The study systematically assessed the impact of heat input on porosity, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the welded joints. The results show that the decrease of heat input from 180 to 75 J/mm results in a substantial reduction in porosity from 7.0 to 2.1%. This reduction leads to a 29.4% increase in ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and an 11.7% increase in elongation index (EI). Furthermore, the upper region of joints with eight tracks possessing low heat input displays lower porosity and superior mechanical properties than the bottom region with relatively high heat input. The WM with eight tracks exhibits refined alpha-Al cells and Si-rich eutectic phases, improved connectivity of Si-rich networks, and increased solid solution strengthening, compared to the five-track joints with higher heat input. As a result, low heat input of the upper region in the LMD welded joints has been effective in minimizing hydrogen pores, enhancing WM microstructure, and improving the mechanical properties of welded joints in AM AlSi10Mg alloys.

AB Most of weld defects occurring in the welding of martensitic stainless steels are caused by the presence of hydrogen. Thus, the effects of hydrogen in the weld zone need to be well-understood to estimate the quality and service life of martensitic stainless steel joints. In the present study, AISI 420 martensitic stainless steel materials were welded by using different combinations of shielding gas via the gas metal arc welding (GMAW) method. It is known that shielding gases also play a critical role in heat input, cooling rate, microstructure of weld seam, weld defects, and mechanical properties besides drying of molten weld pool. Thus, it is important to investigate the effects of shielding gases and gas combinations on the welding of martensitic stainless steels in the welding process. In the present study, 100 % Ar, 97 % Ar + 3 % H-2 and 93 % Ar + 7 % H-2 gas combinations were employed. The welded sheets were subjected to the metallographic examination as well as hardness, tensile, and bending tests. The effect of the tests and the combination of shielding gas on the mechanical and microstructural properties of AISI 420 stainless steel was investigated. The results indicated that a noticeable grain coarsening occurred in the microstructure of the weld metal and heat affected zones (HAZs) after the addition of H-2 into the Ar gas during the welding process. The highest tensile strength was obtained from the joints with 100 % Ar gas. As a result of the tensile test, rupture occurred in the base metal-HAZ transition zone in all the welded samples. In the joints welded with 97 % Ar + 3 % H-2 and 93 % Ar + 7 % H-2 gas combinations, fracture occurred in the base metal-HAZ transition zone during the bending test.

AB This paper presents an experimental study of turbulent non-premixed jet flames of ethylene/nitrogen where the nitrogen is substituted with different proportions of hydrogen and/or ammonia. The focus is largely on the effects of hydrogen and ammonia on soot production in turbulent flames. A combination of pointwise, laser-induced fluorescence in the visible and UV bands (LIF-UV-visible), and laser-induced incandescence (LII) is used to measure soot precursors and soot along the flame centerline. All signals are collected at a repetition rate of 10 Hz with fast photomultiplier tubes to resolve the time decay. In a separate experiment, joint imaging of LIF-OH-CH is also performed at a repetition rate of 10 kHz. Hydrogen substitution is found to increase the production of soot, whereas ammonia substitution inhibits soot formation. The peak mean soot volume fraction is almost a factor of 3 lower in the 25% ammonia case in comparison to the 25% nitrogen case. The mean signal decay time constant decreases with ammonia substitution, implying the formation of smaller soot nanoparticles. The mean signal decay time constant remains unaffected with hydrogen substitution. Measured peaks in LIF-CH and LIF-OH are reduced with ammonia substitution but only in regions upstream of where soot is formed. Further downstream in the sooting region, neither OH nor CH appear to be affected by the substitution of N-2 with H-2 or NH3. (c) 2020 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Phenomenal study of microbial impact on hydrogen storage in aquifers: A

ID ENHANCED OIL-RECOVERY; PERMEABILITY; VISCOSITY; TRANSPORT; ENERGY
AB Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) has been considered as an integral part of energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources. Porous aquifers can serve as typical sites for this purpose due to their worldwide distribution and huge storage capacity. However, the diverse microbial species that inhabit the aquifers are known to be able to catalyze in-situ biochemical reactions within the hosting rock. These reactions can normally lead to microbial consumption of hydrogen, microbial clogging of pore space and thus affect hydrogen injection and withdrawal rates as reported in the literature. So far, these phenomena have been widely reported but rarely quantified. In this study, we build a coupled hydrological-mechanical-chemical-biological (HMCB) multiphysics model to simulate these microbe-related processes during UHS in aquifers. The model consists of a complete set of partial differential equations to describe: (1) rock deformation; (2) water-hydrogen two-phase flow; (3) microbes and dissolved hydrogen transport; (4) mineral dissolution/precipitation; and (5) microbial activities involving adsorption/desorption and growth/decay. All these processes are linked together through the porosity/ permeability models which consider the joint impacts of microbial clogging, mineral dissolution/precipitation and effective stress. This multiphysics model is verified against laboratory biochemical reaction data and microbial transport data. Then, the verified model is used to investigate the impacts of iron-reduction bacteria (IRB) activities on UHS in aquifers. Based on the simulation results, it can be concluded that (1) hydrogen saturation at the top surface of the aquifer is the greatest while microbial activities surrounding the injection well is stimulated the most; (2) microbial activities influence the initial few cycles of hydrogen injection and withdrawal but the impacts gradually diminish with the dissolution of Fe2O3; 2 O 3 ; (3) hydrogen recovery efficiency is degraded due to the combined effects of hydrogen consumption, water production and microbial clogging with the microbial clogging impact being the most significant; and (4) effective stress impacts aquifer permeability throughout UHS operations while microbial clogging influences it in the initial few cycles. For mineral dissolution/precipitation, the impact can be neglected.

AB Aviation has become an essential part of the modern world's ability to grow personal, market and international connections. To enable continued benefits while reducing emissions, future aircraft will need radical redesign and novel, complementary technologies. Hydrogen aircraft are potentially the means to emissions reduction. As part of the European Union's (EU's) Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking (CAJU), it is aimed to have hydrogen aircraft entering into service by 2035. To realise this, it would require the certification of these aircraft in a relatively short timeline, which the CONCERTO project aims to help enable. Given the lack of mature experimental designs and pending certification processes, this endeavour is ambitious. To accelerate this, dedicated preparation for the certification through regulatory analysis should be complete, requiring initial options for technologies and aircraft operations to be defined. The technologies and operations were defined, analysed and weighted in CONCERTO, upon which a Generic Concept was made, outlined in this paper, with Level 1 on the Certification Readiness Level Scale. The aircraft systems which are likely to experience the largest changes; Fuel Storage, Fuel Distribution, Propulsion, Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), Heat Exchange (HEX) System and Sensing and Monitoring for Hydrogen (H2), will be outlined in this paper with respect to their components and integration challenges, and the subsequent changes to operations to enable this.

AB Hydrogen (H-2) and oxygen (O-2) are critical electron donors and acceptors to promote the anaerobic and aerobic microbial transformation of chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs), respectively. Electrochemical technology can effectively supply H-2 and O-2 directly to an aquifer. However, the response of CHC transformation and microbial community structure to joint H-2 and O-2 are still unclear. In this work, microcosms containing different combinations of H-2 and O-2 were constructed with natural sediments and nine mixed CHCs. The joint H-2 and O-2 microcosm (H-2/O-2 microcosm) significantly promoted the biotransformation of trichloroethylene (TCE), trans-dichloroethene (tDCE) and chloroform (CF). Illumina sequencing analyses suggested that a particular microbial community was formed in the H-2/O-2 microcosm. The specific microbial species included Methyloversatilis, Dechloromonas, Sediminibacterium, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Curvibacter, Comamonas and Acidovorax, and the relative abundance of the tceA, phe and soxB genes synchronously increased. These results suggested that some specific microbes are potential CHC converters using H-2 and O-2 as energy sources, and aerobic and anaerobic transformations exist simultaneously in the H-2/O-2 microcosm. It provides a theoretical basis for establishing efficient green remediation technologies for CHC contaminated aquifers.

AB A novel low-temperature sealing method was developed to seal solid oxide fuel cells. The 3D Ni nanosheet array was pre-fabricated on faying surfaces of Crofer22APU interconnect and NiO-YSZ anode-support. Then it was covered with Au film without changing its morphology. This special nanostructure improved sintering efficiency between Ag nano particles and substrates. A dense joint was obtained at the low-temperature between 250 degrees C-300 degrees C. This method effectively avoided the oxidation of interconnect during sealing. When joints were sealed at 300 degrees C, the shear strength reached 16 MPa. The fracture was mainly located in the central Ag layer, presenting a significant plastic deformation. Due to the effective protection of Ni layer, joints also possessed excellent oxidation resistance in oxidizing atmosphere at 800 C for 400 h. After high-temperature oxidation, the shear strength was increased to 23 MPa, revealing an increasement of 43.8% compared with the as-sealed condition (16 MPa). This sealing method has great potential in sealing solid oxide fuel cells. It also can be extended to seal other energy-conversion devices. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB Amino 2-(2 '-hydroxyphenyl)benzazole derivatives are a class of molecules with excellent photophysical properties. Most of them can be applied as a fluorescent probe via the excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process. In this work, we focus on the effects of heteroatoms (O, S) and substituents (acetylacetone, hydrogen) in the derivatives. Using DFT/TDDFT methods with the B3LYP-D3BJ functionals, the absorption and emission peaks are in good agreement with the experimental data. Results of optimized structures, infrared vibrational spectra, and reduced density gradient present the existence of the ESIPT process in the S1 state in these molecules, it also indirectly shows that the heteroatom S is more than O, and the substituent acetylacetone is more than hydrogen has stronger hydrogen bonds. The proton transfer (PT) potential energy curves (PECs) qualitatively show that it is easier for the heteroatom S to induce ESIPT than that of O. The same for the substituent acetylacetone than that of hydrogen. Under the joint influence of the simultaneous stacking of heteroatom S and acetylacetone substituent, the energy barrier of the PT process can be effectively lowered, realizing a synergistic strategy, which can provide some guidance for the design of fluorescent materials.

AB We present a joint theoretical-experimental study on the inner-shell photoionization of hypoxanthine clusters in the gas phase. Simulations were performed using a computational strategy that combines molecular dynamics to explore the conformers of the clusters, density functional theory for geometry optimization and inner shell photoionization calculations. Two main intermolecular interactions are observed: hydrogen-bonds (HB) and pi - pi stacking. When increasing the cluster size, a combination of both kinds of interaction occurs. We show that such intermolecular interactions play a role in the chemical shift observed in X-ray photoemission spectroscopy experiments. In particular, we highlight the interplay between charge depletion and charge accumulation in regions where HBs stabilize the clusters.

AB We report a joint experimental (X-ray and neutron diffraction) and computational study on a binary mixture of ethylammonium nitrate (EAN), a protic ionic liquid, and methanol, the shortest alcohol. These two amphiphilic compounds are also characterized by the existence of an extended hydrogen bonding network in their neat states. We explore how these similar compounds structurally organize at the micro- and mesoscopic levels when mixed in a homogeneous state. The study demonstrates that the mixture is organized similarly to neat EAN, where the polar versus apolar dualism of the ionic liquid determines the segregation of alkyl tails into domains embedded into the ionic, percolating matrix. Methanol, due to the strong hydrogen bond with the nitrate anion, tends to intrude into this polar network, merging at EAN's polar-apolar interface. Further studies are proposed to rationalize the emerging mesoscopic density fluctuations that develop when approaching methanol-rich conditions.

AB Polycarbonate-based thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers (PCD-TPUs) were synthesized from polyhexamethylene carbonate diol, 4,4-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and 1,4 butanediol, intended for adhesive applications. The chemical structure, thermal transition temperature, phase separation morphology, mechanical properties, and adhesion properties were studied to elucidate the structure-properties relationship of PCD-TPUs as a function of hard segment content. The phase separation behavior was described as a shift of the glass transition temperature and the dimension size of the hard domain. It was found that the higher hard segment fraction led to a lower degree of phase separation as well as a reduction in tensile strength and elongation at break. The hydrogen bonding characteristic of PCD-TPUs was investigated by FTIR. The presence of free hydrogen bonded PCD-TPUs benefits the higher peel strength since it promotes hydrogen bonding interaction with the substrate. The peel strength was obtained from PCD-TPUs/stainless steel joint. The adhesion properties of the adhesive system were strongly influenced by the soft segment. These results can establish the possibility of designing new formulations for hot melt adhesive.

AB In this study we investigate the mechanochemical regeneration of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) from a system comprising hydrated sodium metaborate (NaBO2 center dot 4 H2O) and magnesium hydride (MgH2). We explore the individual and joint impact of key operational parameters (rotational speed, milling time, ball-to-powder ratio (BPR), and molar ratio) on the regeneration yield. Furthermore, a method for quantifying chemical conversion is introduced relying only on water and thus, offering environmental benefits. This approach additionally facilitates the production and storage of a "ready-to-use"NaBH4 solution with minimal losses at room temperature. Notably, a yield of 90% is achieved, with a 20% reduction in rotational speed compared to prior literature. This research contributes to sustainable hydrogen storage and presents practical advancements in mechanochemical processes.

AB The economic competitiveness of the current fleet of light water reactors may be improved by coupling nuclear reactors to industrial facilities. This will allow flexible use high-quality steam or electric power from the reactor when the cost of electricity is low compared to the generation cost. One promising application is hydrogen production. Understanding the nuclear plant response to steam offtake is important for safe operation of the reactor facility. Conceptual analysis has been performed for coupling pressurized water reactors (PWRs) to high temperature steam electrolysis hydrogen production; however, corresponding work done for boiling water re-actors (BWRs) has not been published, even though BWRs make up 30% of the US operating fleet. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of coupling a generic BWR to a hydrogen production facility. The system response is analyzed for a 15% reduction in the electrical power output. This work shows that when steam is extracted from the main steam header without appropriate controls modifications, reactor power will increase beyond 100% rated power. We present addition analysis to maintain power below rated conditions by varying feedwater recirculation pump speeds.

AB The reactions of ruthenium clusters, Ru-x(+) (x = 2-5), and ruthenium oxide clusters, RuxOy+ (x = 2-5, y = 1-2), with water molecules have been investigated by gas phase ion trap mass spectrometry and first principle density functional calculations. The joint experimental and theoretical study reveals that the reactions of the ruthenium oxide clusters with water are considerably more efficient. This is assigned theoretically to the stronger binding of the water molecules to RuxOy+ and, more importantly, to water activation leading to an efficient hydrogen transfer reaction from the water molecules to the oxygen atoms of the ruthenium oxide clusters. The theoretically predicted hydrogen shift reaction has been confirmed experimentally through O-16/O-18 isotope exchange experiments. Calculated energy profiles for the reactions of selected oxide clusters with water illustrate that the oxygen isotope exchange relies on the facile transfer of hydrogen atoms via [1,3] shift reactions between the oxygen atoms of the complexes due to the relatively low barriers involved. These findings might open perspectives for the future realization of water oxidation driven by ruthenium oxide clusters.

AB The isotope effect on intrinsic rotation was studied at the Joint European Torus (JET) tokamak. With the unique capability of JET to operate with tritium (T), for the first time, experiments in hydrogen (H), deuterium (D) and T in Ohmic plasmas were compared. Two rotation reversals per isotope type are observed in plasma density scans spanning the linear and the saturated Ohmic confinement regimes. A clear isotope mass dependence is observed at the higher densities. The magnitude of the core rotation was found to depend on isotope mass, with stronger co-current rotation observed in H. Change on intrinsic rotation characteristics coexist with a stronger thermal energy confinement in T.

AB EH40 ship steel was underwater wet-welded by shielded metal-arc welding at a depth of 7 m in the open sea, using austenitic electrodes. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the joint were estimated with microhardness measurements, bending and tensile testing, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The highest microhardness was recorded on the coarse-grained heat-affected zone of the base metal, which displayed a mixed bainite-martensite microstructure, while the welds possessed a fully columnar dendritic austenitic structure. The specimens exhibited higher ultimate strength and elongation in longitudinal tensile tests than in transverse ones. Moreover, the specimens satisfied face bending tests but failed in root bending ones. Hydrogen-induced microcracks, which were observed in a lath martensite layer at the fusion boundary, became the fracture initiation region both in bending and transverse tensile tests.

AB The sole H2 and O2 usually promote chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs) biotransformation by several mechanisms, in-cluding reductive dechlorination and aerobic oxidation. However, the mechanism of the CHCs transformation in joint H2 and O2 system (H2/O2 system) is still unclear. In this study, the degradation kinetics of trichloroethene (TCE) were investigated and DNA stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) were used to explore the synergistic mechanism of functional microorganisms on TCE degradation under the condition of H2/O2 coexistence. In the H2/O2 microcosm, TCE was sig-nificantly removed by 13.00 mu M within 40 days, much higher than N2, H2 and O2 microcosms, and 1,1-DCE was de-tected as an intermediate. DNA-SIP technology identified three anaerobic TCE metabolizers, five aerobic TCE metabolizers, nine hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria (HOB), some TCE metabolizers utilizing limited O2, and some anaer-obic dechlorinating bacteria reductively using H2 to dechlorinate TCE. It is also confirmed for the first time that 3 OUTs belonging to Methyloversatilis and SH-PL14 can simultaneously utilize H2 and O2 as energy sources to grow and metabolize TCE or 1,1-DCE. HOB may provide carbon sources or electron acceptors or donors for TCE biotransfor-mation. These findings confirm the coexistence of anaerobic and aerobic TCE metabolizers and degraders, which syn-ergistically promoted the conversion of TCE in the joint H2/O2 system. Our results provide more information about the functional microbe resources and synergetic mechanisms for TCE degradation.

AB Hydrogen (H2) therapy is a new and effective approach for treatment of inflammation-related diseases. Nevertheless, the non-polarity and poor solubility of H2 under physiological status lead to its limited therapeutic effect. Here, we developed spatially separated Au/TiO2 nanodumbbells (NDs) as H2 generators and further conjugated them with Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptides (labeled R-Au/TiO2) to achieve inflammatory joint targeting for precise treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The Au/TiO2 NDs structure combines the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) excitation of gold nanorods (Au NRs) and Schottky junction to exhibit very efficient photocatalytic H2 production under near-infrared light irradiation. In situ generated H2 gas acts as an active ingredient to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and clear inflammation. Through active H2 scavenging of ROS and inflammation, R-Au/TiO2 alleviated oxidative stress and reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines, showing considerable reduction in joint destruction and suppression of arthritis severity in a collagen-induced arthritis mouse model. Furthermore, the photothermal properties of R-Au/TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) endow them with photothermal therapeutic effects, which synergize with the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress of H2, further enhancing the therapeutic effect. Therefore, R-Au/TiO2 NPs show great promise for treating RA and advancing clinical translation.

AB We studied the long-term corrosion behavior of carbide/316L stainless steel joints brazed with AgCuX alloys (X = Ti, In). The results show that the Cu-based solid solution (Cu (s,s)) in the brazing alloy is the weak link of corrosion germination. Ti increases the Fermi level and decreases the *H adsorption energy (delta G(*H)) of Cu(s,s), thus leading to a higher thermodynamic tendency of hydrogen evolution. In contrast, In decreases the Fermi level and the d band center of Cu (s, s) leading to a positive delta G(*H), which improves the corrosion resistance. The results agree with the mechanical performance tests.

AB Despite the success of standard antiseptic irrigation solutions in reducing periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) rates, there is still a need for more effective solutions. Synergistic use of povidone-iodine (PI) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has shown promising results; however, the optimal solution concentration balancing bactericidal activity and osseointegration remains unknown. This study aims to evaluate the impact of these antiseptic irrigation solutions on osseointegration and the bone-implant interface strength in vivo. Forty C57BL/6 mice underwent bilateral tibial implantation surgery and were randomly allocated into three groups receiving 0.3% PI, 10% PI mixed with 3% H2O2, or saline as irrigation solutions intraoperatively. Assessments were performed on postoperative Days 1 and 28, including plain radiographs, microcomputed tomography (microCT) evaluation, histological analysis, immunohistochemistry, and biomechanical pull-out testing. No wound complications were observed. MicroCT scans revealed no differences in peri-implant trabecular bone parameters. Biomechanical pull-out testing showed no differences in the bone-implant interface strength across groups. Histological analysis indicated no differences in bone and bone marrow percentage areas among treatment groups. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated no differences among groups in peri-implant osteocalcin, osterix, or endomucin-positive cells. In conclusion, using either antiseptic irrigation solution showed no differences in osseointegration parameters compared to the control group, demonstrating safety and the absence of toxicity.Clinical RelevanceDilute 0.3% povidone-iodine and a 1:1 combination of 10% povidone-iodine mixed with 3% hydrogen peroxide can be safely used during primary and revision total joint arthroplasty without compromising osseointegration or causing wound complications.

AB The design of future electricity systems depends, among others, on reducing costs for renewable technologies. Particularly costs for PV panels and batteries are predicted to decrease significantly. At the same time, as the share of renewable energies increases, there is a greater need for flexibility. Energy policies are promoting the use of hydrogen generated by electricity which offers an alternative to provide flexibility to the system. This study investigates flexibility provision due to the coupling of the electricity and hydrogen sector in Europe in 2050 with a cost optimization model. The results show that investment cost reductions lead to a balanced contribution of wind and solar energy in the optimal generation mix but requires immense transmission and storage capacities. Batteries balance the daily feed-in from PV panels, whereas salt caverns with low-capacity costs compensate the irregular availability of wind resources. Implementing joint optimization can reduce total costs by up to 14%, while the coupling of electricity and hydrogen sectors can decrease electrical storage needs by 35% and substitute 40% of electrical transmission capacity. It also improves the integration of renewable energies and reduces curtailment by two-thirds. Thus, this coupling offers valuable additions in providing flexibility to the energy system.

AB 30CrMo steel is a core material for oil and gas field equipment (e.g., sucker rods, drill pipe joints), but its long-term service in sulfur-containing downhole often causes stress corrosion cracking (SCC) failure. This study systematically elucidates the SCC behavior of 30CrMo steel under H2S simulation systems constructed with chloride-containing acidic thiosulfate of different concentrations. Tests showed the corrosion rate exhibited a non-monotonic relationship with thiosulfate concentration, peaking at 0.340 mm/yin 1 x 10-2mol/L solution, with a dense FeOOH layer and loose mackinawite layer formed on the surface. Severe pitting (maximum depth 99.73 mu m) occurred at 1 x 10-3 mol/L, accompanied by the highest subsurface hydrogen concentration. Moreover, the SCC mechanism evolved with concentration: low (1 x 10-4 mol/L) and high (1 x 10-1 mol/L) dominated by anodic dissolution (AD) and Hydrogen Enhanced Local Plasticity (HELP); intermediate (1 x 10-3-1 x 10-2 mol/L) exhibited significant synergy between AD and Hydrogen Enhanced Decohesion (HEDE). This study revealed thiosulfate concentration's regulatory effect on 30CrMo steel's HE-SCC behavior, providing a simple, safe new strategy for service safety assessment of sulfur-containing oil and gas field equipment materials.

AB The design and development of high-performance electrocatalysts is crucial to improve the utility of anodic reaction for energy-saving hydrogen production. Herein, we present a novel catalyst with 2D/3D multistage structure for the electro-oxidation of renewable biomass and harmful waste to assist hydrogen generation. The hierarchical configuration of NiO/CoO nanosheets interconnected by hollow carbon spheres, leveraging both 2D and 3D advantages. This structure provides rich surface and edge active sites as well as affluent electron and mass transfer pathways, resulting in the accelerated dynamics of electro-oxidation. The hollow carbon spheres serve as a buffering agent to alleviate the strain caused by repetitive redox reactions during electrolysis, thereby bestowing exceptional structural and chemical stability for prolonged operational durability. Additionally, the multiple continuous hetero-interfaces between NiO and CoO, NiO and carbon as well as CoO and carbon can ensure the fast electron transport, leading to the expedited reaction kinetics with the synergistic effect of phase engineering between NiO, CoO and carbon shell. As a result, the 3D carbon shells jointed 2D NiO/CoO hybrids demonstrate promising catalytic activities on electro-oxidation for energy-efficient hydrogen production (similar to 100 %(FE)) coupled with urea oxidation and formic acid synthesis with excellent selectivity (95.40 %) and satisfied faradic efficiency (91.6 %).

AB Objective: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gaseous mediator produced in the body. In experimental models, endogenously produced H2S has been shown to have pro-inflammatory effects. The aim of this study was to investigate whether H2S is present in three common rheumatic diseases, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), gout and osteoarthritis (OA) and to determine if H2S levels correlate with disease activity.
   Methods: Patients with RA, gout, OA, and healthy controls (n = 30 each) were recruited. Plasma and where possible, synovial fluid (SF), were obtained. Levels of H2S and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (a known inflammatory marker as a positive control) were determined and assessed for their relationship with disease activity.
   Results: SF-H2S levels were significantly elevated in both RA and gout when compared to respective plasma levels. Plasma levels of H2S were not different from those in healthy controls in patients with either RA or gout. In OA, plasma levels of H2S were significantly elevated compared to healthy controls. In RA, SF-H2S levels correlated with Disease Activity Score (DAS)-28 and tender joint count.
   Conclusion: H2S is present in the joint and acts as a pro-inflammatory mediator in rheumatic diseases. H2S may be a novel therapeutic target for these conditions.

AB In this paper, comparative experiments were conducted to investigate the relationship between the welding procedure used (autogenous and non-autogenous welding) and the mechanical properties in association with the corresponding microstructures of laser beam welded AA2915 plates without the removal of surface oxide layer. The results showed that significant reduction in quantity and size of hydrogen-induced pores could be obtained by using conventional filler wire AA4047 (Al12Si) in comparison with the autogenous welds which led to relatively higher mechanical properties with the tensile strength approaching 59.5% of the base metal along the rolling orientation. The morphologies and distribution feature of the solidified structures of the experimental workpieces were analyzed in the light of 3D finite element model. Deep etching was incorporated to induce the contrast for clear observation of secondary phases. The results indicate that the grain structure of non-autogenous welded joints was more stable against the changes in welding process parameters due to the relatively higher constitutional undercooling at the growth front of the solidifying grains. The addition of Si was believed to decrease the absorbed hydrogen volume via diluting the content of Cu and Li in the welded seam, thereby decreasing the porosity and improving the mechanical properties.

TI Effects of temperature and mass conservation on the typical chemical
   sequences of hydrogen oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS

DT Article
ID DYNAMICS; VALIDATION; MODEL
AB Macroscopic properties of reacting mixtures are necessary to design synthetic strategies, determine yield, and improve the energy and atom efficiency of many chemical processes. The set of time-ordered sequences of chemical species are one representation of the evolution from reactants to products. However, only a fraction of the possible sequences is typical, having the majority of the joint probability and characterizing the succession of chemical nonequilibrium states. Here, we extend a variational measure of typicality and apply it to atomistic simulations of a model for hydrogen oxidation over a range of temperatures. We demonstrate an information-theoretic methodology to identify typical sequences under the constraints of mass conservation. Including these constraints leads to an improved ability to learn the chemical sequence mechanism from experimentally accessible data. From these typical sequences, we show that two quantities defining the variational typical set of sequences-the joint entropy rate and the topological entropy rate-increase linearly with temperature. These results suggest that, away from explosion limits, data over a narrow range of thermodynamic parameters could be sufficient to extrapolate these typical features of combustion chemistry to other conditions.

AB The paper analyzes the technical state of the hydrogen sulfide absorber of the catalytic reforming unit and hydraulic cleaning containing hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide with its operation time of 168,200 h (21 yr). 17G1S manganese-silicon steel is used in the absorber structure. In operation, in the vessel shell, a cone-shaped region of subsurface metal lamination is developed across the entire periphery. The region is under constant observation using the methods of nondestructive testing. In case the region of the damaged metal intersects the longitudinal welded joint, the vessel shell is being repaired. A low-temperature (to the boiling point) hydrogen-related fracture of metal in the petroleum refining due to hydrogen saturation and its accompanying cracking are considered to be the most critical types of corrosion of oilfield equipment. In view of this, a set of laboratory tests using specimens of metal templates cut out of the damaged shell region has been performed to evaluate the serviceability of the absorber, as well as to determine the effect of hydrogen sulfide on the structure and mechanical characteristics of the metal. It is found that the process of lamination is detected inside the metal intersection and is caused by the macroinhomogeneity of rolled metal, i.e., the axial segregation zone, which is the most critical region of the deformed metal. X-ray phase analysis lends credence to the metallurgical nature of lamination of the shell plate. The results of metallographic examination imply that the subsurface hydrogen-induced cracking is caused by aggregation of brittle refined nonmetallic inclusions, mainly of MnS, and it propagates chiefly over sulfide films along the rolled metal direction. The results of experimental investigations on the specimens are provided. From the fractographic investigations on the fractured surface of specimens after mechanical testing it is established that the process of fracture is ductile occurring via microvoids coalescence in the fracture of bridges between them. The key mechanism of microvoids formation is the inhomogeneity of the plastic strain in the micro-volumes around the nonmetallic inclusions.

AB Chloroform (CHCl3) and dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) are model systems for the study of intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonds and halogen-halogen interactions. Here we report a joint computational (density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT) modelling) and experimental (Raman scattering) study on the behaviour of the crystals of these compounds up to a pressure of 32 GPa. Comparing the experimental information on the Raman band positions and intensities with the results of calculations enabled us to characterize the pressure-induced evolution of the crystal structure of both compounds. We find that the previously proposed P6(3) phase of CHCl3 is in fact a metastable structure, and that up to 32 GPa the ambient-pressure Pnma structure is the ground state polymorph of this compound. For CH2Cl2 we confirm the stability of the ambient-pressure Pbcn structure up to 32 GPa. We show that the high-pressure evolution of the crystal geometry of CHCl3 in the Pnma structure is a result of the subtle balance between dipole-dipole interactions, hydrogen bonds and Cl center dot center dot center dot Cl contacts. For CH2Cl2 (Pbcn structure) the dipole-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonds are the main factors influencing the pressure-induced changes in the geometry.

AB Hydrogen-bonded, side-chain-functionalized supramolecular poly(alkyl methacrylate)s were investigated as light- and temperature-responsive reversible adhesives that are useful for bonding and debonding on demand applications. Here, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) was functionalized with 2-ureido-4[1H]pyrimidinone (UPy) via a hexamethylenediisocyanate (HMDI) linker, to create a monomer (UPy-HMDI-HEMA) that serves to form supramolecular cross-links by way of forming quadruple hydrogen bonded dimers. UPy-HMDI-HEMA was copolymerized with either hexyl methacrylate or butyl meth acrylate to create copolymers comprising 2.5, 5, or 10 mol % of the cross-linker. The mechanical properties of all (co)polymers were investigated with stress strain experiments and dynamic mechanical analysis. Furthermore, the adhesive properties were studied at temperatures between 20 and 60 degrees C by testing single lap joints formed with stainless steel substrates. It was found that increasing the concentration of the UPy-HMDI-HEMA cross-linker leads to improved mechanical and adhesive properties at elevated temperatures. Concurrently, the reversibility of the bond formation remained unaffected, where rebonded samples displayed the same adhesive strength as regularly bonded samples. Debonding on demand abilities were also tested exemplarily for one copolymer, which for light-induced debonding experiments was blended with a UV-absorber that served as light heat converter. Single lap joints were subjected to a constant force and heated or irradiated with UV light until debonding occurred. The necessary debonding temperature was comparable for direct heating and UV irradiation and varied between 28 and 82 degrees C, depending on the applied force. The latter also influenced the debonding time, which under the chosen conditions ranged from 30 s to 12 min.

TI Optical Measurements of a Lower Calorific Values-Combustor Operated in a

   ASME
LA English
DT Article
ID SYSTEMS
AB In a recent joint research project, a new FLOX (R)-combustion system was developed to couple a fixed-bed gasifier with a micro gas turbine (MGT). Product gases from biomass gasification exhibit low calorific values and varying compositions of mainly H-2, CO, CO2, N-2, and CH4. Furthermore, combustion characteristics differ significantly compared to the commonly used natural gas. As the FLOX-technology is considered as efficient and fuel-flexible featuring low emissions of hazardous pollutants, the design of the lower calorific value (LCV) combustor is based on it. It contains a two-staged combustor consisting of a jet-stabilized main stage adapted from the FLOX-concept combined with a swirl stabilized pilot stage. The combustor was operated in a Turbec T100 test rig using an optically accessible combustion chamber, which allowed OH*-chemiluminescence and OH-PLIF measurements for various fuel compositions. In particular, the hydrogen content in the synthetically mixed fuel gas was varied from 0% to 30%. The exhaust gas composition was additionally analyzed regarding CO, NOx, and unburned hydrocarbons. The results provide a comprehensive insight into the flame behavior during turbine operation. Efficient combustion and stable operation of the MGT was observed for all fuel compositions, while the hydrogen showed a strong influence. It is remarkable that with hydrogen contents higher than 9%, no OH radicals were detected within the inner recirculation zone, while they were increasingly entrained below hydrogen contents of 9%. Without hydrogen, the inner recirculation zone was completely filled with OH radicals and the highest concentrations were detected there. Therefore, the results indicate a different flame behavior with low and high hydrogen contents. Although the flame shape and position were affected, pollutant emissions remained consistently below 10 ppm based on 15% O-2. Only in the case of 0% hydrogen, CO-emissions increased to 43 ppm, which are still meeting the emission limits. Thus, the combustor allows operation with syngases having hydrogen contents from 0% to 30%.

AB Mimicking anisotropic features is crucial for developing artificial load-bearing soft tissues such as menisci). Here, a high-density hydrogen bond locking (HDHBL) strategy, involving preloading a poly(N-acryloylsemicarbazide) (PNASC) hydrogel with an aqueous solution containing a hydrogen bond breaking agent, followed by water exchange, to fabricate anisotropic high-strength hydrogels are proposed. During this process, multiple high-density hydrogen bonds of the PNASC network are re-established, firmly freezing oriented molecular chains, and creating a network with an anisotropic microstructure. The resulting anisotropic hydrogels exhibit superior mechanical properties: tensile strength over 9 MPa, Young's modulus exceeding 120 MPa along the orientation direction, and fatigue thresholds exceeding 1900 J m-2. These properties meet the mechanical demands for load-bearing tissue substitutes compared to other reported anti-fatigue hydrogels. This strategy enables the construction of an anisotropic meniscal scaffold composed of circumferentially oriented microfibers by preloading a digital light processing-3D printed PNASC hydrogel-based wedge-shaped construct with a resilient poly(N-acryloyl glycinamide) hydrogel. The 12-week implantation of a meniscus scaffold in rabbit knee joints after meniscectomy demonstrates a chondroprotective effect on the femoral condyle and tibial plateau, substantially ameliorating the progression of osteoarthritis. The HDHBL strategy enables the fabrication of various anisotropic polymer hydrogels, broadening their scope of application.
   A high-density hydrogen-bond locking strategy is proposed for customizing circumferentially anisotropic meniscal skeletons. It involves preloading digital light processing 3D-printed highly stiff gels, followed by water exchange to reconstruct multiple hydrogen bonds, freezing the molecular chains and anisotropic microstructures. Biomimetic meniscus scaffolds, fabricated by infilling the resilient hydrogel into a stiff skeleton, efficiently protect articular cartilage and alleviate osteoarthritis progression. image

AB Objective: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common subtype of arthritis. To date, treatment of OA focuses primarily on alleviating pain and improving joint function. The lack of a vascular system within synovial joints and the rapid removal of agents due to synovial exchange hinder continuous delivery of OA drugs. However, these obstacles are being addressed by promising nanoscale drugs.
   Methods: We synthesize and assemble a hydrogen peroxide [H2O2, belongs to the category of active oxygen species (ROS)]-sensitive nanomicelle, which is loaded with the anti-inflammation drug dexamethasone and chondrogenic differentiation factor cartilage-derivedmor-phogeneticprotein-1. The micelle can induce bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to repair cartilage while inhibiting joint inflammation.
   Results: The prepared nanoparticles were of uniform size and displayed an obvious core-shell structure. Under H2O2 stimulation, the shell layer could be removed gradually. The drug-loaded micelle effectively inhibited proliferation of activated macrophages, induced macrophage apoptosis with an anti-inflammatory effect, and caused the BMSCs to differentiate into chondrocytes.
   Conclusion: This work provides an experimental and theoretical basis for further development of a drug-loaded micelle in the healing of osteoarthritis.

AB A relationship between adsorption layer structure at different stages of sorbent filling, hydrophilicity, and spatial orientation of saponin in chitosan phase is revealed by joint analysis of the kinetic curves of saponin sorption, IR spectra of chitosan and saponin samples, and computer-simulation data. The sorbent-sorbate complex is formed due to electrostatic interactions between protonated amino groups in chitosan and carboanions of glucuronic acid in saponin, as well as hydrogen bonding between NH2 and OH groups in chitosan molecules and OH groups in the carbohydrate moiety of saponin molecules.

AB The bonding properties at the interface between the first wall oxide dispersion strengthened tungsten (ODS-W) and the heat sink copper (Cu) are vital for their application in future nuclear fusion reactors. However, the immiscibility and significant differences in the coefficient of thermal expansion between ODS-W and Cu pose considerable challenges for bonding these two materials. This study utilizes anodization and hydrogen reduction processes to form a nanoporous structure on the surface of ODS-W, thereby achieving effective bonding between ODS-W and Cu by spark plasma sintering (SPS). The effects of the anodization parameters on the surface characteristics of ODS-W, and the influence of the bonding temperature on the interfacial microstructure and mechanical properties of the ODS-W/Cu joints were investigated. The results demonstrate that under an anodization condition of 50 V for 40 min, a nanoporous structure with an average pore size of about 90 nm can forms on the surfaces of ODS-W. This significantly increases the surface roughness, thereby enhancing the interfacial bonding of ODS-W with Cu during SPS. As the bonding temperature increases, the interfacial microstructure changes from linear to serrated shape, effectively suppressing crack propagation and forming a stronger mechanical interlock between ODS-W and Cu. This significantly enhances the mechanical properties of the joints. Typically, at a bonding temperature of 1000 degrees C, the tensile strength of the anodized ODS-W/Cu joints reaches 245.2 MPa, which is 157.9 % higher than that of directly bonded joints. Additionally, the tensile fracture primarily occurs within the Cu substrate, transitioning from brittle to ductile fracture modes.

AB The joint international project between Niigata University (Japan) and the Korea Institute of Energy Research, KIER (Korea) on "Solar Demonstration of Water-Splitting Reactor using Ceramic Foam Device" has two goals. (1) Develop a solar reactor using reactive cerium oxide foam devices for high-temperature two-step thermochemical water-splitting cycle. (2) Test its performance under various operational methods using a 40 kW(th) solar furnace driven by natural solar energy. The reactive CeO2/MPSZ (MgO partially stabilized zirconia) foam device for two-step water-splitting was developed and prepared by Niigata University/Japan; it involves coating an inert zirconia foam matrix with reactive CeO2. In this paper, highly reactive CeO2 particles were used the redox material in CeO2/MPSZ foam devices to investigate the use of solar energy for hydrogen production. The solar-driven thermochemical two-step water-splitting cycle was demonstrated using the 40 kWth KIER solar furnace in Korea combined with the CeO2/MPSZ foam device. At the center of the foam device, temperatures were 1500 degrees C-1600 degrees C during the thermal reduction step and 600 degrees C-1100 degrees C during the subsequent water decomposition step. Hydrogen was successfully produced from the CeO2/MPSZ foam device, and profiles for hydrogen production and CeO2 conversion indicated definitely improved operations compared to earlier studies.

ID FUEL; OPTIMIZATION
AB With the continuous development of hydrogen power generation devices, the application of hydrogen internal combustion engines (HICE), fuel cells (FC) and other power generation devices in the transportation field is also increasing. The complementary characteristics of FCs and HICEs in terms of power characteristics and high efficiency range make their application possible in high-power load scenarios such as rail transit. This paper focuses on the power system of intercity electric multiple unit (EMU) trains, using FC, HICE, and lithium batteries (LB) as power sources, and has conducted research on parameter matching and energy management for hybrid power systems (HPS). For parameter matching, the annual comprehensive cost is proposed to optimize the configuration of each source, achieving collaborative optimization of multiple objectives such as mass, volume, and operation and maintenance costs of the HPS. For energy management, a hierarchical control structure is built in this paper: In bottom-level control, based on the joint efficiency distribution of FC and HICE, the consumption coefficient fusion method is proposed to solve the power allocation between them; In top-level control, a new concept named battery cost state are proposed to measure the real-time cost of the energy stored in LB, and thus derived the cost state coefficient to accurately calculate the optimal output power of the hydrogen power system, thereby achieving the optimal power allocation between the hydrogen power system and the battery. Finally, according to the actual operating data, the Typhoon hardware in the loop platform is also used to verify the realtime control of the proposed method, and the results show that the proposed method has significant advantages in both hydrogen consumption and low fluctuations.

AB Aims
   Giant cell tumour of bone (GCTB) is a locally aggressive lesion that is difficult to treat as salvaging the joint can be associated with a high rate of local recurrence (LR). We evaluated the risk factors for tumour relapse after treatment of a GCTB of the limbs.
   Methods
   A total of 354 consecutive patients with a GCTB underwent joint salvage by curettage and reconstruction with bone graft and/or cement or en bloc resection. Patient, tumour, and treatment factors were analyzed for their impact on LR. Patients treated with denosumab were excluded.
   Results
   There were 53 LRs (15%) at a mean 30.5 months (5 to 116). LR was higher after curettage (18.4%) than after resection (4.6%; p = 0.008). Neither pathological fracture (p = 0.240), Campanacci grade (p = 0.734), soft-tissue extension (p = 0.297), or tumour size (p = 0.872) affected the risk of recurrence. Joint salvage was possible in 74% of patients overall (262/354), and 98% after curettage alone (262/267). Of 49 patients with LR after curettage, 44 (90%) underwent repeated curettage and joint salvage. For patients treated by curettage, only age less than 30 years (p = 0.042) and location in the distal radius (p = 0.043) predicted higher LR. The rate of LR did not differ whether cement or bone graft was used (p = 0.753), but may have been reduced by the use of hydrogen peroxide (p = 0.069). Complications occurred in 15.3% of cases (54/354) and did not differ by treatment.
   Conclusion
   Most patients with a GCTB can undergo successful joint salvage by aggressive curettage, even in the presence of a soft-tissue mass, pathological fracture, or a large lesion, with an 18.4% risk of local recurrence. However, 90% of local relapses after curettage can be treated by repeat joint salvage. Maximizing joint salvage is important to optimize long-term function since most patients with a GCTB are young adults. Younger patients and those with distal radius tumours treated with joint-sparing procedures have a higher rate of local relapse and may require more aggressive treatment and closer follow-up.

ID OXIDATION
AB Based on the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), infrared absorption spectra of porous silicon are calculated by using an ordered pore model, in which columns of silicon atoms are removed along the [001] direction and dangling bonds are initially saturated with hydrogen atoms. When these atoms on the pore surface are gradually replaced by oxygen ones, the ab-initio infrared absorption spectra reveal oxygen, hydroxyl, and coupled hydrogen- oxygen vibrational modes. In a parallel way, freestanding porous silicon samples were prepared by using electrochemical etching and they were further thermally oxidized in a dry oxygen ambient. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to investigate the surface modifications caused by oxygen adsorption. In particular, the predicted hydroxyl and oxygen bound to the silicon pore surface are confirmed. Finally, a global analysis of measured transmittance spectra has been performed by means of a combined DFPT and thin-film optics approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To improve the energy utilization rate and realize the low-carbon emission of a park integrated energy system (PIES), this paper proposes an optimal operation strategy for multiple PIESs. Firstly, the electrical power cooperative trading framework of multiple PIESs is constructed. Secondly, the hydrogen blending mechanism and carbon capture system and power-to-gas system joint operation model are introduced to establish the model of each PIES. Then, based on the Nash bargaining game theory, a multi-PIES cooperative trading and operation model with electrical power cooperative trading is constructed. Then, the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is used to solve the two subproblems. Finally, case studies analysis based on scene analysis is performed. The results show that the cooperative operation model reduces the total cost of a PIES more effectively compared with independent operation. Meanwhile, the efficient utilization and production of hydrogen are the keys to achieve carbon reduction and an efficiency increase in a PIES.

AB AZ91 magnesium alloys modified by Er and Ce are fabricated (referred to as AZErCe) and their stress corrosion cracking (SCC) behaviors are studied by slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) method in air, humid atmosphere with and without chloride. The addition of Er and Ce promotes the formation of Al3Er and Al11Ce3 phase and reduces both the size and the volume fraction of -phase. AZErCe possess improved corrosion resistance and passivation characteristic compared to AZ91 due to the reduced micro-galvanic corrosion and the more protective films. SSRT tests demonstrate that the joint addition of Er and Ce effectively improve the SCC resistance of AZ91 alloy. In particular, the representative fractography of AZErCe exhibits lesser effect of hydrogen embrittlement than AZ91. The improved SCC resistance of AZErCe can be ascribed to the presence of Er and Ce, which alleviate corrosion of Mg matrix and thus weaken the effect of hydrogen embrittlement on SCC resistance.

AB Pyridoxal 5 '-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes have been extensively studied for their ability to fine-tune PLP cofactor electronics to promote a wide array of chemistries. Neutron crystallography offers a straightforward approach to studying the electronic states of PLP and the electrostatics of enzyme active sites, responsible for the reaction specificities, by enabling direct visualization of hydrogen atom positions. Here we report a room-temperature joint X-ray/neutron structure of aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) with pyridoxamine 5 '-phosphate (PMP), the cofactor product of the first half reaction catalyzed by the enzyme. Between PMP N-SB and catalytic Lys258 N zeta amino groups an equally shared deuterium is observed in an apparent low-barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB). Density functional theory calculations were performed to provide further evidence of this LBHB interaction. The structural arrangement and the juxtaposition of PMP and Lys258, facilitated by the LBHB, suggests active site preorganization for the incoming ketoacid substrate that initiates the second half-reaction.

AB A joint experimental and numerical investigation of turbulent flame anchoring at externally heated walls is presented. The phenomenon has primarily been studied for laminar flames and micro-combustion while this study focuses on large-scale applications and elevated Reynolds number flows. Therefore, a novel burner design is developed and examined for a diverse set of operating conditions. Hydroxyl radical chemiluminescence measurements are employed to validate the numerical method. The numerical investigation evaluates the performance of various hydrogen/air kinetics, Reynolds-averaged turbulence models and the eddy dissipation concept (EDC) as a turbulence-chemistry interaction model. Simulation results show minor differences between detailed chemical mechanisms but pronounced deviations for a reduced kinetic. The baseline k-omega turbulence model is assessed to most accurately predict flame front position and shape. Universal applicability of EDC modeling constants is contradicted. Conclusively, the flame anchoring concept is considered a promising approach for pilot flames in continuous combustion devices. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB Hydrogen bonding is a central concept in chemistry and biochemistry, and so it continues to attract intense study. Here, we examine hydrogen bonding in the H2S dimer, in comparison with the well-studied water dimer, in unprecedented detail. We record a mass-selected IR spectrum of the H2S dimer in superfluid helium nanodroplets. We are able to resolve a rotational substructure in each of the three distinct bands and, based on it, assign these to vibration-rotation-tunneling transitions of a single intramolecular vibration. With the use of high-level potential and dipole-moment surfaces we compute the vibration-rotation-tunneling dynamics and far-infrared spectrum with rigorous quantum methods. Intramolecular mode Vibrational Self-Consistent-Field and Configuration-Interaction calculations provide the frequencies and intensities of the four SH-stretch modes, with a focus on the most intense, the donor bound SH mode which yields the experimentally observed bands. We show that the intermolecular modes in the H2S dimer are substantially more delocalized and more strongly mixed than in the water dimer. The less directional nature of the hydrogen bonding can be quantified in terms of weaker electrostatic and more important dispersion interactions. The present study reconciles all previous spectroscopic data, and serves as a sensitive test for the potential and dipole-moment surfaces.
   Hydrogen bonding is a central concept in (bio)chemistry and has been intensively studied in the prototypical complex H2O-H2O. In this joint experimental/theoretical study, the authors find hydrogen bonding in H2S-H2S to be distinctly different.

AB Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic synovitis and progressive joint damage, primarily caused by oxidative injury from reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hypoxia in immune cells. Hydrogen (H2) has demonstrated potential in scavenging excess ROS and correcting redox imbalances, while oxygen supplementation can alleviate hypoxia, promoting inflammatory remission. This study introduces a novel FA-HA-PtPdCo-TiO2 (F-HPPCT) nano-system for targeted RA therapy. Comprising TiO2 quantum dots on PtPdCo polyhedra, decorated with folate-hyaluronic acid (FA-HA), F-HPPCT selectively targets inflammatory cells. Its metal-semiconductor heterostructure forms Schottky junctions that enhance electron transfer, enabling efficient hydrogen evolution and a photothermal effect under near-infrared light. Additionally, F-HPPCT mimics catalase activity, decomposing overexpressed H2O2 to relieve hypoxia and oxidative stress. The system synergistically scavenges ROS and replenishes oxygen, effectively reducing inflammation and oxidative damage. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments in arthritis models confirmed its efficacy, highlighting F-HPPCT's potential as a groundbreaking nanocatalyst for gas therapy in RA treatment.

In this investigation, dissimilar armor-grade steels (rolled homogenous armor (RHA) steels and ultra-high hard armor (UHA) steel) are welded using three electrodes, namely low hydrogen ferritic (LHF), austenitic stainless steel (ASS), and duplex stainless steel (DSS) by shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) process. All the three joints were tested against the 7.62 x 54 mm armor-piercing (AP) projectile. The projectile was wholly stopped at the Weld Metal (WM). Three modes of failures were observed in WM (1) wear debris (WD), (2) wear debris + continuous cracks (WDCC), and (3) fine wear debris + microcracks (FWDMC). The joint fabricated using ASS electrode with the level of failure of WDCC performs better than other joints with the lowest area density of 70 kg/m(2) due to the high energy absorption capability of the austenite phase and higher strain hardening properties. At the interface, the martensitic band (MB) increases the hardness and has a vital role in determining ballistic resistance. The impact toughness and ductility of the weld metal play a significant role in deciding the ballistic performance more than hardness and strength properties.

AB Thick plate of 5083 aluminum alloy with 8 mm, 20 mm and 30 mm thicknesses are joined by double-side GMAW method. The influence of plate thickness on the welding stability, weld bead formation, porosity formation, microstructure and mechanical properties are investigated and compared. The results reveal that, with the increase of plate thickness, the stability of GMAW process, weld bead formation of the welded joints and the results of bending tests are similar. In larger plate thickness, more welding passes resulting in more source of hydrogen, larger specific surface area caused by thinner droplet, and the high solidification rate synergistically contribute to easier formation of porosity. With the increasing of plate thickness, higher peak temperatures of thermal cycles can lead to larger grain size. Besides, lower density of second-phase particles and more porosity of welded joint in larger plate thickness result in lower strength.

AB Brazing with nickel-based filler metals under vacuum is frequently applied for joining metals in applications that require high resistance to mechanical loads, corrosive environments and elevated temperatures. However, melting-point depressant elements in the filler can lead to brittle phases in the brazing seam, affecting crack initiation and propagation. This study investigated cylindrical butt joints of metastable austenitic AISI 304L, brazed with NiCrSiB-based fillers containing iron and molybdenum. Tensile, fatigue and corrosion tests were applied to identify the most promising filler for subsequent corrosion fatigue experiments in a self-developed test chamber. Results in air showed that fatigue performance close to AISI 304L can be achieved, when problematic Kirkendall voids and athermal brittle phases are avoided. Corrosion fatigue tests in aqueous environments with varying sodium chloride concentrations and elevated temperatures revealed that cracked chromium-rich borides in the diffusion-affected zone act as microgalvanic elements, accelerating corrosion fatigue via hydrogen embrittlement. At 80 degrees C, these mechanisms became widespread, leading to multiple crack initiations across the steel surface and not just in the brazing seam. Hence, this study highlights the complex interplay of microstructure, cyclic loading, and environmental effects, offering key insights into the failure mechanisms of vacuumbrazed joints under combined mechanical and corrosive stresses.

AB Cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE), an enzyme associated with hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production, is an important endogenous regulator of inflammation. Jumonji domain-containing protein 3 (JMJD3) is implicated in the immune response and inflammation. Here, we investigated the potential contribution of JMJD3 to endogenous CSE-mediated inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Upregulated CSE and JMJD3 were identified in synovial fibroblasts (SFs) from RA patients as well as in the joints of arthritic mice. Knocking down CSE augmented inflammation in IL-1 beta-induced SFs by increasing JMJD3 expression. In addition, CSE-/- mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) developed severe joint inflammation and bone erosion. Conversely, overexpressing CSE inhibited JMJD3 expression by the transcription factor Sp-1 and was accompanied by reduced inflammation in IL-1 beta-treated SFs. Furthermore, JMJD3 silencing or the administration of the JMJD3 inhibitor GSK-J4 significantly decreased the inflammatory response in IL-1 beta-treated SFs, mainly by controlling the methylation status of H3K27me3 at the promoter of its target genes. GSK-J4 markedly attenuated the severity of arthritis in CIA mice. In conclusion, suppressing JMJD3 expression by the transcription factor Sp-1 is likely responsible for the ability of CSE to negatively modulate the inflammatory response and reduce the progression of RA.

AB Carbon fiber-reinforced plastic bonded joints with novel carbon nanotube (CNT) adhesive films were manufactured and tested under different aging conditions by varying the surfactant content added to enhance CNT dispersion. Single lap shear (SLS) tests were conducted in their initial state and after 1 and 2 months immersed in distilled water at 60 degrees C. In addition, their electrical response was measured in terms of the electrical resistance change through thickness. The lap shear strength showed an initial decrease due to plasticization of weak hydrogen bonds, and then a partial recovery due to secondary crosslinking. This plasticization effect was confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry analysis with a decrease in the glass transition temperature. The electrical response varied with aging conditions, showing a higher plasticity region in the 1-month SLS joints, and a sharper increase in the case of the non-aged and 2-month-aged samples; these changes were more prevalent with increasing surfactant content. By adjusting the measured electrical data to simple theoretical calculations, it was possible to establish the first estimation of damage accumulation, which was higher in the case of non-aged and 2-month-aged samples, due to the presence of more prevalent brittle mechanisms for the CNT-doped joints.

AB The application of carbon-fiber-reinforcedthermoplastic(CFRTP)/metalhybrid structures is a vital step for realizing the lightweight designconcepts in aerospace. However, the CFRTP/metal hybrid structuresare usually not reliable enough in practical applications due to thehigh differences in chemical and physical properties between thesetwo materials. The current work provides a bottom-up strategy of introducingheteroatoms into CFRTP/metal interfaces to reconstruct the interfacialchemical structures and thus manufacture high-reliability hybrid structures.Based on the principle of utmost using reaction sites at metal surfaces,the heteroatoms of oxygen and hydrogen are specially designed andintroduced to the CFRTP/A6061-T6 (6061) interfaces by simple and greenplasma polymerization. The introduced oxygen and hydrogen heteroatomsreact with the aluminum and oxygen of the oxidation film at 6061 surfacesto produce great interfacial Al-O covalencies and hydrogenbonds. The reconstructing interfacial chemical structures strengthenthe joint strength of CFRTP/6061 hybrid structures from 8.82 to 23.97MPa. Our heteroatom introduction strategy is expected to get a freshinsight into the interfacial design concept and has several importantimplications for the future application of high-reliability CFRTP/metalhybrid structures.

AB The effect of stress concentration on crack initiation and propagation during stress corrosion cracking of carbon steel in alternate wet and dry marine condition was studied by constant load tensile and microelectrochemical test. Results showed that the notch front does not crack but pitting occurs in the corrosion process under loadfree condition. Under the loading condition, the anodic dissolution (AD) near the notch gradually intensified, and this effect become severer with increasing load. The local environment of the load-induced rapid AD and hydrogen evolution (HE) can lead to crack initiation, indicating that the joint action of AD and HE is the main SCC mechanism.

AB Titanium-salalen complexes have recently solved a long-standing problem in homogeneous epoxidation catalysis by enabling the selective catalytic epoxidation of terminal, nonconjugated olefins with hydrogen peroxide. In this work, we disclose the mechanism of this intriguing catalyst system, based on XRD analyses, kinetic studies, and NMR elucidation of intermediate structures, complemented by DFT computations. Titanium-salalen catalysts are typically prepared/stored as bis-mu-oxo or mu-oxo-mu-peroxo dimers. Under reaction conditions, while the mu-oxo bridged catalyst dimers remain intact, the epoxidation occurs through an octahedral, yet altered, coordination geometry of the homochiral monomeric subunits. This catalytically active coordination mode is accessed by a slow pre-equilibrium, involving uptake of hydrogen peroxide, and subsequent rearrangement of the coordination sphere of the dinuclear complex. This configuration allows a three-pronged electrophilic activation of hydrogen peroxide, which enables oxygen transfer by the joint action of (i) the Lewis acidic titanium center, (ii) H-bond donation by the ligand's NH, and (iii) mu-chalcogen interaction with the ligand's pentafluorophenyl moieties. This efficient activation of H2O2 by a dinuclear site parallels recent findings on the active sites of the industrial heterogeneous titanium silicalite TS-1 catalyst.

AB The pathological mechanisms and treatments of osteoarthritis (OA) are critical topics in medical research. This paper reviews the regulatory mechanisms of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in OA and the therapeutic potential of H2S donors. The review highlights the importance of changes in the endogenous H2S pathway in OA development and systematically elaborates on the role of H2S as a third gaseous transmitter that regulates inflammation, oxidative stress, and pain associated with OA. It also explains how H2S can lessen bone and joint inflammation by inhibiting leukocyte adhesion and migration, reducing pro-inflammatory mediators, and impeding the activation of key inflammatory pathways such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Additionally, H2S is shown to mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and to modulate Nrf2, NF-kappa B, PI3K/Akt, and MAPK pathways, thereby decreasing oxidative stress-induced chondrocyte apoptosis. Moreover, H2S alleviates bone and joint pain through the activation of Kv7, K-ATP, and Nrf2/HO-1-NQO1 pathways. Recent developments have produced a variety of H2S donors, including sustained-release H2S donors, natural H2S donors, and synthetic H2S donors. Understanding the role of H2S in OA can lead to the discovery of new therapeutic targets, while innovative H2S donors offer promising new treatments for patients with OA.

AB Hydrogen peroxide, povidone-iodine, and chlorhexidine are antiseptics that are commonly added to irrigants to either prevent or treat infection. There are little clinical data available that demonstrate efficacy of adding antiseptics to irrigants in the treatment of periprosthetic joint infection after biofilm establishment. The objective of the study was to assess the bactericidal activity of the antiseptics on S. aureus planktonic and biofilm. For planktonic irrigation, S. aureus was exposed to different concentrations of antiseptics. S. aureus biofilm was developed by submerging a Kirschner wire into normalized bacteria and allowing it to grow for forty-eight hours. The Kirschner wire was then treated with irrigation solutions and plated for CFU analysis. Hydrogen peroxide, povidone-iodine, and chlorhexidine were bactericidal against planktonic bacteria with over a 3 log reduction (p < 0.0001). Unlike cefazolin, the antiseptics were not bactericidal (less than 3 log reduction) against biofilm bacteria but did have a statistical reduction in biofilm as compared to the initial time point (p < 0.0001). As compared to cefazolin treatment alone, the addition of hydrogen peroxide or povidone-iodine to cefazolin treatment only additionally reduced the biofilm burden by less than 1 log. The antiseptics demonstrated bactericidal properties with planktonic S. aureus; however, when used to irrigate S. aureus biofilms, these antiseptics were unable to decrease biofilm mass below a 3 log reduction, suggesting that S. aureus biofilm has a tolerance to antiseptics. This information should be considered when considering antibiotic tolerance in established S. aureus biofilm treatment.

AB The adsorption behavior of Pb(OH)(+) on the basal octahedral (001) surface of kaolinite has been investigated using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PBE) of density functional theory with periodic slab models, where the water environment was considered. The coordination geometry, coordination number, preferred adsorption position, and adsorption type were examined, with binding energy estimated. All the monodentate and bidentate complexes exhibited hemi-directed geometry with coordination numbers of 3-5. Site of "O-u" with "up" hydrogen was more favorable for monodentate complex than site of "O-l" with "lying" hydrogen. Monodentate complexation of "O-u" site with a high binding energy of -182.60 kJ center dot mol(-1) should be the most preferred adsorption mode, while bidentate complexation on "OuOl" site of single Al center was also probable. The stability of adsorption complex was found closely related to the hydrogen bonding interactions between surface O-l and H in aqua ligands of Pb(II). Mulliken population and density of states analyses showed that coupling of Pb 6p with the antibonding Pb 6s-O 2p states was the primary orbital interaction between Pb(II) and the surface oxygen. Hydrogen complexation occupied a much large proportion in the joint coordination structure of bidentate complex, where bonding state filling predominated for the Pb-O-I interaction.

AB In subsea oil and gas systems, microalloyed steel linepipes are welded to low alloy steel (e.g. 8630) forgings using dissimilar fillers, such as alloy 625. Post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) is necessary to temper the heat affected zone (HAZ) and relieve residual stresses. During PWHT, carbon diffuses from the forging into the weld, where it is able to form critical new phases while creating a carbon depleted region within the HAZ. Although the phases that form within the weld metal are well documented, the extent of carbon diffusion remained unexplored. To tackle the problem, a combined experimental and modelling approach has been adopted. DICTRA simulations were employed in calculation of elemental diffusion, while electron microscopy has been used to verify phase formation and the extent of carbon diffusion. The results reported herein indicate that it is possible to modify the susceptibility of these joints to hydrogen embrittlement.

Within step 1, the input biomass is converted employing a hydrothermal degradation without added catalyst or by homogeneous catalysis. Within step 2, the hydrogen accepting products of step 1, e.g., levulinic acid (LA) are upgraded by a heterogeneously catalyzed hydrogenation with hydrogen donor substances, e.g., formic acid (FA). As a result, components with an even lower oxygen content in comparison to step 1 products are formed; as an example, gamma-valerolactone (GVL) can be named. Therefore, the products are more stable and contained less oxygen as requested for a possible application as liquid fuel. As a hydrothermal process, FEBio@H2O is especially suitable for highly water-containing feedstock. The evaluation involves hydrothermal conversion tests with model substances, degradation of real biomasses, transfer hydrogenation or hydrogenation with hydrogen donor of model substances and real products of step 1, catalyst selection and further development, investigation of the influence of reactor design, the experimental test of the whole process chain, and process assessment.

AB The epoxy adhesive-galvanized steel adhesive structure has been widely used in various industrial fields, but achieving high bonding strength and corrosion resistance is a challenge. This study examined the impact of surface oxides on the interfacial bonding performance of two types of galvanized steel with Zn-Al or Zn-Al-Mg coatings. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed that the Zn-Al coating was covered by ZnO and Al2O3, while MgO was additionally found on the Zn-Al-Mg coating. Both coatings exhibited excellent adhesion in dry environments, but after 21 days of water soaking, the Zn-Al-Mg joint demonstrated better corrosion resistance than the Zn-Al joint. Numerical simulations revealed that metallic oxides of ZnO, Al2O3, and MgO had different adsorption preferences for the main components of the adhesive. The adhesion stress at the coating-adhesive interface was mainly due to hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions, and the theoretical adhesion stress of MgO adhesive system was higher than that of ZnO and Al2O3. The corrosion resistance of the Zn-Al-Mg adhesive interface was mainly due to the stronger corrosion resistance of the coating itself, and the lower water-related hydrogen bond content at the MgO adhesive interface. Understanding these bonding mechanisms can lead to the development of improved adhesive-galvanized steel structures with enhanced corrosion resistance.

AB The lack of self-recovery features and mechanical toughness has fundamentally limited the practical applications of ionic single-network hydrogels. Due to strong ionic interactions with Zr4+ cation crosslinkers, intramolecular crosslinking nodes are found to evolve via the folding of alginate segments, revolutionizing alginate hydrogels with substantial self-recovery capability and enhanced mechanical strength. Although being restricted by likecharge repulsion still, this new crosslinking mechanism triples the reachable tensile strain of alginate/polyacrylamide double-network hydrogels, and largely improves self-recovery efficiency. As the gold nanoparticles with adsorbed alginate segments are further introduced as nanoparticulate crosslinking joints, nanoparticle size and weight ratios emerge as new parameters of reached plateau modules and, thus, effective crosslinking density. The stretching-induced conformation alteration and stripping of adsorbed alginate segments are surprisingly associated with the detachment of capping ligands from gold nanoparticles instead of the cleavage of hydrogen bonding between ligands and alginates. As a result, the strong interactions between capping ligands and nanoparticles significantly stimulate the re-adsorption of stripped alginate segments on nanoparticles, leading to the extraordinary 90 % self-recovery of mechanical strength within 5 min with much promoted tensile strength and energy dissipation. For achieved self-recovery efficiency, adjustable partial destruction of intramolecular nodes and nanoparticulate crosslinking joints have been unveiled essential. Hence, new concepts regarding the evolution and partial destruction of newly identified crosslinking joints have been delivered, which together with disclosed influential factors, including the size and capping ligands of crosslinking joints, should stimulate innovative approaches to promote the use of ionic hydrogels.

AB Rapid detection technology of the carburization of Fe-Cr-Ni high-temperature heat-resistant alloys in the ethylene cracking furnace and the hydrogen conversion furnace is in great need to prevent industrial accident. This paper implemented the GMRI-I carburizing detector to test the degree of carburization of 25Cr35NiNb+ microalloy inlet tube and 35Cr45NiNb+ microalloy outlet tube of the ethylene cracking furnace after service as well as the reinforced joint made of UNS N08810 from the hydrogen-producing reformer. In conjunction with the results of the low-power acid corrosion test, a rapid detection method for the degree of carburization was proposed. Based on the experimental results of the carburizing detector and the laboratory test data, the carburization degree test curve of the above three alloys based on the magnetic field strength has been established. The detection accuracy was circa. 5% and the error was 610%, which is convenient for guiding the use and replacement of Fe-Cr-Ni high-temperature heat-resistant alloy materials for ethylene cracking furnace and hydrogen conversion furnace, thereby ensuring the safe and stable operation of the device.

AB Underground hydrogen energy storage (UHES) in lined rock caverns (LRCs) is a promising solution for mitigating the instability of clean energy generation. However, the hydrogen injection/extraction process may activate potential faults surrounding the caverns, jeopardizing the service safety of the lining structures. In this study, a novel polymeric sealing layer was developed and tested for UHES, to replace the traditional steel lining. A numerical model of fault activation was established to analyze the mechanical response of the lining structures under various parameters, such as injection/extraction operation parameters, fault characteristics, and concrete lining forms. Results show that the stress level of the concrete lining is directly related to the number of hydrogen injection/extraction cycles, fault angle, and magnitude, while it diminishes with increasing fault distance. The flexible joint fillers could disperse the circumferential stress and absorb energy continuously during fault activation, resulting in lower stress levels and damage to segmental concrete lining, compared with integral concrete lining. The sealing layer, protected by the concrete lining, experiences lower stress fluctuations during fault activation. Additionally, the results obtained show that a certain distance threshold for fault-induced damage to the concrete lining was identified, beyond which fault activation no longer triggers damage. The distance threshold was tentatively determined to be 20 m.

AB Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) in the heat affected zone (HAZ) of a stainless steel 308L-316L weld joint in primary water of pressurized water reactor was investigated. Stress corrosion crack growth in the HAZ was observed in off-normal primary water chemistry with dissolved oxygen, but not in normal primary water chemistry with dissolved hydrogen. This suggests that it is unlikely a stress corrosion crack propagating in the HAZ could reach the fusion boundary and penetrate into the weld metal under normal primary water chemistry conditions. Microstructure analysis of the crack tip suggests that the SCC follows the slip-oxidation mechanism. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The gamma-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (gamma-APS) and gamma-(2,3-epoxypropoxy) propyltrimethoxysilane (gamma-GPS) single or bilayer silane film was produced to improve the tensile property of laser-welded 304 stainless steel/CFRTP joint in this work. The bonding mechanism at joint interface was investigated through experiments as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Si-O-Fe covalent bonds were formed between steel and different silane films. Hydrogen bonds were induced at the interfaces of silane coating/polymer sides. The binding energy calculation results suggested that the binding between gamma-APS silane coupling agent and steel was more stable than that of gamma-GPS and steel. The binding energy of -3.37 eV between amino group in gamma-APS and carbonyl group in CFRTP was greater than the binding energy of -4.84 eV between epoxy group in gamma-GPS and amide group in CFRTP, which indicated stronger interaction was obtained between gamma-GPS and polymer compared to the interaction between gamma-APS and polymer. The bilayer silane coating could combine the dominant functional groups of silane monolayer film to obtain stable bonding on both metal side and CFRTP side. Moreover, compared with silane single film, longer silane oligomer molecular chain length was provided by bilayer silane film, resulting in more entanglement sites between silane film and CFRTP and the increased joint mechanical property. The steel/CFRTP hybrid joint reached maximum tensile shear strength of 17.2 MPa, which was further increased by 115.0% and 79.2% than that obtained by gamma-APS and gamma-GPS silane single coating, respectively.

AB We tested the influence of estrogen on coronary resistance regulation by modulating nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels in female rats. For this, estrogen levels were manipulated and the hearts were immediately excised and perfused at a constant flow using a Langendorff's apparatus. Higher estrogen levels were associated with a lower coronary resistance, increased nitric oxide bioavailability, and higher levels of H2O2. When oxide nitric synthase blockade by L-NAME was performed, no significant changes were found in coronary resistance of ovariectomized rats. Additionally, we found an inverse association between NO levels and catalase activity. Taken together, our data suggest that, in the absence of estrogen influence and, therefore, reduced NO bioavailability, coronary resistance regulation seems to be more dependent on the H2O2 that is maintained at low levels by increased catalase activity.

AB This paper addresses public acceptance of a proposed sub-regional, hydrogen-electric, aviation service reporting initial empirical evidence from the UK HEART project. The objective was to assess public acceptance of a wide range of service features, including hydrogen power, electric motors, and pilot assistance automation, in the context of an ongoing realisable commercial plan. Both qualitative and quantitative data collection instruments were leveraged, including focus groups and stakeholder interviews, as well as the questionnaire-based Scottish National survey, coupled with the advanced discrete-choice modelling of the data. The results from each method are presented, compared, and contrasted, focusing on the strength, reliability, and validity of the data to generate insights into public acceptance. The findings suggest that public concerns were tempered by an incomplete understanding of the technology but were interpretable in terms of key service elements. Respondents' concerns and opinions centred around hydrogen as a fuel, single-pilot automation, safety and security, disability and inclusion, environmental impact, and the perceived usefulness of novel service features such as terminal design, automation, and sustainability. The latter findings were interpreted under a joint framework of technology acceptance theory and the diffusion of innovation. From this, we drew key insights, which were presented alongside a discussion of the results.

AB Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory autoimmune disease that mainly erodes joints and surrounding tissues, and if it is not treated in time, it can cause joint deformities and loss of function. S-propargyl-cysteine (SPRC) is an excellent endogenous hydrogen sulfide donor which can relieve the symptoms of RA through the promotion of H2S release via the CSE/H2S pathway in vivo. However, the instant release of H2S in vivo could potentially limit its further clinical use. To solve this problem, in this study, a SPRC-loaded poly(lactic acid) (PLA) microsphere (SPRC@PLA) was prepared, which could release SPRC in vitro in a sustained manner, and further promote sustained in vivo H2S release. Furthermore, its therapeutical effect on RA in rats was also studied. A spherical-like SPRC@PLA was successfully prepared with a diameter of approximately 31.61 mu m, yielding rate of 50.66%, loading efficiency of 6.10% and encapsulation efficiency of 52.71%. The SPRC@PLA showed significant prolonged in vitro SPRC release, to 4 days, and additionally, an in vivo H2S release around 3 days could also be observed. In addition, a better therapeutical effect and prolonged administration interval toward RA rats was also observed in the SPRC@PLA group.

AB With the urbanization construction and the advancement of the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, urban energy systems are characterized by coupling multi-energy networks and a high pro-portion of renewable energy. Urban energy systems need to improve the quality of energy use, as well as to achieve energy conservation and emission reduction. Inter-seasonal heat technology has satisfactory engineering application prospects in promoting renewable energy consumption and the energy supply of urban multi-energy systems. Considering inter-seasonal heat storage and electric hydrogen production, a joint optimization method of planning and operation is proposed for the urban multi-energy flow system. First, the operation framework of inter-seasonal heat storage and electric hydrogen production system is established, which clarifies the energy flow of the urban multi-energy system. Secondly, aiming at the goals of minimizing the equipment's annual investment cost and the multi-energy system annual operation cost, combined with the time series period division method, a planning operation model has been established considering multi-objectives. Through case study, it is shown that the proposed model can promote the renewable energy consumption and reduce the operation cost of the whole system.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Reactive air brazing has been widely used in fabricating solid oxide fuel/electrolysis cell (SOFC/SOEC) stacks. However, the conventional Ag-CuO braze can lead to (I) over oxidation at the steel interconnect interface caused by its adverse reactions with the CuO and (II) many voids caused by the hydrogen-induced decomposition of CuO. The present work demonstrates that the Ag particle interlayer can be used to join yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolytes to AISI 441 interconnect in air instead of Ag-CuO braze. Reliable joining between YSZ and AISI 441 can be realized at 920 degrees C. A dense and thin oxide layer (~2 mu m) is formed at the AISI 441 interface. Additionally, an interatomic joining at the YSZ/Ag interface was observed by TEM. Obtained joints displayed a shear strength of ~86.1 MPa, 161% higher than that of the joints brazed by Ag-CuO braze (~33 MPa). After aging in reducing and oxidizing atmospheres (800 degrees C/300 h), joints remained tight and dense, indicating a better aging performance. This technique eliminates the CuO-induced issues, which may extend lifetimes for SOFC/SOEC stacks and other ceramic/metal joining applications.

AB To effectively improve the absorption capacity of the integrated energy system to clean energy, reduce the carbon emissions of the system, and improve the economic benefits of the system, this paper constructs a comprehensive energy system model that includes electricity to hydrogen and hydrogen to gas and introduces the carbon trading mechanism, the green certificate trading mechanism, and the response mechanism to the load demand. Set different scenarios for example analysis, and solve the model through the CPLEX solver. The results show that the operation strategy of the integrated energy system considering demand response under the carbon green certificate joint trading mechanism performs best, reducing the total cost of the system by 65.8% and the carbon emissions by 23.1%, which can provide a strong reference and guidance for the low-carbon economy operation of the integrated energy system.

AB In 2018, Mishik Airazatovich Kazaryan received the highest award of the International Association for Alternative Energy and Ecology Order of Antoine de Saint-Exupe = ry "For Improving the Quality of Life on the Planet of People" (IAAEE) on nominating the Award Committee of the Editorial Board of the International Scientific Journal for Alternative Energy and Ecology (ISJAEE). The award was given for his outstanding contribution to development of alternative energetics and ecology. M.A. Kazaryan's prominent contribution to the development of alternative energetics and ecology is based on his pioneering works in the field of development of methods for producing hydrogen as environmentally friendly safe fuel, as well as works in the field of processing organic compounds by various physical methods. As a part of joint research with colleagues from Lebedev Physical Institute of RAS (LPI), M.A. Kazaryan participated in creation of new methods for producing hydrogen from various chemical compounds. The method of conversion of liquid-phase compounds in plasma discharges under the influence of intensive ultrasonic cavitation occupies a special place. In the course of these works, it is shown that low-temperature plasma initiated in liquid-phase media in discharge between electrodes is able to effectively decompose hydrogen containing molecules of organic compounds and form gaseous products where the part of hydrogen is more than 90%. Estimations of energy efficiency calculated taking into account hydrogen combustion heat and initial substances, as well as electricity costs, showed an efficiency level of about 60-70% in depending on the composition of the starting mixture. Another notable contribution of M.A. Kazaryan to the development of alternative energetics was the work on the optimization and justification of technological and structural parameters of energy discharge devices based on high-voltage pulse-periodic discharge for creating a reactor for plasmachemical processing of polymer wastes into hydrogen and other valuable compounds.

AB The correlations of joint detection of 22 vaginal microbes with routine examination results of vaginal secretions and assisted reproductive outcomes were investigated. There were 37 samples with abnormal vaginal microecology in 107 vaginal secretion samples. The top 5 detection rates of microorganisms were Ureaplasma urealyticum (73.83%), Prevotella sp. (70.09%), Gardnerella vaginalis (53.27%), L. crispatus (52.34%) and L. inerts (51.40%). When the levels of Bacillus and hydrogen peroxide in vaginal secretions decreased or pH increased, the abnormal rates of vaginal microecology increased significantly (P < 0.01). The clinical pregnancy rate (53.66%, 22/41) in the women with normal vaginal microecology was higher than that (37.5%, 9/ 24) with abnormal vaginal microecology. In conclusions, the joint detection of 22 vaginal microbes can quickly and effectively determine whether the vaginal microecology is normal or not. The evaluation of vaginal microecology may be valuable in predicting the assisted reproductive outcomes of infertile women.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB In the fusion reactor advanced blanket concepts, considerable attention has always been directed towards the materials employed for the coolants/breeders because the blanket components will be exposed to a harsh environment, including neutron/gamma-ray irradiation and high-temperature tritium breeders. Multifunctional ceramic coatings have been studied to reduce hydrogen isotope permeation, electrical conductivity, and corrosion of structural materials. For the sustainable development of a liquid blanket system, the coatings require not only permeation reduction but also resistance to irradiation damage, which is invisible, accumulative, and can be able to unexpected failure within a short period. In this study, the synergistic corrosion mechanisms of Li-Pb compatibility for the blanket materials were investigated through Li-Pb exposure tests under gamma-ray irradiation. A liquid-phase method and a hot-isostatic pressing were applied for the formation of ceramic-iron joint coatings on the inner wall of a steel tube. In static and flowing Li-Pb exposure tests under gamma-ray irradiation, the joint coatings and multi-layer coatings indicated superior corrosion resistance.

AB Utility-scale renewable power-to-hydrogen (ReP2H) systems typically consist of multiple electrolyzers (ELZs), many of which are powered by thyristor rectifiers (TRs). A TR-powered ELZ has a nonlinear and nondecouplable relation between its active and reactive loads. The on-off switching and load allocation across multiple ELZs impact the efficiency of P2H energy conversion and the active and reactive power flows in the electrical network. Improper scheduling may result in an excessive reactive load from the hydrogen plant, causing voltage violations and increased network losses, which compromise both safety and profitability. To address these issues, this paper first explores the tradeoffs between the energy efficiency and reactive loads of ELZs. Then, we propose a joint active-reactive power management method to coordinate the loads and thermal properties of the ELZs, renewables, energy storage, and var compensation to improve the overall productivity and profitability. Mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) is established to achieve these goals, and a decomposition algorithm enables its applicability in large-scale systems. Case studies show that the proposed method, at best, increases the hydrogen yield by 2.49% while reducing network losses by 3.12% compared to the state-of-the-art strategies based on wind and solar power data from Inner Mongolia, China. The optimal var resource configuration for ReP2H systems is also briefly discussed.

AB When for steel liners of pressure tunnels and shafts high-strength steels are used, welded joints are subject to the risk of hydrogen induced cold-cracking in the base material. Longitudinal butt welded joints are critical regions as they are loaded transversely. For an accurate engineering fatigue and fracture assessment, solutions for stress intensity factors (SIF) are required, considering the weld shape and the global behavior of the liner (i.e., geometrical imperfections and interaction with surrounding concrete and rock). In this study, SIF for axial semi-elliptical surface cracks and embedded elliptical cracks at longitudinal butt welded joints of steel liners are studied by means of the finite element method. At first the applicability of published parametric equations for SIF of elliptical cracks in plates is validated. Then the influence of the weld shape is assessed through a systematic parametric study. It is shown that the weld profile has a significant influence on SIF for semi-elliptical surface cracks while it has no significant influence on SIF for embedded elliptical cracks within the studied range of relative crack depth. Finally, a new parametric equation is proposed to estimate the weld shape correction factor for semi-elliptical surface cracks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Two-dimensional direct numerical simulations of planar laminar premixed ammonia/hydrogen/air flames are conducted fora wide range of equivalence ratios, hydrogen (H2) fractions in the fuel blend, pressures, and unburned temperatures to study intrinsic flame instabilities (IFIs) in the linear regime. For stoichiometric and lean mixtures at ambient conditions, a non-monotonic behavior of thermo-diffusive instabilities with increasing H2 fraction is observed. Strongest instabilities occur for molar H2 fractions of 40%. The analysis shows that this behavior is linked to the joint effect of variations of the effective Lewis number and Zeldovich number. IFIs in ammonia/hydrogen blends further show a non-monotonic trend with respect to pressure, which is found to be linked to the chemistry of the hydroperoxyl radical HO2. The addition of NH3 opens new reaction pathways for the consumption of HO2 resulting in a chain carrying behavior in contrast to its chain terminating nature in pure H2/air flames. Theoretically derived dispersion relations can predict the non-monotonic behavior for lean conditions. However, these are found to be sensitive to the different methods for evaluating the Zeldovich number available in the literature. The novelty of this research is the systematic identification and explanation of a non-monotonic behavior of intrinsic flame instabilities IFIs in ammonia/hydrogen/air (NH3/H2/air) flames concerning the hydrogen content in the fuel and the pressure. To the author's knowledge, this study presents the largest parametric study for linear stability analyses of NH3/H2/air flames. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis to the Zeldovich number is proposed to link the macroscopic effect of IFIs to the microscopic effects of chemistry. In light of possible applications of NH3 as zero-carbon fuel, this study is significant because the fundamental understanding of IFIs in NH3/H2/air flames is key for the analysis and modeling of such flames.

AB In recent years, hydrogen-based multi-energy systems (HMESs) have received wide attention. However, existing works on the optimal operation of HMESs neglect building thermal dynamics, which means that the flexibility of thermal loads can not be utilized for reducing system operation cost. In this paper, we investigate an optimal operation problem of an HMES with the consideration of building thermal dynamics. Specifically, we first formulate an expected operational cost minimization problem related to an HMES. Due to the existence of uncertain parameters, inexplicit building thermal dynamics models, spatially and temporally coupled operational constraints, and nonlinear constraints, it is challenging to solve the formulated problem. Then, we propose an algorithm to solve the problem based on model-based optimization and data-driven based learning. The key idea of the proposed algorithm is summarized as follows: (1) transforming the long-term cost minimization problem into several single-slot subproblems using Lyapunov optimization techniques; (2) dividing each single-slot subproblem into two parts according to the availability of model information; (3) solving one part based on convex optimization and solving another part using multi-agent attention-based deep deterministic policy gradient. Simulation results based on real-world traces show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB A new method for joint processing of experimental data from various laboratories based on their approximation by the generalized Arrhenius law is proposed. The method is based on the construction of a system of functions that are orthogonal on a given set of points with arbitrary weights. As a result, the confidence intervals of the approximation coefficients can be estimated and the number of terms required for the approximation can be correctly determined. The performance of the method is demonstrated as applied to reactions of hydrogen combustion in air that are important at T < 1000 K. High accuracy of reaction rate approximation is achieved.

AB By applying the enzyme catalase, our study on hyaluronan degradation confirms the generation of hydrogen peroxide using the Weissberger biogenic oxidative system (WBOS), which is composed of ascorbate and cupric ions. Dynamic viscosities of hyaluronan (HA) solutions influenced by WBOS in the absence and presence of catalase were analysed by rotational viscometry. Molar masses of HAs were determined by size-exclusion chromatography with multi-angle laser-light scattering. Our results show that catalase dose-dependently inhibited the degradation of HA macromolecules, which presumably confirms the generation of H2O2 in the reaction system. This has implications in range of biomedical applications such as arthritic joint treatment, tissue engineering, ocular and cosmetic surgery. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The main intent of the current research was to appraise if combined application of hydrogen sulfide (H2S, 0.2 mM) and silicon (Si 2.0 mM) could improve tolerance of tomato plants to arsenic (As as sodium hydrogen arsenate heptahydrate, 0.2 mM) stress. Plant growth, chlorophylls (Chl), PSII maximum efficiency (Fv/Fm), H2S concentration and L-cysteine desulfhydrase activity were found to be suppressed, but leaf and root As, leaf proline content, phytochelatins, malondialdehyde (MDA) and H2O2 as well as the activity of lipoxygenase (LOX) increased under As stress. H2S and Si supplied together or alone enhanced the concentrations of key antioxidant biomolecules such as ascorbic acid, and reduced glutathione and the activities of key antioxidant system enzymes including catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione S-transferase (GST). In comparison with individual application of H2S or Si, the joint supplementation of both had better effect in improving growth and key biochemical processes, and reducing tissue As content, suggesting a putative collaborative role of both molecules in improving tolerance to As-toxicity in tomato plants.

AB Joint disorders seriously affect daily life. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a type of chronic autoimmune disorder, causes recession for range of motion (ROM) and joint function loss. Monitoring and recording ROM is regarded as an efficient way for assisting in RA diagnosis at an early stage. Here, a multi-function hydrogel-based sensor was developed to monitor RA motion. With an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) structure was prepared from self-crosslinked the poly (N-Hydroxyethyl acrylamide-co-Acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid) (PHA) network with conductive polymers PEDOT:PSS and Zinc ions, this conductive hydrogel (PHAC) was able to achieve stretchable, sensitive, adhesive and anti-bacterial properties. The hydrogen bonding and ion interaction present in hydrogel network enable PHAC with high stretchable (similar to 5000 % strain), strong adhesion to connection (61.4 kPa on copper), high conductivity (208.96 mS.cm(-1)), fast self-healing (recovery to 40 % stretchable properties in 10 min) and excellent anti-bacterial behavior. After combining this sensor element with customized printed circuit board (PCB) and detachable battery, the RA monitor system demonstrated the real-time recording, accurate detection of ROM, and long-time stability of signal transmission. This line of research work sheds light on stretchable, sensitive, adhesive, self-healable, anti-bacterial and wireless soft sensors with potential applications in human joint monitoring, personal healthcare diagnosis, and soft robots.

AB Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease and the leading cause of disability in elderly individuals. Despite rapid advances in imaging techniques, early OA diagnosis remains a clinical challenge. In the present study, the feasibility of early OA diagnosis was explored via near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined with aquaphotomics. Synovial fluid samples from 65 cases of OA categorized as mild, moderate, and severe according to the Kellgren and Lawrence classification criteria were analyzed via NIRS. The 1st overtone of water (1300-1600 nm) was considered as the research object for an aquaphotomics model, and aquagrams of the mild, moderate, and severe OA cases were generated using 12 water absorption patterns for early OA diagnosis.The aquaphotomics results exhibited clear differences in the region of 1300-1500 nm, and the number of hydrogen bonds of different water species (1412,1424, 1482, and 1496 nm) evidently correlated with OA occurrence and development. With OA progression, the absorption intensity of water molecules without hydrogen bonds (1412 nm/1424 nm) became stronger, while the absorption intensity of water molecules with four hydrogen bonds (1482 nm/1496 nm) decreased.These results together reveal that the established accurate and rapid early OA diagnosis model based on NIRS combined with aquaphotomics is effective and feasible, and that the number of hydrogen bonds can be used as a biomarker for early OA diagnosis.

SO RSC ADVANCES

DT Article
AB Ionogels have attracted tremendous interest for flexible electronics due to their excellent deformability, conductivity, and environmental stability. However, most ionogels suffer from low strength and poor toughness, which limit their practical applications. This article presents a strategy for fabricating ionogels with high toughness by constructing high-density hydrogen bonds within their microstructure. The ionogels exhibit a maximum fracture strength of 11.44 MPa, and can sustain a fracture strain of 506%. They also demonstrate a fracture energy of 27.29 MJ m-3 and offer a wide range of mechanical property adjustments (fracture stress from 0.3 to 11.44 MPa, fracture strain from 506% to 1050%). Strain sensors assembled with ionogels demonstrate exceptional sensing performance and enable motion detection of human joints. This study provides a new approach for achieving strong and tough ionogel design used for high-performance flexible electronic applications.
   In this paper, ionogels with high mechanical properties were prepared by constructing a high-density hydrogen bond crosslinking network. The ionogel also has excellent transparency, environmental stability, adhesion and shape memory ability.

AB Conductive hydrogel-based epidermal strain sensors can generate repeatable electrical changes upon mechanical deformations for indication of the skin's physiological condition. However, this remains challenging for many conductive hydrogel sensors due to biomechanical mismatch with skin tissues and an unstable resistance variation response, resulting in non-conformable deformations with the epidermis and dermis, and consequently generating inaccurate monitoring of human movements. Herein, a conductive hydrogel that highly matches the skin is fabricated from dynamically hydrogen-bonded nanocrystallites of polydopamine-modified reduced graphene oxide (PDA-rGO) nanosheets composited with polyvinyl alcohol, namely the PDA-rGO/PVA hydrogel. PDA-rGO provides a large number of dynamic hydrogen-bonding interactions in the hydrogel, resulting in a skin-matching modulus (78 kPa) and stretchability. Moreover, the resultant hydrogel possesses excellent cytocompatibility and conductivity (0.87 S m(-1)), high sensitivity (gauge factor of compression: 20) at low strain and outstanding linearity at high strain as well as a stable resistance variation response. These desirable properties enable the application of the PDA-rGO/PVA hydrogel as a skin-friendly wearable sensor for real-time and accurate detection of both large-scale joint movements and tiny physiological signals, including the bending and relaxing of fingers, the wrist, elbow and knee joints, and wrist pulse and swallowing. Moreover, this hydrogel is integrated into a 2D sensor array that monitors strains or pressures in two dimensions, which is promising for electronic skin, biosensors, human-machine interfaces, and wearable electronic devices.

AB A joint theoretical and experimental study is reported to systematically explore over a library of transition metal-silicon intermetallics for understanding silicon-controlled active site motifs and discovering hydrogen-evolving electrocatalysts. On the one hand, every low-index surface termination of 115 transition metal (M)-silicon (Si) intermetallics is enumerated, followed by cataloging of stable adsorption sites and prediction of catalytic activities on the main exposed facets. It is theoretically found that silicon atoms in silicon-rich structures (especially MSi2 and MSi) show a strong site-isolating effect, which can eliminate M-M-M hollow and M-M bridge sites with too strong hydrogen-binding ability and thereby provide great opportunities for the exposure of novel highly active sites (e.g., M-top and Si-related sites). On the other hand, solid-state redox reactions are developed to synthesize a set of 24 silicides containing 5 MSi, 13 MSi2, and 6 others, most of which are phase-pure samples. The experimental studies demonstrate that too rich silicon content in silicides (e.g., MSi2) leads to adverse effects, such as the formation of amorphous SiOx layers on the silicide surface, masking the presence of active sites during electrocatalysis. Finally, 5 MSi (M = Rh, Pd, Pt, Ru, Ir) as highly active hydrogen-evolving electrocatalysts are identified.

AB The compound 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (6-MHO) is a product of skin oil ozonolysis and is of significance in understanding the role of human occupants in the indoor environment. We present a joint computational and experimental study investigating the adsorption of 6-MHO on two model indoor relevant surfaces, SiO2, a model for a glass window, and TiO2, a component of paint and self-cleaning surfaces. Our classical force field-based molecular dynamics, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and FTIR absorption spectra indicate 6-MHO can adsorb on to both of these surfaces via hydrogen and pi-hydrogen bonds and is quite stable due to the linear geometry of 6-MHO. Detailed analysis of 6-MHO on the SiO2 surface shows that relative humidity does not impact surface adsorption and adsorbed water does not displace 6-MHO from the hydroxylated SiO2 surface. Additionally, the desorption kinetics of 6-MHO from the hydroxylated SiO2 surface is compared to other compounds found in indoor environments and 6-MHO is shown to desorb with a first order rate constant that is approximately four times slower than that of limonene, but six times faster than that of carvone. In addition, our joint results indicate 6-MHO forms a stronger interaction with the TiO2 surface compared to the SiO2 surface. This study suggests that skin oil ozonolysis products can partition to indoor surfaces leading to the formation of organic films.

AB Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is an age-related progressive degenerative joint disease, which is featured with pain, joint deformity, and disability. Accumulating evidence indicated oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the occurrence and development of KOA. Curcumin is a polyphenolic compound with significant antioxidant activity among various diseases while catalase (CAT) is an enzyme degrading hydrogen peroxide in treating oxidative diseases. We previously showed that the expression of CAT was low in cartilage. However, the combination of curcumin and CAT in KOA is still elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that the combination of curcumin and CAT has the potential to inhibit the IL1 beta-induced chondrocyte apoptosis without cytotoxicity in vitro. Mechanistically, we found that the synergistic application curcumin and CAT not only promotes curcumin's regulation of the NRF2/HO-1 signaling pathway to enhance antioxidant enzyme expression to remove superoxide radicals, but also CAT can further remove downstream hydrogen peroxide which enhances the ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS). In vivo, studies revealed that combination of curcumin and catalase could better inhibit oxidative stress-induced chondrocyte injury by promoting the expression of ROS scavenging enzymes. In sum, the combination of curcumin and catalase can be used to treat KOA. Thus, combination of curcumin and catalase may act as a novel therapeutic agent to manage KOA and our research gives a rationale for their combined use in the therapeutic of KOA.

AB To effectively improve the absorption capacity of the integrated energy system (IES) to clean energy, reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of the system, and improve the economic benefits of the system, this paper constructs a comprehensive energy system model that includes both electricity to hydrogen and hydrogen to gas and introduces the carbon dioxide trading mechanism, the green certificate trading mechanism and the response mechanism to the load demand. Different scenarios are set for example analysis and the model is solved using Matlab software's CPLEX solver. The results show that the operation strategy of the IES considering demand response under the carbon dioxide-green certificate joint trading mechanism performs best, reducing the total cost of the system by 65.8% and the carbon dioxide emissions by 23.1%, which can provide a strong reference and guidance for the low carbon dioxide economy operation of the IES.

ID MECHANISM
AB The plates of die cast AZ91D magnesium alloy were welded by gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) with the filler metal of extruded AZ61 as well as AZ61 containing mixed rare earth elements and no filler metal. The porosity in the weldment and the chemical composition of the weld joints were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The results indicate that: there were many micropores and macropores around the fusion line in all welded specimens, and it is proposed that the former were mainly induced by hydrogen, while the latter were inherited from the porosity that were mainly nitrogen preexisting in the base metal. The amount of porosity in the weldment welded with AZ61 wire was less than that without filler metal, and the size of large pores was also decreased, which was the effect of dilution due to less gas inclusions in the filler material. A further decrease of the porosity was observed in the joint using filler wire AZ61 containing rare earths, and the probable mechanisms are following. On the one hand, the rare earth elements reduced effectively the hydrogen-induced porosity by increasing the solid solubility of H in the magnesium alloy, reacting with H to form hydrides and accelerating the escape velocity of bubbles. On the other hand, the porosity that resulted from N-2 was decreased to some extent too because the rare earths accelerated the overflow velocity of bubbles.

AB Developing visible light-responding photoelectrocatalysts with higher efficiency is highly demanded and broadly concerned in terms of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Here, we report that by constructing a TiO2/CuInS(2 )p-n junction and further decorating it with plasmonic Cu nanoparticles, the synthesized TiO2/CuInS2/Cu photoanodes show significantly enhanced visible light absorption and higher photoelectrocatalysis efficiency, benefiting from the joint influence of the built-in electric field and surface plasmonic resonance (SPR). Under > 420 nm light irradiation, the photocurrent density is 2.36 mA/ cm2 at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), enhanced by about 10 times than that of pure TiO2. Furthermore, the hydrogen production rate was enhanced from an undetectable level to 4.552 mu mol/cm(2)/h. Our results exhibit that the strategy of a double-layer co-catalyst has promising applications in water splitting and other solar energy-conversion areas.

AB Alternative approaches to replace total joint replacement are desirable to reduce the massive loss of healthy tissues. The tribological performance of the cartilage-diamond contact in deionized water and calf bovine serum environments was investigated in this study. To optimize lubrication, hydrogen and ammonia treatments were applied on diamond surfaces. Adhesion and wettability on the same were evaluated to determine the impact of functionalization on surface properties. It was found that the friction between the cartilage and diamond decreased with an increase in the load. This is related to the interaction between two contacting surfaces. Under dry conditions, the hydrogen treatment enabled a reduction in friction while the ammonia treatment increased it. The lubricated friction, however, is determined by two effects: the surface area covered by the lubricant and their interactions. Our results show that the microcrystalline diamond without functionalization provided the lowest friction (coefficient of 0.02-0.03) while sliding against cartilage in serum. The reason is that microcrystalline diamond attracts more molecules that dominate the lubricating performance. This research demonstrated that diamond materials could be suitable as implants as well as to locally repair them. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The uncertainty of renewable energy undermines the competitiveness of Renewable Energy Generation Companies (REGC) in market bidding. Hydrogen energy storage, as a novel high-energy-density energy storage technology, is considered an ideal solution to address the uncertainty of renewable energy and provide flexible ramping products (FRP) to the grid. Building upon this, this paper combines hydrogen energy storage and renewable energy to build a hydrogen-wind-photovoltaic (HWP) system, and introduces HWP into the flexible ramping market for the first time, while participating in the energy market. To capture the interactions between HWP and market players with different utility functions, this paper establishes a bi-level bidding strategy model for HWP participation in the integrated energy and flexible ramping markets, It enables HWP to optimize its internal unit output to increase revenue based on current market conditions. In addition to this, the uncertainty of renewable energy output is taken into account in the upper-level model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage stochastic bi-level optimization scheduling model was validated on IEEE 6-bus and 36-bus transmission-constrained networks. Tests demonstrated that the proposed model effectively assists HWP in formulating optimal bidding strategies in the joint market under uncertainty. Compared to solely participating in a single energy market, HWP's simultaneous participation in energy and flexible ramping markets increased total revenue by 12.22%.

AB This paper proposes a novel problem called the time-dependent hydrogen fuel cell vehicle routing problem with drones and variable drone speeds (TDHFCVRP-D-VDS). In this problem, a fleet of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) are equipped with multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to perform delivery and pickup services within the customers' time windows. The UAV is capable of performing pickup operations after the delivery service, as long as it does not exceed its energy capacity. The HFCV can launch and retrieve the UAV multiple times as needed throughout the routing process. We establish a mixed integer programming model to simultaneously minimize the total cost and makespan, and verify its accuracy by Gurobi. To tackle larger-scale instances, we propose a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III with intelligent selection (NSGA-III-IS). The initial population is generated using four distinct approaches aimed at enhancing both diversity and quality. Considering the customers' time windows, we factor in the temporal-spatial distances between customers when generating the initial population. Our approach employs a two-phase algorithm for developing initial solutions. In the first phase, the algorithm focuses on generating UAV trips, while in the second phase, it creates joint delivery routes for both the HFCV and the UAV. To enhance the optimization process, we have developed four strategies for optimizing UAV speed. These strategies dynamically adjust the UAV's speed in response to the customers' time windows and the HFCVs' arrival times. Additionally, we have integrated an intelligent selection mechanism to optimize the execution probabilities of both general and problem-specific operators. The experimental results demonstrate the following: (1) The proposed NSGA-III-IS outperforms other variant algorithms and two benchmark algorithms; (2) UAVs significantly benefit from variable flight speeds, resulting in reduced costs and improved efficiency; (3) The HFCV with UAV joint delivery pattern is superior for reducing carbon emissions compared to other joint delivery patterns; (4) Longer customer time windows and optimized UAV speed strategies are effective in reducing the total cost, makespan, and total UAV hover waiting time; (5) Finally, a method that combines multi-attribute decision-making with principal component analysis is utilized to aid decision-makers in selecting satisfactory solutions.

AB Hydrogen has the highest gravimetric density (energy density per unit mass) of any fuel. The combustion of hydrogen releases energy in the form of heat. When hydrogen reacts with oxygen in a fuel cell, the reaction releases energy in the form of electricity. Unlike hydrocarbon-based fuels, the generation of energy from either the combustion of hydrogen or the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell is not accompanied by the emission of greenhouse gases. This makes hydrogen a promising solution to solve global warming issues. However, hydrogen has a low volumetric density (low energy density per unit volume) which makes storing or transporting hydrogen extremely difficult and expensive. To accelerate the utilization of hydrogen as an energy carrier, it is necessary to develop advanced hydrogen storage methods that have the potential to have a higher energy density. The hydrogen storage market is segmented by application into: (1) Stationary power: stored hydrogen is consumed for example in a fuel cell for use in backup power stations, refueling stations, power stations; (2) Portable power: hydrogen storage applications for electronic devices such as mobile phones, flash lights, and portable generators; and (3) Transportation: industries including automobiles, aerospace, unmanned aerial systems, and hydrogen tanks used throughout the hydrogen supply chain. The increasing devel-opment of light and heavy fuel cell vehicles is expected to drive the development of on-board solid-state hydrogen technologies. A large number of research groups worldwide for many years have been trying to develop materials having the right set of thermodynamic and kinetic properties, along with all of the physical properties (high gravimetric density, high volumetric density, etc.) to allow for low-pressure storage system in ambient conditions. However, to date, no material has been found that satisfies all the desired properties to be viably used in many appli-cations. Even if we consider only three parameters namely gravimetric density, volumetric density, and system cost, no materials that can meet the ultimate targets of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) or the 2030 targets of the European Union's Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU) and the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) in Japan. The present article reviews advances in solid-state hydrogen storage technology and compares the opportunities and challenges of selected materials. The materials reviewed in this article have a wider spectrum than the materials reviewed in other existing articles, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs), metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), graphene, boron nitride (BN), fullerene, silicon, amorphous manganese hydride molecular sieve, and metal hydrides. Pioneering works, important breakthroughs, as well as the latest developments for promising materials are also reviewed. In addition, for the first time the targets set by several official regulatory agencies for solid-state hydrogen storage are summarized. Achievements in academic and industrial research are compared against these targets. The future prospects of promising materials are analyzed based on how its practical application can be implemented according to market needs. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB Surface pretreatment is of great significance for improving the welding quality of metal materials, especially aluminum alloys. At present, the welding process is introduced to join the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) AlSi10Mg alloys or their repair during manufacturing or service. However, the high susceptibility of hydrogen pores is one of the most important problems encountered in the fusion welding process of LPBF AlSi10Mg alloys. To clarify the influence of the surface state of the base metal on the hydrogen pore characteristics, the LPBF AlSi10Mg sheets were pretreated by chemical cleaning treatment (CCT), mechanical polishing treatment (MPT), and chemical cleaning treatment after mechanical polishing treatment (MPT-CCT) before laser welding. Subsequently, the hydrogen pore characteristics, microstructure, and micro-hardness of the welded joints were investigated. The experimental results show that laser welding with MPT-CCT significantly reduces the porosity and pore diameter. In addition, MPT-CCT can eliminate most of the broken and discontinuous surface oxide film and Mg enrichment. In summary, the necessity of MPT-CCT for LPBF AlSi10Mg alloys is analyzed systematically, which is of great significance to improve the welding quality.

AB Background: Native and periprosthetic joint infections are devastating conditions fraught with patient morbidity and mortality. Aseptic and septic joints are often debrided and irrigated to decrease bacterial loads when preventing or treating infection. However, the effect of clinically used irrigation solutions on the native cellular components of the synovial joint is unknown. Methods: Patients consented, and their suprapatellar knee tissue was surgically excised for fibroblast isolation. Cultured knee fibroblasts were treated with normal saline for three minutes or one of the following experimental solutions: acetic acid, chlorhexidine-gluconate, Dakin's solution, hydrogen peroxide, or povidone-iodine. The exposure time for the antiseptic solutions was one and three minutes. At 24 hours after irrigation treatment, metabolic activity was measured via MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] activity assay, and deoxyribonucleic acid content was assessed by Hoechst staining as a surrogate for cell number. Phase-contrast imaging elucidated proliferation potential, progressive cell loss, and cell morphology over a 5-day period. All experiments were repeated in triplicate. Results: All experimental antiseptic irrigation solutions, regardless of application time, caused a significant reduction in metabolic activity and DNA content, indicating extensive cell death. Phase-contrast imaging showed halted cellular proliferation, progressive cell loss, and distinct changes in cellular morphology, indicating decreased cellular viability and progressive cell death. Conclusions: All antiseptic irrigation solutions investigated in this study were severely cytotoxic to human knee fibroblasts regardless of their chemical composition. The concentrations of these solutions are commonly used in orthopaedic surgery. Although these solutions have high bactericidal properties, it may be beneficial to use them in combination at lower doses to retain their effect on bacteria while remaining benign to native synovial cells.

TI Investigating the impact of roller position on pressure tube-end fitting
   rolled joint performance using 3D explicit finite element analysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESSURE VESSELS AND PIPING
LA English
DT Article
ID DELAYED HYDRIDE CRACKING; ZIRCONIUM ALLOYS
AB Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) utilize Zr-2.5 Nb pressure tubes that are connected to SS-403 end fittings through rolled joints. These rolled joints are made using a rolling tool equipped with five rollers and a tapered mandrel. The action of the rollers induces plastic deformation on the inner surface of the tube. The tapered mandrel promotes rotation and axial advancement of the rollers into the pressure tube through friction. However, prolonged usage of this rolling tool can lead to the wearing down of both the mandrel and the rollers. Consequently, this wear and tear can cause the rollers to deviate from their intended position within the rolled joint. Such misalignment can lead to excessive rolling of the pressure tube into the entry taper section of the end fitting. This, in turn, generates higher residual stresses than initially anticipated. This issue may also arise from accumulated tolerances within the rolling tool or positioning errors made by operators during the rolling operation. The overextension of the rollers can significantly increase tensile residual stresses within the pressure tube, and management of these stresses is critical to prevent failure of the pressure tube due to Delayed Hydrogen Cracking.The primary objective of the present investigation is to explore the effects of the overextension of rollers on the residual tensile stresses in the transition region of the rolled joint. This objective is achieved by employing a three-dimensional explicit finite element analysis methodology. In order to ensure the reliability and authenticity of the finite element model, the computational results are cross-validated with the experimental findings documented in the existing literature. The current investigation involves the examination of two distinct configurations of pressure tube to end fitting rolled joints, which are typically found in PHWRs. The results of the present inquiry reveal an optimal roller position that minimizes residual tensile stresses within the transition region of a rolled joint. Furthermore, it is observed that any deviations in the roller position within a range of 5 mm, beyond the optimal position, result in a negligible increase in residual tensile stress.

   calandria vessel during severe accident
SO NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN
LA English
DT Article
AB In case of Indian Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs), in-calandria retention of corium is essential for mitigating core melt down accident. Benchmark calculations have shown that if corium breaches the calandria vessel and enters the calandria vault, large amount of hydrogen and other fission gases may be generated due to molten corium concrete interaction (MCCI). There is possibility of containment failure. Hence, the best option is to contain the corium inside the calandria vessel and cool it from outside by calandria vault water. PHWR calandria vessel thicknesses varies from 22 mm to 32 mm and have weld joints due to the steps involved. It is true that smaller calandria vessel thickness has lower temperature gradient and may promote higher heat transfer rate. However, there is an international concern about the healthiness of the thin vessel with stepped weld joints due to the thermal loading of high temperature corium melt which can lead to excessive thermal strain of vessel and weld joints and it may result in failure before the corium stabilization inside the vessel is achieved. In the present study, experiments were conducted in a scaled facility of an Indian PHWR to investigate the thermo-mechanical behaviour of simulated stepped calandria vessel with weld joints. The temperature distributions and the strain contours of vessel were recorded. Numerical analysis was carried out to validate the FEM model with the test data and also analysis was extended to predict the thermo mechanical behaviour of prototypic stepped calandria vessel.

AB Hydrogen process equipment are often housed in 20-foot or 40-foot container either be at refueling stations or at the portable standalone power generation units. Shipping Container provide an easy to install, cost effective, all weather protective containment. Hydrogen has unique physical properties, it can quickly form an ignitable cloud for any accidental release or leakages in air, due to its wide flammability limits. Identifying the hazards associated with these kind of container applications are very crucial for design and safe operation of the container hydrogen installations. Recently both numerical studies and experiment have been performed to ascertain the level of hazards and its possible mitigation methods for hydrogen applications. This paper presents the numerical modelling and the simulations performed using the HyFOAM CFD solver for vented deflagrations processes. HyFOAM solver is developed in-house using the open source CFD toolkit OpenFOAM libraries. The turbulent flame deflagrations are modelled using the flame wrinkling combustion model. This combustion model is further improved to account for flame instabilities dominant role in vented lean hydrogen-air mixtures deflagrations. The 20-foot ISO containers of dimensions 20' x 8' x 8'.6 '' filled with homogeneous mixture of hydrogen-air at different concentration, with and without model obstacles are considered for numerical simulations. The numerical predictions are first validated against the recent experiments carried out by Gexcon as part of the HySEA project supported by the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking (FCH 2 JU) under the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. The effects of congestion within the containers on the generated overpressures are investigated. The preliminary CFD predictions indicated that the container walls deflections are having considerable effect on the trends of generated overpressures, especially the peak negative pressure generated within the container is overestimated. Hence to account for the container wall deflections, the fluid structure interactions (FSI) are also included in the numerical modelling. The final numerical predictions are presented with and without the FSI. The FSI modelling considerably improved the numerical prediction and resulted in better match of overpressure trends with the experimental results. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB The dynamics of the Universe is analyzed using an exponential function for the dark energy equation of state, known as Gong-Zhang parameterization. The phase space of the free parameters presented in the model is constrained using Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, Cosmic Chronometers, modulus distance from Hydrogen II Galaxies, Type Ia Supernovae and measurements from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, together with a stronger bound from a Joint analysis. The cosmological model is confronted with ?CDM, observing there is a strong evidence for ?CDM in the Joint analysis although the exponential model is preferred when the data are separated. Based on the Joint analysis, a value of omega 0 = -1.202+0.027 -0.026 is found for the characteristic parameter presented in the equation of state. Additionally, the cosmographic parameters at current times are reported, having q0 = -0.789+0.034 -0.036, j0 = 1.779+0.130 -0.119, and a transition deceleration-acceleration redshift zT = 0.644+0.011 -0.012. Furthermore, the age of the Universe is estimated as tU = 13.788+0.019 -0.019 Gyrs. Finally, we open a discussion if this model could alleviate the H0 and S8 tensions.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The 5B70 aluminum alloy holds broad application prospects in the aerospace industry, yet welding thick aluminum alloys encounters challenges such as porosity, weld formation issues, and coarse grain. In this study, 20 mm thick 5B70 aluminum alloy plates were joined using electron beam welding with oscillation and wire feeding techniques. The effect of oscillation amplitude on weld formation, porosity, grain structure, and mechanical properties of the joints was comprehensively investigated. From the cross-sectional morphologies of the joints, it is evident that porosity defects are distributed throughout the weld, which could be distinguished into metallurgical and process types, with characteristics influenced by hydrogen evolution and keyhole instability, respectively. Oscillation notably improved weld formation, practically eliminating the reinforcement height and porosity at an amplitude of 1 mm. Additionally, oscillation facilitated melt pool stirring, leading to a reduction in internal dislocation density and a refinement of grain size from 5.6 to 4.5 mu m. This process significantly enhanced the mechanical performance of the joints, with ultimate tensile strength reaching up to 352.2 +/- 25 MPa through the reduction of porosity and grain size, demonstrating the potential of combining oscillation and wire feeding techniques in electron beam welding of thick aluminum alloy for improved weld quality.

AB High selectivity of cyclic-nucleotide binding (CNB) domains for cAMP and cGMP are required for segregating signaling pathways; however, the mechanism of selectivity remains unclear. To investigate the mechanism of high selectivity in cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), we determined a room-temperature joint X-ray/neutron (XN) structure of PKG I beta CNB-B, a domain 200-fold selective for cGMP over cAMP, bound to cGMP (2.2 angstrom), and a low-temperature X-ray structure of CNB-B with cAMP (1.3 angstrom). The XN structure directly describes the hydrogen bonding interactions that modulate high selectivity for cGMP, while the structure with cAMP reveals that all these contacts are disrupted, explaining its low affinity for cAMP.

AB Precisely modulating both the fine structures and exciton behaviors of covalent organic framework (COF)-based photocatalysts for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is still a great challenge. Herein, we report two COFs, fluorenone-based COF (FOO-COF) and fluorenyl-based COF (FO-COF), for photocatalytic H2 evolution. The results demonstrated that FOO-COF achieved a remarkable stability and hydrogen evolution rate of 119.1 mmol/h/g, surpassing those of many previously reported COF-based photocatalysts, thus resulting in an apparent quantum efficiency up to 20.5% at 435 nm. The joint observations from temperature-dependent photoluminescence, the delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence spectroscopy confirm that FOO-COF shows a stronger carrier separation and migration ability, much lower exciton binding energy, and faster dissociation speed of singlet and triplet excitons than FO-COF. More importantly, the femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectra (fs-TAS) revealed the great difference between the two COFs in electron trapping and exciton dissociation after Pt loading. Furthermore, theoretical calculations unveiled the feasibility of C=O groups in the LUMO sites of FOO-COF as active electronic centers for anchoring the photodeposited Pt cocatalysts, due to its much lower Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption and more negative charge density. We believe that the introduction of C=O groups in the FOO-COF can act as both a dominant electronic collection center and partial active sites, which improve the D-A polarizability and boost the generation, separation, migration, and utilization of photogenerated carriers in the FOO-COF for achieving remarkable photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The insights into the molecular-level mechanism in this work may guide the significance of the rational design of COF structures for advanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

AB Driven by lightweight requirements in the low-altitude economy, a synergistic laser ablation-silane coupling process was developed to optimize friction stir welded joints between Al alloys and carbon fiber-reinforced thermoplastics (CFRTPs), with a focus on elucidating the sequence-dependent gradient interfacial joining mechanism. A sequence involving silane coupling prior to laser ablation was employed, enabling dual-mode enhancement of the interfacial geometric configuration and chemical bonding. Mechanical interlocking was ensured in laser-ablated zones, whereas the chemical bonding capacity in unablated regions was enhanced. The tensile-shear strength and cross-tension strength of the joints were measured at 32.6 MPa and 3.2 MPa, respectively. Detailed microstructural characterization revealed that mechanical interlocking occurred in the laser-ablated zones of the PA66 resin and that synergistic physicochemical reinforcement was achieved via covalent Al-O-Si bonds coupled with molecular chain entanglement/hydrogen bonding in unablated regions. Defect-free continuous interfacial transitions were confirmed through the penetration of nanolamellar structures by amorphous silane films. This synergistic strategy provides new insights for the high-performance joining of dissimilar metal and polymer materials.

AB Strong single lap bonded joints of different materials are of great importance in various advanced industries. Silicones are commonly used as reliable adhesives for this purpose. Although silicones offer excellent properties such as resistance to extreme temperatures and weather conditions, as well as flexibility, their low surface energy limits their application as adhesives. To address this issue, we added a hydrogen-containing silicone adhesion promoter to an addition-curing silicone adhesive. We also introduced functional groups on the aluminum and glass adherends through air plasma (AP) surface treatment. These modifications were made to improve the interface between the adhesive and the adherend. We also added hydrophobic fumed silica to the adhesive formulation to enhance its overall bond strength and toughness. The single lap-shear tests were carried out to study the lap-shear strength (LSS) of the adhesively bonded joints. It was shown that the presence of the adhesion promoter on AP-treated adherends results in a minimum increase of 196 % in LSS. It was observed that the adhesion promoter has a plasticizing effect in the absence of AP treatment, resulting in poor mechanical strength of the joints. Fumed silica has been shown to significantly impact the LSS of aluminum and glass adherends, increasing it by a factor of 3 and 4, respectively, at the concentration of 5 phr. In all cases, glass specimens exhibited stronger bonds.

AB Since the seminal discovery by van der Waals in the late 19 th century that weak attractive forces exist between even electrically neutral atoms or molecules, a number of noncovalent interactions have been recognized. Among them, electrostatic interactions such as hydrogen bonds play pivotal roles in countless chemical processes and biochemical living systems. By mimicking biocatalysis, various organocatalysts equipped with hydrogen-bond functionality have been developed; however, a challenge has persisted in designing catalysts exploiting other types of noncovalent interactions. Here, we report metal-free hydroboration reactions of carbonyl compounds and CO2 catalyzed by aromatic diazadiborinine. A joint experimental and computational study on the reaction mechanism suggests that adducts of diazadiborinine with carbonyl and CO2 formed at the initial stage of the reactions serve as actual catalysts. The former stabilizes the transition state by using the electrostatic interaction between the hydride of borane and the polar, hole-shaped structure of the adduct.

AB Swapping the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for the thermodynamically advantageous sulfur ion oxidation reaction (SOR) makes it possible to produce low-energy hydrogen. We report here on an electrocatalytic SOR-coupled HER system that allows for the joint production of sulfur and hydrogen. We prepare a CoMoO4 nanoarray on nickel foam (NF) for anodic SOR and N-doped CoMoO4/NF, CoMoN/NF, for cathodic HER. The current density of 100 mA cm(-2) was obtained at 0.29 V (vs RHE) in the SOR process. After nitridation, the electrode can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in HER at a voltage of only 32 mV (vs RHE). The coupling system (SOR//HER) can run steadily for 150 h. Detailed exploration and discussion were conducted on the pathways of SOR. This work develops an energy-efficient mixed water electrolysis system for H-2, providing a viable option for toxic waste treatment.

DE Optimal weight algorithm; Dynamic time scale; Stability
AB The study of time scale facilitates stable and reliable operation of time-keeping systems. Algos algorithm is a common method for calculating the time scale. Improving the stability of the time scale is an important issue in the research of time-keeping technology. In this paper, an optimization method of the clock difference data preprocessing in algorithm is proposed. We apply the theory of optimal weight to the calculation of time scale weight for improving the stability of the dynamic time scale. The proposed algorithm is called Improved Dynamic Algos-like (IDAlgos). We use the IDAlgos for joint experiments of cesium clocks ensemble, hydrogen masers ensemble, and hydrogen-cesium clocks ensemble, respectively. The results compared with Conventional Dynamic Algos-like (CDAlgos) show that i) for the case of cesium clocks ensemble, the short-term stability has been improved, the stability increased by 22.5% in 2 h and 20.8% in 4 h. ii) for the case of hydrogen masers ensemble, the stability increased by 18.3% in 1 h and 31.3% in 128 h, that is, both long-term and short-term stability has been improved. iii) for the clock ensemble combined of hydrogen masers and cesium clocks, the long-term and short-term stability has been greatly improved,among them, the stability increased by 64.6% in 1 h and 69.3% in 128 h. Consequently, the IDAlgos has obvious improving on the stability of the time scale

AB A new potassium cadmium hydrogen diphosphate dihydrate, KCdHP2O7 center dot 2H(2)0 (1), has been synthesized by slow evaporation at room temperature and characterized by FT-IR, Raman, TG-DTA, and single crystal X-ray diffraction. Compound (1) crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pcmn space group with the unit cell parameters a= 6.5814(8) angstrom, b = 7.9428(9) angstrom, c = 15.961(6) angstrom, V 834.4(3) angstrom(3) and Z = 4. Its structure consists of polyhedral layers parallel to the ab plane where each CdO6 octahedron (m position) shares four edges with three different diphosphate groups. In the Cd octahedron, two oxygen atoms residing in (m) special positions belong to coordinated water molecules. These layers are joint by K+ cations (4c Wyckoff position) and hydrogen bonds, leading thus to a two-dimensional framework. The structural model is supported by the bond-valence-sum validation tool as calculated valences are close to the formal oxidation numbers.

AB In the present work, the influence of hot-dip galvanization (HDG) on the fatigue behaviour of high-strength bolted details is investigated through a set of 15 constant-amplitude tests. Cyclic behaviour of coated specimens is hence compared against results for unprotected samples drawn from literature, i.e., both with reference to neutral and aggressive exposure conditions. Namely, while behaviour of coated samples is moderately inferior as respect to uncoated ones in dry air (-6 % in terms of characteristic fatigue strength, probability of failure PF = 5 %, confidence interval CI = 75 %), their performance still complies with European normative requirements for double covered joints, and galvanization proves to be highly effective when corrosion is likely to occur (with a characteristic strength increase of [+12 %; +52 %]). Finally, fractography analyses on both uncoated and coated specimens were performed, suggesting that hydrogen embrittlement may play a role in reducing fatigue strength of coated joints, that is, especially within the high-cycle fatigue regime.

Undergraduate plasma physics students from three universities-Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (National Research University), RUDN University, and National Research Nuclear University MEPhI-carried out joint remote experiments to train in tokamak operation and to study topics relevant for mainstream fusion research such as plasma start-up, comparison of hydrogen versus helium plasma characteristics, electrostatic and electromagnetic turbulence, long-range correlations, etc. New observations of the long-range correlations between low-frequency (<50 kHz) quasi-coherent electrostatic and magnetic oscillations identified as m = 2 mode with several techniques were done, as well as of the broadband (<250 kHz) magnetic oscillations resolved in frequency and wave vector in helium and hydrogen plasmas. The presence of broadband electrostatic and broadband magnetic turbulence has also been established at the plasma edge.

AB A high Cr-Ni austenite wire with 0.1% nitrogen was developed for gas metal arc welding of high strength low alloy (HSLA) steel (10Ni5CrMoV) to prevent hydrogen induced crack. The austenite weld joint without visible defects can be obtained using Ar + He + N-2 shielding gas. When N-2 content of shielding gas increased from 0% to 8%, the nitrogen content of weld metal rose from 0.10% to 0.19%, and other alloy content kept unchanged. The increasing of nitrogen content in weld metal made weld grains refined. It can improve mechanical properties of weld metal in different degrees including yield strength, tensile strength, elongation and impact toughness. However, with 8% N-2 content of shielding gas, the massive microspores appeared in weld metal will decrease the welded joint properties. Therefore, 50%Ar + 45%He + 5%N-2 was selected for welding of 10Ni5CrMoV HSLA steel using high Cr-Ni austenite wire.

AB The crisscross progress of transportation and energy carries the migrating track of human society development and the evolution of civilization, among which the decarbonization strategy is a key issue. Traffic carbon emissions account for 16.2% of total energy carbon emissions, while road traffic carbon emissions account for 11.8% of total energy carbon emissions. Therefore, road traffic is a vital battlefield in attaining the goal of decarbonization. Employing clean energy as an alternative fuel is of great significance to the transformation of the energy consumption structure in road transportation. Hydrogen and ammonia are renewable energy with the characteristics of being widely distributed and clean. Both exist naturally in nature, and the products of complete combustion are substances (water and nitrogen) that do not pollute the atmosphere. Because it can promote agricultural production, ammonia has a long history in human society. Both have the potential to replace traditional fossil fuel energy. An overview of the advantages of hydrogen and ammonia, as well as their development in different countries such as the United States, the European Union, Japan, and other major development regions is presented in this paper. Related research topics of hydrogen and ammonia's production, storage and transferring technology have also been analyzed and collated to stimulate the energy production chain for road transportation. The current cost of green hydrogen is between $2.70-$8.80 globally, which is expected to approach $2-$6 by 2030. Furthermore, the technical development of hydrogen and ammonia as a fuel for engines and fuel cells in road transportation is compared in detail, and the tests, practical applications and commercial popularization of these technologies are summarized, respectively. Opportunities and challenges coexist in the era of the renewable energy. Based on the characteristics and development track of hydrogen and ammonia, the joint development of these two types of energy is meant to be imperative. The collaborative development mode of hydrogen and ammonia, together with the obstacles to their development of them are both compared and discussed. Finally, referring to the efforts and experiences of different countries in promoting hydrogen and ammonia in road transportation, corresponding constructive suggestions have been put forward for reference. At the end of the paper, a framework diagram of hydrogen and ammonia industry chains is provided, and the mutual promotion development relationship of the two energy sources is systematically summarized.

AB Photocatalytic water splitting (PWS) is one of the promising hydrogen production technologies. Studying the operation characteristics of multi-energy coupling system based on photocatalytic hydrogen production is beneficial to the popularization and application of this technology. A novel zero-carbon emission system that integrates freshwater, hydrogen, and electricity co-generation driven by solar energy is developed in this paper. The integrated system comprises a multistage flash desalination (MSFD) subsystem, a PWS subsystem, and a fuel cell (FC) subsystem. Considering the inherent variability and intermittency of solar energy availability, an energy storage module is strategically implemented to ensure stable and reliable system operation. The detailed model of the complete integrated system is meticulously developed and refined using Aspen Plus software. Taking the meteorological data of Hainan, China as an example, the operational parameters of the system are designed. Parametric analyses are conducted on the system's freshwater production, hydrogen generation, and electricity output. A comprehensive evaluation is made on the thermodynamic and environmental aspects of the integrated system. The results demonstrate that the system, designed to operate continuously throughout the year, achieves this with an initial storage capacity of 85 m3 for freshwater and 130 kmol for hydrogen. Over an annual cycle, MSFD subsystem produces approximately 1812.23 m3 of freshwater, while PWS subsystem utilizes 1560.00 m3 of this freshwater to generate 2830.82 kg of hydrogen. Subsequently, FC subsystem consumes approximately 2816.63 kg of hydrogen per year to generate 43,800 kWh of electricity, while the total annual electricity consumption for the integrated system is recorded at 1995.01 kWh. The system demonstrates an average annual energy efficiency of 58.4 % and exergy efficiency of 11.2 %, illustrating both effective energy use and conversion. Furthermore, the system's operation leads to a significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, amounting to a total annual decrease of 31884.98 kg. Collectively, the significant contribution of this study is to emphasize the potential of autonomously operated joint systems through the synergistic utilization of renewable energy and hydrogen energy. The specific innovative zero-carbon emission system, driven by solar energy, provides a theoretical framework for the development of integrated strategies for the utilization of solar and hydrogen energy.

AB The effects of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) on guanidinium chloride and hydrogen-bonded networks of water are explored in this joint Raman spectroscopic and quantum chemical study. Both TMAO and guanidinium are osmolytes that affect the stability of proteins, as TMAO is known to stabilize and counteract the destabilizing effects of guanidinium. While guanidinium is very similar in chemical structure to urea, the exact mechanisms of the molecular interactions between guanidinium, TMAO, and proteins continue to be investigated. Herein, we use Raman spectroscopy to elucidate the physical interactions between TMAO and guanidinium in aqueous solutions to better understand how these important osmolytes interact with each other and affect adjacent hydrogen-bonding networks of water. Comparing experiment to theory yields good agreement and allows for the identification and tracking of different vibrational modes. It was determined that adding TMAO into an aqueous solution of guanidinium induces a blue shift (shift to higher energy) in guanidinium's H-N-H bending modes, which is indicative of direct interactions between the two osmolytes and similar to the earlier results observed for TMAO interacting with urea.

AB The use of cold metal transfer process (CMT) is an excellent alternative to depositing nickel-based alloys on oil and gas pipelines due to the relatively small dilution. However, sulfide stress corrosion cracking (SSCC) of dissimilar weld joints has proven to be an issue. Therefore, this study investigates the microstructure and SSCC behavior of an Inconel 625/ X80 weld overlay fabricated CMT process focusing on the tempering effect. Four-point bending tests show a high SSCC susceptibility of the non-overlap zone due to the forma-tion of coarse structure in the heat affected zone and narrow martensite layer along the fusion boundary. However, microstructural characterization indicates a tempering effect in the overlap zone, producing homogenized microstructure and less residual strain in the heat affected zone. Therefore, the SSCC resistance is greatly improved, especially for the fusion boundary, because reversed austenite in the martensite layer could decrease the accumulation of hydrogen at lath boundaries.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB Background: Antiseptic solutions are commonly utilized during total joint arthroplasty (TJA) to prevent and treat periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). The purpose of this study was to investigate which antiseptic solution is most effective against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Escherichia coli biofilms established in vitro on orthopaedic surfaces commonly utilized in total knee arthroplasty: cobalt-chromium (CC), oxidized zirconium (OxZr), and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). Methods: MSSA and E. coli biofilms were grown on CC, OxZr, and PMMA discs for 24 and 72 hours. Biofilm-coated discs were treated with control or various antiseptic solutions for 3 minutes. Solutions included 10% povidone-iodine, a 1:1 mixture of 10% povidone-iodine plus 3% hydrogen peroxide, diluted povidone-iodine, 0.05% chlorhexidine gluconate, and a surfactant-based formulation of ethanol, acetic acid, sodium acetate, benzalkonium chloride, and water. Following treatment, discs were sonicated to quantify adherent bacteria or underwent imaging with scanning electron microscopy to identify biofilm. Antiseptic solutions were considered efficacious if they produced a 3-log (1,000-fold) reduction in colony-forming units compared with controls. Results: On both OxZr and CC, 10% povidone-iodine with hydrogen peroxide eradicated all MSSA, and it achieved clinical efficacy on PMMA at both 24-hour MSSA biofilm (p < 0.0002) and 72-hour MSSA biofilm (p = 0.002). On 72-hour MSSA biofilm, 10% povidone-iodine eradicated all bacteria on OxZr and CC, and it achieved clinical efficacy on PMMA (p = 0.04). On 24-hour MSSA biofilm, 10% povidone-iodine achieved efficacy on all surfaces (all p < 0.01). The surfactant-based formulation only achieved clinical efficacy on 72-hour MSSA biofilms on CC (p = 0.04) and OxZr (p = 0.07). On 72-hour E. coli biofilm, 10% povidone-iodine with or without hydrogen peroxide achieved clinical efficacy on all surfaces. No other solution achieved clinical efficacy on either MSSA or E. coli. Conclusions: Antiseptic solutions vary considerably in efficacy against bacterial biofilm. The 10% povidone-iodine solution with or without hydrogen peroxide consistently removed MSSA and E. coli biofilms on multiple orthopaedic surfaces and should be considered for clinical use. Clinical Relevance: Clinicians should be aware of the differences in the efficacy of antiseptic solutions on different orthopaedic surfaces when treating MSSA or E. coli biofilms.

AB The internal cracking observed in a 6 ''-thick carbon-manganese steel plate after welding is discussed with respect to the presence of material impurities. The morphology and location of the cracks detected during fabrication of a heavy structure are typical of hydrogen-induced cracking (HIC) usually associated to hard untempered martensite. However, typically martensitic microstructures would not be expected for low carbon low alloy steels joints when a suitable welding procedure specification is adopted, which includes preheating and high heat input. This paper illustrates the morphology of the original cracks, which are unrelated to hard microstructures, and presents the results of the welding experiments conducted in samples cut from segregated regions of the 6 ''-thick plate. Through hydrogenation of thin slices containing impure regions and autogenous gas tungsten arc welding bead, it was possible to reproduce the same cracking characteristics formed during submerged arc welding, indicating that HIC may also be associated to softer phases. Hydrogen entrapment at the weld fusion line can be related to high impurities level due to the expected lower melting points at grain boundaries, explaining the HIC phenomenon. The present paper proposes a model for hydrogen cracking of bainitic structures at the welding heat affected zone that typically is not susceptible to crack. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB Energy storage plays an essential role in stabilizing fluctuations in renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, enabling surplus electricity retention, and delivering dynamic frequency regulation. However, relying solely on a single form of storage often proves insufficient due to constraints in performance, capacity, and cost-effectiveness. To tackle frequency regulation challenges in remote desert-based renewable energy hubs-where traditional power infrastructure is unavailable-this study introduces a planning framework for an electro-hydrogen energy storage system with grid-forming capabilities, designed to supply both inertia and frequency response. At the system design stage, a direct current (DC) transmission network is modeled, integrating battery and hydrogen storage technologies. Using this configuration, the capacity settings for both grid-forming batteries and hydrogen units are optimized. This study then explores how hydrogen systems-comprising electrolyzers, storage tanks, and fuel cells-and grid-forming batteries contribute to inertial support. Virtual inertia models are established for each technology, enabling precise estimation of the total synthetic inertia provided. At the operational level, this study addresses stability concerns stemming from renewable generation variability by introducing three security indices. A joint optimization is performed for virtual inertia constants, which define the virtual inertia provided by energy storage systems to assist in frequency regulation, and primary frequency response parameters within the proposed storage scheme are optimized in this model. This enhances the frequency modulation potential of both systems and confirms the robustness of the proposed approach. Lastly, a real-world case study involving a 13 GW renewable energy base in Northwest China, connected via a +/- 10 GW HVDC export corridor, demonstrates the practical effectiveness of the optimization strategy and system configuration.

AB The formation process of the active component of 0.5%Pd-0.5%Ag catalysts supported on the carbon black/ pyrolytic synthetic carbon composite << Sibunit >>, which were synthesized by joint impregnation, was studied. XRD and EXAFS studies revealed that heating of the Pd-Ag/Sibunit catalyst in hydrogen at 400-500 degrees C results in the formation of bimetallic solid solution Pd0.6Ag0.4. The bimetallic particles are characterized by an increased distance between neighboring palladium atoms (2.78-2.80 angstrom), as compared to metallic palladium and by an increase in the electron density on palladium atoms under the action of silver (according to XPS data). The synthesized samples with supported Pd-Ag nanoparticles make it possible to obtain C2H4 by ethyne hydrogenation with the selectivity of 77-78%.

AB Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease which results in progressive destruction of the joint. In this study, we examined if the hydrogen could inhibit inflammation in a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) via oxidative stress on RA-FLSs. Moreover, to identify the mechanisms of action, we evaluated the effect of hydrogen on RA-FLSs development and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and signaling pathways. Based on our result, H-2 enriched medium can increase super oxide dismutase (SOD) level following H2O2 treatment and decrease 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) level. Since H2O2 treatment activates MAPK, NF-kappa B and TGF-beta 1 in cells, our study suggested that H-2 could inhibit H2O2 activated MAPK and NF-kappa B activation as well as TGF-beta 1 expression in treated cells. Taken together, our data suggested that H-2 can directly neutralize OH and ONOO-to reduce oxidative stress. Moreover, MAPK and NF-kappa B pathway also play roles in oxidative damage caused by H2O2 in RA-FLSs. H-2 can provide protection to cells against inflammation, which may be related to inhibition of the activation of MAPK and NF-kappa B.

AB The formation of brittle microstructures around the fusion line in dissimilar welds has required a deeper microstructural analysis in this region. The study becomes more relevant when these welds are used in environments that facilitate hydrogen embrittlement. The present work aims to characterize the microstructure and hardness at the diluted zone interface in joints welded with dissimilar materials. Aiming for a better efficacy in the microstructural characterization of this zone, samples of both normal cross-section (NCS) and section with slope were used, according to the low-angle microsectioning (LAMS) technique, which allows a greater amplification of partially mixed zones (PMZs). The results indicated the diffusion of carbon from the heat-affected zone (HAZ) towards the fusion line which, in combination with other alloying elements, form highly brittle carbides. In turn, the hardness of the base metal and the HAZ was reduced after post weld heat treatment, whereas in the weld metal an opposite behavior was observed. The dissimilar interface was promising for applications in environments facilitating hydrogen embrittlement, especially regarding the characteristics of zone Phi.

AB New policies and strict emission limits in the transports sector result in a gradual switch towards alternative fuels and hydrogen is getting attention: fuel cell systems are considered ideal energy converters of the next future. As the interest is rising in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC), there is a need for experimental research and dedicated laboratories on systems designed with Balance of Plant. In this context, the HI-SEA Laboratory (240-kW PEMFC by Nuvera FC, a joint between the University of Genoa-Fincantieri) was born. In this paper, the tuning of the laboratory to simulate a ship-likely environment is addressed, looking at the main problematics and resolutions, related to the cathodic line and the cooling control. Some guidelines are defined to install a PEMFC system onboard a ship exploiting the existing infrastructure. Thanks to the experimental campaign, a stack voltage model previously validated is employed to evaluate the performance of the system. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB Flexible wearable sensors originating from ionogels have found extensive and significant applications in electronic skins, body-health monitoring, and personal healthcare diagnosis. Developing an ionogel-based sensor with robust mechanics and durable sensing in a wide service temperature range remains challenging. Herein, a high-performance wearable sensor with temperature-tolerant mechanics and durable sensing was constructed by virtue of hydrogen bonding between a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-incorporated nanocomposite interpenetrating network and an ionic liquid, i.e., 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide ([C4mim][I]). Through modulation of hydrogen bonding and thus good compatibility between [C4mim][I] and the network, the ionogels exhibited superior mechanics, excellent antifatigue, and durable sensing in a wide working temperature range. The ionogel-based wearable sensor exhibited stable and repeatable sensitivity toward various human motions including finger bending, elbow joint bending, and swallowing. More importantly, the pressure sensing can be completely preserved in a service temperature range of -20 to 80 degrees C. This work provided a feasible method to construct a mechanically strong, temperature-durable ionogel-based multimode sensor, which would find versatile applications as electronic skins, human-motion detection, and intelligent devices.

AB The reformer effluent is serially cooled down to produce hydrogen in the hydrogen unit of an oil refinery. The process heat from effluent is effectively utilized for low pressure steam generation using heat exchanger. The exchanger shell and tube side fluids were boiler feed water and process gas, respectively. Several tubes of this heat exchanger were failed especially within tube sheet after 4 years of useful service. Therefore, failed exchanger tube was subjected to engineering failure analysis to determine the cause of failure. Initially visual inspection was conducted using videoscopy in heat exchanger dry condition and evidenced circumferential crack. Subsequently, all failed tubes were separated from U tube bundle. Selected tube was subjected to visual inspection, dye penetrant and dimensional measurement. No evidence of visual deformation and thickness loss observed in the failed tube. Further investigated tube was subjected to chemical analysis and confirmed the required metallurgy as per design specification. The fracture surface was subjected to elemental analysis, fractographic, metallographic and hardness investigations. The micro hardness of an exchanger tube at failure location was higher than specified hardness value. Investigation also revealed that exchanger tubes were expanded from tube inner surface to establish tube to tube sheet joint according to specified design drawing. Tube expansion was done prior to start of service and attributed to residual stress within tube material. The results revealed that presence of chloride in the accumulated deposits within tube to tube sheet joint favored conducive environment for chloride stress corrosion cracking. Recommendations were suggested for failure prevention. Achievement in this paper may supplement the similar heat exchanger tube failure database and mitigation of failure will be possible by good engineering practices.

AB In order to achieve energy consumption optimization and decarbonization in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), this article establishes a novel framework for optimal scheduling of park-level integrated energy systems (PIESs). This framework incorporates carbon capture technologies alongside a multienergy joint supply subsystem model featuring hydrogen storage, complemented by a structured stepped carbon trading mechanism. Furthermore, a novel optimized federation model is developed to balance low carbon emissions and economic performance by federating the carbon capture system into the tiered carbon trading mechanism. The primary objective of this model in the context of the IIoT is to minimize energy procurement costs, wind abandonment costs, and carbon trading expenses while maximizing revenues from carbon dioxide sales. The CPLEX optimization tool is utilized to address this complex challenge. Finally, several scenarios are simulated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimized PIESs in reducing the operational costs and minimizing carbon footprint.

AB This article describes the history of the investigations of shock wave interactions at the Physical Gasdynamic Department, starting from the early 50s of the last century, when the first research related to missile reentry was made. The review focuses on a number of topics studied over more than 50 years and includes the study of strong shock waves, where it is necessary to take into account the physicochemical transformations in gases, shock wave reflection, diffraction, interaction with the boundary layer and with the nozzle, as well as detonation wave formation and interactions. The investigation of shock wave interactions is a current topic at the Joint Institute for High Temperatures of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Some new results are observed: the formation of impulse jets and the self-ignition of a cold hydrogen jet, diffraction of 3D shock waves, and the effect of an impulse jet and diffracted shock wave on an obstacle.

AB In this work, the Ni-Mg-O oxide system was studied as a constituent of the joint Ni-Mg-O/V-Mg-O catalytic system in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. A sol-gel method was used to synthesize the samples in order to achieve high textural characteristics of the system and a uniform distribution of NiO particles in the matrix of magnesium oxide. It was demonstrated that the addition of the Ni-Mg-O component led to a significant increase in the yield of ethylene at temperatures of 600-650 degrees C. In this case, selectivity did not decrease significantly. The redox properties of Ni-Mg-O were studied in the cycles of temperature-programmed reduction in an atmosphere of hydrogen or carbon monoxide and subsequent reoxidation with atmospheric oxygen. It was shown that the Ni-Mg-O system can repeatedly uptake hydrogen and convert CO; this fact makes it possible to consider this material as a promising oxygen carrier for chemical looping. The observed increase in the yield of ethylene was due to the uptake of hydrogen released at the stage of ethane dehydrogenation and the related shift of thermodynamic equilibrium.

AB This paper presents a statistically more likely distribution (SMLD) approach for the evaluation of the presumed probability density function (PDF) in flamelet progress variable (FPV) models for non-premixed supersonic combustion. The numerical simulation of the NASA Langley Research Center supersonic H-2-Air combustion chamber is performed using two approaches: the first one is a standard FPV model, built presuming the functional shape of the PDFs of the mixture fraction, Z, and of the progress parameter, Lambda; the second approach employs the SMLD technique to presume the joint PDF of Z and Lambda. The standard and FPV-SMLD models have been developed using the low Mach number assumption. In both cases, the temperature is evaluated by solving the total-energy conservation equation, providing a more suitable approach for the simulation of supersonic combustion. By comparison with experimental data, the proposed SMLD model is shown to provide a clear improvement with respect to the standard FPV model, especially in the auto-ignition and stabilization regions of the flame.

AB Inflammatory arthritis primarily involves rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inflammatory osteoarthritis (OA), both characterized by shared inflammation in the articular joints and cartilage degeneration. These conditions lead to joint pain, loss of function, and a decline in quality of life. Triamcinolone acetonide (TA), an intermediate-acting synthetic glucocorticoid, is widely used as an anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of inflammatory arthritis. However, its clinical application faces challenges such as rapid clearance from the joint cavity following intra-articular (IA) administration, the risk of joint damage with repeated injections, and the invasive nature of the IA injection route. To address these drawbacks, we propose sucrose acetate isobutyrate (SAIB), a biocompatible matrix, as a promising strategy for sustained drug release via intramuscular (IM) injection. Building on this approach, we designed a gallic acid-modified triamcinolone acetonide derivative (TA-GA) and incorporated it into the SAIB matrix to create the TA-GA-SAIB depot. The modification of TA with gallic acid (GA) effectively mitigates the burst release commonly observed in SAIB formulations, attributed to hydrogen bonding interactions between TA-GA and the SAIB matrix. Benzyl alcohol (BA) was selected as the optimal solvent to achieve minimal burst release during the in vitro drug release study. The TA-GA-SAIB depot exhibited sustained in vivo drug release, enhanced anti-inflammatory effects, and significant improvement in cartilage damage, along with excellent safety and biocompatibility. The synergy between the SAIB matrix and TA-GA not only enables sustained drug release but also improves therapeutic efficacy, making it a promising system for the treatment of inflammatory arthritis via intramuscular administration.

AB Irrigation and debridement using an irrigation solution is a fundamental step during the surgical treatment of both acute and chronic periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). However, there is no consensus on the optimal solution, nor is there sufficient evidence on the optimal irrigation time and combination of solutions. Therefore, it is necessary to determine which solution or combination of solutions is most efficacious against biofilm, as well as the optimal irrigation time. We conducted an experimental in vitro model by inoculating stainless steel discs with ATCC strains of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and a clinical strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis. The discs were all irrigated with commonly used antiseptic solutions (10% and 3% povidone iodine, hydrogen peroxide, 3% acetic acid, and Bactisure (TM)) for 1 min, 3 min, and 5 min and their combinations for 9 min (3 min each) vs. sterile saline as a positive control. We evaluated the reduction in biofilm based on colony-forming unit (cfu) counts and in combination assays, also based on cell viability and scanning electron microscopy. All antiseptics alone reduced more than 90% of cfu counts after 1 min of irrigation; the worst results were for hydrogen peroxide and 3% acetic acid. When solutions were sequentially combined, the best results were observed for all those starting with acetic acid, in terms of both reduction of log cfu/mL counts and viable cells. We consider that a combination of antiseptic solutions, particularly that comprising the sequence acetic acid + povidone iodine + hydrogen peroxide, would be the best option for chemical debridement during PJI surgery.

AB Pure titanium is often used in the manufacture of pressure vessels due to its excellent corrosion resistance. Pressure vessels are generally operated in various corrosive media and subjected to varying degrees of corrosion. Stress corrosion cracking is one of the most dangerous forms of damage to pressure vessels used in various fields. Welded joints become the weak link of the pressure vessels because of the uneven microstructure and welding residual stress, which could cause stress corrosion and directly affect the overall performance and service life of pressure vessels. At present, as a method to improve the mechanical and corrosion properties of materials, shot peening has been widely studied. However, shot peening often leads to the increase of surface roughness and even causes defects such as cracks and surface damage, which will affect the effect of improving the corrosion resistance of materials. It remains to be further studied that the specific influence of surface roughness on the stress corrosion resistance of metal materials. In this work, the stress corrosion behavior of the original samples, ultrasonic shot peening (USSP) samples and USSP with surface polished samples of TA2 titanium welded joints in 10%HCI solution were studied by slow strain rate tension (SSRT) experiment. OM, TEM and SEM were used to observe the microstructure and corrosion fracture morphology of the welded joints. The surface roughness and residual stress of different processed samples were measured, and the corrosion mechanisms were analyzed. The results showed that both stress corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement occurred in pure titanium welded joints in this system, and weld metal (WM) was the weakest link in the welded joint. The stress corrosion cracking susceptibility index (I-scc) of the original sample in this system was 25.61%, indicating a tendency of stress corrosion. The I-scc of the USSP sample was reduced by 28.78%, and that of the USSP with surface polished (1500#) sample was reduced by 53.3%; both of them had no obvious tendency of stress corrosion in the system. The roughness of the USSP surface could cause stress concentration to form a crack source, which was similar to the pitting propagation. USSP with surface polished treatment reduced the surface roughness, achieving the homogenization of the stress distribution and increasing the elongation and the plasticity of the samples, which could further improve the stress corrosion cracking resistance.

AB Here we present a joint experimental -theoretical study on the deposition of imidazole molecules on a Cu(100) surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Surface -enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) have been carried out on samples prepared upon deposition of sublimated imidazole molecules in ultra -high vacuum (UHV). Computational studies, performed in the frame of the density functional theory (DFT), include a wide variety of models where the coadsorption of imidazole molecules and dehydrogenated species takes place. The combination of measurements and simulations demonstrates the formation of two types of coating at the metal-organic interface: (i) self -assembled monolayers stabilized through intermolecular hydrogen bonds and (ii) polymeric species with new C-C bonds established between the imidazole units.

AB Due to the moist environment and inevitable movement, efficient wound closure and healing of vulnerable joint skin remains a great challenge. Herein, a poly(gamma-glutamic acid)-crosslinked amino-functionalized PEGylated poly(glycerol sebacate) (gamma-PGA/PEGS-NH2) adhesive hydrogel is reported. PEGS-NH2 and gamma-PGA not only forms covalent amide bonds with biological tissue surfaces to achieve strong moist adhesion but also establishes a stable chemically crosslinked network in bulk hydrogels to resist deformation. Furthermore, bioinspired gallic acid-modified chitosan (CS-GA) is introduced to enhance moist adhesion via multiple hydrogen bonds and establish a dynamic physically crosslinked network to dissipate energy. Consequently, this adhesive hydrogel strongly adheres to moist biological tissue, showing an adhesion six times higher than that of fibrin glue and comparable to that of strong cyanoacrylate glue. Moreover, benefiting from high mechanical resilience and effective energy dissipation, 200 cycles of loading-unloading mechanical tests conducted under an adhesive state and a full-thickness rat skin incision model applied on a dynamic nape further confirmed the desirable dynamic tissue adhesion and wound healing performance. Combining the above ideal features with their good injectability and shape-adaptability to complex contours, such adhesive hydrogels are demonstrated to be promising candidates for joint wound closure and healing in moist and dynamic physiological environment.

AB The hydrogen-induced stress corrosion cracking (HISCC) behavior of SUS301L-MT stainless steel laser-arc hybrid welding (LAHW) joints was investigated using slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) method in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution under different cathodic potentials. With the negative shift of applied potentials from open circle potential (OCP) to -1400 mV(SCE), the HISCC susceptibility index (I-SSRT) decreased from 0.15 (OCP) to 0.06 (-400 mV(SCE)), then increased to 0.28 (-1400 mV(SCE)). The specimens tested in air and under OCP to -800 mV ruptured in weld metal zone with ductile features of dimples. While with the potential turned more negative, the specimens ruptured in base metal zone with brittle features of transgranular cleave in martensite, intergranular failure and secondary cracks.

AB This study investigated the stress corrosion cracking (SCC) mechanism of 304L under a glycine environment through electrochemical measurements, soaking test, and slow strain rate tensile test. Results show that the rapidly cooled structure at the weld heat-affected zone has a significantly higher susceptibility to SCC than the open grain structure. Moreover, glycine concentration influences the electrochemical and SCC behaviors of 304L. The corrosion current density, maintaining a passive current density, and susceptibility to SCC of 304L are proportional to glycine concentration. Meanwhile, the SCC on the sensitized structure of 304L is a joint consequence of anodic dissolution (AD) and hydrogen embrittlement (HE). Intergranular AD initiates cracks, whereas the synergistic effect of AD and HE accelerates crack extension.

AB A material with porous structures formed by jointed aza- and oxa-aza-crowns with peripheral OHgroups is synthesized on the basis of cellulose fabric and PVC transformed into hydroxyethylcyclam. Mesopores are mainly observed on the fiber surface. The specific surface of the material is 6 m(2)/g; the volume of free space is 0.112 cm(3)/g. Assuming the internal pores have a disk-like shape, their width is estimated at 2 nm. The material sorbs vapors of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, amines, amides, nitriles, and sulfoxides. It also swells to a limited degree in organic solvents. When sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide is sorbed in the pores, compounds of them with H+- and OH--conducting systems of hydrogen bonds are formed.

AB The balance between softening and hardening is still a great challenge for the laser welding of the high strength low alloy steel. For example, welding with low heat input was commonly used to avoid softening, but it would inversely harden the joint and introduce the undesired welding defects such as hydrogen-induced cracks. This work proposed a simple and robust processing technique, denominated High Frequency electric cooperated Laser Welding. Laser heat source was combined with high-frequency electric heat source to balance heat input distribution and reconcile the contradiction between softening and hardening in the welding of high strength low alloy steel. As a structural material sensitive to welding softening and hardening, S690QL steel was adopted to show the fundamental advancement of the new process. Benefitted from the skin effect and proximity effect of high-frequency current that improve the heat input distribution and the regulation of the high-frequency heat input proportion, the martensite content in the heat affected zone was greatly reduced, whilst the grain size was limited to a low value. Under the high-frequency heat input proportion of 47.1 %, lower bainite distributed throughout the heat affected zone. The softening and hardening issues of the joint therefore have been improved simultaneously: the tensile strength of the joint was almost equal to that of the base material, the impact energy of weld seam and the heat affected zone reached 77.6 J and 66.2 J respectively.

AB The dynamic restructuring of Cu surfaces in electroreduction conditions is of fundamental interest in electrocatalysis. We decode the structural dynamics of a Cu(111) electrode under reduction conditions by joint first-principles calculations and operando electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (ECSTM) experiments. Combining global optimization and grand canonical density functional theory, we unravel the potential- and pH-dependent restructuring of Cu(111) in acidic electrolyte. At reductive potential, Cu(111) is covered by a high density of H atoms and, below a threshold potential, Cu adatoms are formed on the surface in a (4x4) superstructure, a restructuring unfavorable in vacuum. The strong H adsorption is the driving force for the restructuring, itself induced by the electrode potential. On the restructured surface, barriers for hydrogen evolution reaction steps are low. Restructuring in electroreduction conditions creates highly active Cu adatom sites not present on Cu(111).

AB Silver-doped diamond-like carbon (Ag-DLC) films offer low residual stress, good adhesion, and excellent wear resistance, and thus are promising materials for surface modification of joint prostheses. Further, as proteins are the most abundant component of joint fluid, the wear performance of Ag-DLC films in protein environments warrants investigation. We prepared DLC and 10.0 at.% Ag-DLC films using hybrid deposition technique by combining high-power pulsed magnetron sputtering and high-power pulsed plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The wear performance of the films was tested using bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution. A biofilm of denatured proteins formed at the friction interface of the Ag-DLC film, which improve wear resistance. Subsequent protein adsorption, Ag+ ions release, and spectroscopic evaluation of the interaction between Ag+ ions and BSA molecules revealed the mechanism of biofilm formation. Ag doping promoted the protein adsorption on film surface and friction interface of Ag-DLC films. Meanwhile, Ag-DLC films released Ag+ ions when exposed in physiological solutions. The released Ag+ ions break the hydrogen bonds and disulfide bonds in proteins and transform the alpha-helix structure to beta-sheet and beta-turn structure, thus unfolding the protein, exposing the inner hydrophobic groups, and inducing protein deposition and biofilm formation. The study elucidates the biofilm formation mechanism at the friction interface of Ag-DLC films and counterparts and can aid in design of hardwearing joint implants.

AB The need to significantly reduce emissions from the steelmaking sector requires effective and ready-to-use technical solutions. With this aim, different decarbonization strategies have been investigated by both researchers and practitioners. To this concern, the most promising pathway is represented by the replacement of natural gas with pure hydrogen in the direct reduced iron (DRI) production process to feed an electric arc furnace (EAF). This solution allows to significantly reduce direct emissions of carbon dioxide from the DRI process but requires a significant amount of electricity to power electrolyzers adopted to produce hydrogen. The adoption of renewable electricity sources (green hydrogen) would reduce emissions by 95-100% compared to the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) route. In this work, an analytical model for the identification of the minimum emission configuration of a green energy-steel system consisting of a secondary route supported by a DRI production process and a renewable energy conversion system is proposed. In the model, both technological features of the hydrogen steel plant and renewable energy production potential of the site where it is to be located are considered. Compared to previous studies, the novelty of this work consists of the joint modeling of a renewable energy system and a steel plant. This allows to optimize the overall system from an environmental point of view, considering the availability of green hydrogen as an inherent part of the model. Numerical experiments proved the effectiveness of the model proposed in evaluating the suitability of using green hydrogen in the steelmaking process. Depending on the characteristics of the site and the renewable energy conversion system adopted, decreases in emissions ranging from 60% to 91%, compared to the BF-BOF route, were observed for the green energy-steel system considered It was found that the environmental benefit of using hydrogen in the secondary route is strictly related to the national energy mix and to the electrolyzers' technology. Depending on the reference context, it was found that there exists a maximum value of the emission factor from the national electricity grid below which is environmentally convenient to produce DRI by using only hydrogen. It was moreover found that the lower the electricity consumption of the electrolyzer, the higher the value assumed by the emission factor from the electricity grid, which makes the use of hydrogen convenient.

AB Zr-4 alloy is widely used as fuel cladding in the nuclear industry. And welding is one of the most significant procedures during the manufacturing of fuel assembly. Bonding at high temperature risks safe operation of nuclear reactors because high temperature deteriorates the properties of Zr-4 alloy. Herein, Zr-4 alloy was hydrogenated to a hydrogen content of 0.2 wt.% before diffusion bonding. Direct diffusion bonding of hydrogenated Zr-4 alloy was performed at various bonding temperatures. The microstructural evolution of the bonding interface and the interface bonding mechanism were systematically investigated. The bonding temperature of the hydrogenated Zr-4 alloy was reduced by 150 degrees C compared with the corresponding nonhydrogenated alloy. Furthermore, the shear strength of the joints was as high as 257 MPa (4.6 x higher than corresponding joints comprised of the non-hydrogenated alloy) at a bonding temperature of 700 degrees C. Transmission electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction indicate that plastic deformation of the joints increased because of a phase transition of the hydrides (to the b-Zr phase) during bonding, leading to high-density dislocations that accumulated at the bonding interface. The migration of the interface grain boundary was facilitated by high-density dislocations of sufficiently high energy. The bonding interface was no longer evident, enabled by dynamic recrystallization induced by migration of the interface grain boundary. Furthermore, the fracture mode of the joints was initially brittle but became ductile/brittle mixed mode with increasing temperature.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The aggregation behaviors of a series of heterogemini surfactants N,N-dimethyl-N-[3-(alkyloxy)-2-hydroxypropyl]-alkylammonium bromide, abbreviated as CmOhpNCn (m, n = 10, 8; 10, 14; 12, 8; 12, 10; 12, 12; 12, 14; 14, 8 and 14, 10), have been investigated in aqueous solution. Electric conductivity, steady-state and frequency sweep rheological measurements were adopted to study the micellar morphology affected by molecular structure, concentration and temperature, and a close relationship among them was established. Electric conductivity measurement results indicated that Krafft temperatures were mainly related to the total number of carbon atoms, while the CMC values were affected by the combined factors of alkyl chain length, degree of dissymmetry and hydroxyl head group. And some unusual values may come from the poor water solubility induced by the relatively long alkyl chain n. Dynamic rheological results and cryo-TEM images revealed various micellar behaviors of C-mOhpNC-8 affected by different combined factors. When m value was increased, the formation of quite long rodlike or wormlike micelles derived from the enhanced hydrophobility and hydrogen bonding. And the effect of concentration on aggregation behavior was similar to that of m value except for formation of micellar joints. With temperature increase, the decreased viscosity of C(14)OhpNC(8) was due to formation of micellar joints and weakening of hydrogen bonding, which could be confirmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS). Furthermore, the C(14)OhpNC(8) aggregates formed below the Krafft temperature were more likely to be affected by temperature at high concentrations.

AB The joint process of pyrolysis-steam reforming is a novel and promising strategy for hydrogen production from biomass; however, it is conditioned by the endothermicity of the reforming reaction and the fast catalyst deactivation. Oxygen addition may potentially overcome these limitations. A thermodynamic equilibrium approach using Gibbs free energy minimization method has been assumed for the evaluation of suitable conditions for the oxidative steam reforming (OSR) of biomass fast pyrolysis volatiles. The simulation has been carried out contemplating a wide range of reforming operating conditions, i.e., temperature (500-800 degrees C), steam/biomass (S/B) ratio (0-4) and equivalence ratio (ER) (0-0.2). It is to note that the simulation results under steam reforming (SR) conditions are consistent with those obtained by experiments. Temperatures between 600 and 700 degrees C, S/B ratios in the 2-3 range and ER values of around 0.12 are the optimum conditions for the OSR under autothermal reforming (ATR) conditions, as they allow attaining high hydrogen yields (10 wt% by mass unit of the biomass in the feed), which are only 12-15% lower than those obtained under SR conditions.

AB Objective: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a degenerative joint condition, leading to disability and diminished quality of life. Molecular hydrogen has been proven to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, but few studies have investigated its effects on osteoarthritis. Our study aims to assess the therapeutic potential of hydrogen-oxygen mixture (H2-O2) inhalation for KOA. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, eligible elderly KOA patients were randomly assigned to either Group H or Group C. Both groups participated in a 12-week home-based exercise (HBE) program, which included knee-joint exercises and health education. Group H additionally received H2-O2 inhalation for 60 min per day over 2 weeks, while Group C did not. The primary outcome was measured using Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Secondary outcomes included inflammation levels (hs-CRP, NLR, PLR, LMR), Chair Stand Test (CST), Timed Up and Go (TUG), 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36), Exercise Adherence Rating Scale (EARS), and adverse events. Results: A total of 121 subjects were enrolled, with an average age of 81.2 years, and 80.2% were female. The between-group mean difference in the WOMAC total score was -5.2 (95% CI -12.1 to 1.7, P = 0.140) at week 12, with Group H showing an improvement of -22.9 (95% CI -26.3 to -19.6, P < 0.001) and Group C showing an improvement of -19.4 (95% CI -22.7 to -16.0, P < 0.001) compared to baseline, revealing a significant group x time interaction (F (3, 356.034) = 14.425, P < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between both groups at week 12 in CST, TUG, SF-36 scores, EARS scores, or the incidence of adverse events. Conclusion: Although clinical significance was not achieved, H2-O2 inhalation alleviated KOA symptoms and enhanced functional activity in elderly patients undergoing the HBE program during the initial 2 weeks. However, its sustained effects on improving KOA symptoms were not observed.

AB The intergalactic helium became fully ionized by the end of cosmic noon (z similar to 2). Similarly to the reionization of hydrogen, helium reionization is expected to be patchy, driven by luminous quasars that ionize the intergalactic gas in their surrounding environment. Probing the morphology of ionized electrons during this epoch can provide crucial information about early structure formation, including the clustering and luminosities of quasars, the accretion rates, variability, and lifetimes of active galactic nuclei, as well as the growth and evolution of supermassive black holes. In this study, we present how measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) can be used to reconstruct the optical-depth fluctuations resulting from patchy helium reionization. As helium reionization occurred at lower redshifts, upcoming probes of large-scale structure surveys will present a significant opportunity to enhance the prospects of probing this epoch by their combined analysis with the CMB. Using a joint information-matrix analysis of hydrogen and helium reionization, we show that near-future galaxy and CMB surveys will have enough statistical power to detect optical-depth fluctuations due to doubly-ionized helium, providing a way of measuring the redshift and duration of helium reionization to high significance. We also show that modeling uncertainties in helium reionization can impact the measurement precision of parameters characterizing hydrogen reionization.

AB Based on CoVs, the genomic structure is arranged in a +ssRNA with approximately 30 kb in length which is the biggest known RNA viruses including a 5'-cap structure and 3'-poly-A tail. CoVs, (positive stranded RNA viruses), can infect humans and multiple species of animals, cause enteric, respiratory, and central nervous system diseases in many species. These viruses are important for anti-CoV drug delivery through a pivotal function in viral gene expression and replication through the proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins. In this paper, it has been illustrated the linkage of 6 inhibitors of N4[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]methyl]1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide, "inh1", NSC 158362, "inh2", JMF 1586 ,"inh3",(N-(2-aminoethyl)-1-1 zirid ine-ethanamine) , "inh4" ,[(Z)-1-thiophen-2ylethylideneamino]thiourea, "inh5" and Vanillinbananin, "inh6", to CoVs by forming the complexes of "inhibitor- CoV" in water phase through the H-bonding using some physico-chemical properties including heat of formation , Gibbs free energy , electronic energy , charge distribution of active parts in the hydrogen bonding ,NMR estimation of inhibitor jointed to the database amino acids fragment of Tyr-Met-His as the selective zone of the CoV, positive frequency and intensity of different normal modes of these structures.The theoretical calculations were done at various levels of theory in water simulated medium to gain the more accurate equilibrium geometrical results, and infrared spectral data for each of the complex proposed drugs of N-terminal or O-terminal auto-cleavage substrate were individually determined to elucidate the structural flexibility and substrate binding of six inhibitors including jointed to TMH, inh[1-6]-TMH. A comparison of these structures with two configurations provides new insights for the design of substrate-based inhibitors targeting CoV. This indicates a feasible model for designing wide-spectrum inhibitors against CoV-associated diseases.The structure-based optimization of these structures has yielded two more efficacious lead compounds, N and O atoms through forming the hydrogen bonding (hydrogen-bonding) with potent inhibition against CoV (Tyr160-Met161-His162) because of water polar medium which has been abbreviated as TMH in this paper.

AB This study has investigated the joint effect of several mix parameters on the properties of foam geopolymers. The mix parameters analysed through a laboratory experiment of 54 different mortar mixes were, sodium silicate/sodium hydroxide mass ratio (2.5, 3.5, 4.5), activator/binder mass ratio (0.6, 0.8, 1.0), chemical foaming agent type (hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium perborate (NaBO3)) and foaming agent mass ratio content (1%, 2%, 3%). Properties, SEM and FTIR analysis and cost analysis are included. The results show that the sodium perborate over performs hydrogen peroxide leading to a lower overall thermal conductibility of foam geopolymers. Mixtures with a low thermal conductivity of around 0.1 W/(m.K) and a compressive strength of around 6 MPa were achieved. The cost analysis show that the foaming agents are responsible for a small percentage of foam geopolymers total cost being that the alkaline activators are responsible for more than 80%.

AB Precise characterization of archetypal systems of aqueous hydrogen-bonding networks is essential for developing accurate potential functions and universal models of water. The structures of water clusters (H2O)(n) (n = 2-9) have been verified recently through size-specific infrared spectroscopy with a vacuum ultraviolet free electron laser (VUV-FEL) and quantum chemical studies. For (H2O)(10), the pentagonal prism and butterfly motifs were proposed to be important building blocks and were observed in previous experiments. Here we report the size-specific infrared spectra of (H2O)(10) via a joint experimental and theoretical study. Well-resolved spectra provide a unique signature for the coexistence of pentagonal prism and butterfly motifs. These (H2O)(10) motifs develop from the dominant structures of (H2O)(n) (n = 8, 9) clusters. This work provides an intriguing prelude to the diverse structure of liquid water and opens avenues for size-dependent measurement of larger systems to understand the stepwise formation mechanism of hydrogen-bonding networks.

AB Ammonia is not only the most important chemical for fertilizer production, it has also gained much interest as a future hydrogen storage material. Besides the well-known Haber-Bosch process to generate ammonia from elemental sources, new ways to convert nitrogen into ammonia have been investigated in the last decade for a decentralized production, including electrocatalytic and photocatalytic approaches. However, photocatalysis in particular suffers from stagnating materials development and unstandardized reaction conditions. In this Review, we shine light on recent materials and reaction engineering results for photocatalytic nitrogen reduction, putting an emphasis on the need to connect the activity of reported materials together with detailed reaction conditions and efficiencies. Photocatalytic nitrogen reduction is an emerging field that will certainly gain significant interest in the future as a sustainable pathway to generate green hydrogen and ammonia.

AB This study systematically investigates the fracture behavior of X80 pipeline steel welded joints under hydrogen-induced cracking (HIC) conditions through combined experimental characterization and numerical simulation. Microstructural observations and Vickers hardness testing reveal significant heterogeneity in the base metal, heat-affected zone (HAZ), and weld metal (WM), resulting in spatially non-uniform mechanical properties. A user-defined subroutine (USDFLD) was employed to assign continuous material property distributions within the finite element model, accurately capturing mechanical heterogeneity and its influence on crack-tip mechanical fields and crack propagation paths. Results show that welding thermal cycles induce pronounced microstructural evolution, significantly altering hardness and strength distributions, which in turn affect the evolution of crack-tip stress and plastic strain fields. Crack propagation preferentially occurs toward regions of higher yield strength, where limited plasticity leads to intensified crack-tip stress concentration, accelerating crack growth and extending propagation paths. Moreover, crack growth is accompanied by local unloading near the crack tip, reducing peak stress and strain compared to the initial stationary crack tip. The stress and strain field reconfiguration are primarily localized near the crack tip, while the far-field mechanical response remains largely stable.

AB This study develops a Janus-structured hydrogel sensor (P(AA-co-PNIPAM/CDs)) through template-assisted copolymerization of acrylic acid and N-isopropylacrylamide with dopamine-cellulose carbon dots (CDs). The hydrogel demonstrates temperature-responsive strain sensing regulation and enhanced interfacial adhesion, achieving remarkable peel strengths of 237.8 N m-1 (air, 25 degrees C) and 42.7 N m-1 (water, 50 degrees C). CD incorporation improves conductivity (1.219 mS cm-1) while reinforcing dynamic adhesion through hydrogen bonding and pi-pi interactions. The dual-responsive hydrogel exhibits exceptional joint motion monitoring capabilities across diverse environments, maintaining a stable electrical signal output during repetitive stretching (100% strain). Its temperature-modulated underwater adhesion and strain-sensitive conductivity enable the precise detection of both macroscopic movements (joint flexion) and subtle physiological signals (pulse waves). These synergistic properties position P(AA-co-PNIPAM/CDs) as a promising candidate for next-generation smart sensors in athletic monitoring and aquatic robotics, particularly in addressing challenges in underwater wearable electronics and adaptive human-machine interfaces.

AB The effects of various organic additives, such as diethanolamine (DEA) and ethanolamine (EA), and variations in aging times on the formation and stability mechanisms of spherical aggregates of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) prepared by using solvothermal synthesis were studied. The experimental results of the structural, morphological and optical properties monitored by using X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and UV-Vis spectroscopy were supported by quantum chemical calculations at the level of density functional theory (DFT). Understanding the mechanism of spherical ZnO aggregate formation and its stability by mimicking the processes at the computer level was achieved through theoretical simulations of the ZnO surface/additive interactions using (ZnO)(36)-DEA and (ZnO)(36)-EA models. The fine-tuned spherical aggregation of ZnO nanoparticles was driven by various interactions, in particular, strong O-H & BULL;& BULL;& BULL;O and weak N-H & BULL;& BULL;& BULL;O hydrogen bonds as controlling interactions. The calculated negative free release energy, increment G*(INT), indicates that the ZnO surface/additive interaction in diethanolamine media is a spontaneous exergonic process ( increment G*(INT) = -7.73 kcal mol(-1)), whereas, in ethanolamine media, it is an unfavorable, slightly endergonic process ( increment G*(INT) > 0). The presence of two strong O-H & BULL;& BULL;& BULL;O hydrogen bonds and, at the same time, a weaker N-H & BULL;& BULL;& BULL;O hydrogen bond is the key factor for the very good and long-term aggregate stability of ZnO NPs in DEA media. This integrated experimental-theoretical study highlights the stability and compactness of spherical ZnO aggregates of ZnO NPs, prepared in the presence of diethanolamine compared to ethanolamine media, and provides a promising method and flexible design of ZnO nanomaterials to improve their adsorptive and optical properties.

AB The main objective of the study was to assess if joint application of melatonin (MT, 0.1 mM) and salicylic acid (SA 0.5 mM) could improve tolerance of pepper plants to arsenic (As) as sodium hydrogen arsenate heptahydrate (0.05 mM). The imposition of arsenic stress led to accumulation of As in roots and leaves, and increased contents of leaf proline, phytochelatins, malondialdehyde (MDA) and H2O2, but it reduced plant biomass, chlorophylls (Chl), PSII maximum efficiency (Fv/Fm) and leaf water potential. Melatonin and SA applied jointly or alone enhanced nitrogen metabolism by triggering the activities of glutamate synthase, glutamine synthetase, and nitrite reductases and nitrate. In comparison with a single treatment of MT or SA, the joint treatment of MT and SA had better impact on enhancing growth and key biological events and decreasing tissue As content. This clearly shows a cooperative function of both agents in enhancing tolerance to As-toxicity in pepper plants.

AB A major goal of energy research is to use visible light to cleave water directly, without an applied voltage, into hydrogen and oxygen. Although SrTiO3 requires ultraviolet light, after four decades, it is still the "gold standard" for the photo-catalytic splitting of water. It is chemically robust and can carry out both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions without an applied bias. While ultrahigh vacuum surface science techniques have provided useful insights, we still know relatively little about the structure of these electrodes in contact with electrolytes under operating conditions. Here, we report the surface structure evolution of a n-SrTiO3 electrode during water splitting, before and after "training" with an applied positive bias. Operando high-energy X-ray reflectivity measurements demonstrate that training the electrode irreversibly reorders the surface. Scanning electrochemical microscopy at open circuit correlates this training with a 3-fold increase of the activity toward the photo-induced water splitting. A novel first-principles joint density functional theory simulation, constrained to the X-ray data via a generalized penalty function, identifies an anatase-like structure as the more active, trained surface.

TI Collaborative scheduling and benefit allocation for waste-to-energy,

DT Article
DE Collaborative scheduling; Benefit allocation; Waste-driven renewable
   energy system; temporal relevance; Improved aumann-shapley value method
AB Waste-to-energy (WTE) is a technology that converts inexhaustible waste into electricity, thus significantly alleviating energy crisis. Integrating hydrogen storage into WTE provides an effective way to store and utilize surplus electricity from WTE on-site (by producing hydrogen). Additionally, integrating power-to-gas (P2G) into WTE provides an effective way to reduce CO2 emission from WTE on-site (by producing natural gas). To this end, a novel waste-driven renewable energy system (WRES), which is consisted of WTE, hydrogen storage, and P2G, has been proposed. However, the uncertain waste supply and electrical load markedly interfere with WRES operation. Meanwhile, when WTE, hydrogen storage, and P2G belong to different agents, the collaborative benefit from WRES operation should be rationally allocated among agents for system sustainability. This paper endeavors to achieve WRES scheduling and collaborative benefit allocation for WTE, hydrogen storage, and P2G under uncertainties. Firstly, a temporal relevance based distributionally robust optimization model is proposed for WRES scheduling under uncertainties, in which the possible range of the joint distribution for uncertainties is depicted by data covariance matrices involved ambiguity set. Secondly, collaborative benefit is allocated according to WTE, hydrogen storage, and P2G contributions, in which Gauss-Legendre quadrature formula is integrated with Aumann-Shapley value method to reduce calculation complexity. Finally, simulation results show that 1) the proposed scheduling model guarantees the economic and stable operation of WRES under uncertainties. 2) after considering the temporal relevance, WRES operation benefit is 8.35 % higher, which indicates that the proposed scheduling model has superiority in decision conservatism by introducing temporal relevance to remove impractical distributions in ambiguity set. 3) the proposed allocation model rationally distributes the collaborative benefit according to contributions, and presents lower calculation complexity, e.g., the calculation time is 95.52 % lower than the Shapely value method. This paper provides policy insights to promote widespread application and sustainable operation of WRES.

AB The 1:1 complex of tert-butyl alcohol with difluoromethane has been characterized by means of a joint experimental-computational investigation. Its rotational spectrum has been recorded by using a pulsed jet Fourier-Transform microwave spectrometer. The experimental work has been guided and supported by accurate quantum-chemical calculations. In particular, the computed potential energy landscape pointed out the formation of three stable isomers. However, the very low interconversion barriers explain why only one isomer, showing one O-H center dot center dot center dot F and two C-H center dot center dot center dot O weak hydrogen bonds, has been experimentally characterized. The effect of the H tert-butyl-group substitution has been analyzed from the comparison to the difluoromethane-water adduct. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Neutron crystallography is a powerful method to determine the positions of H atoms in macromolecular structures. However, it is sometimes hard to judge what would constitute a chemically reasonable model, and the geometry of H atoms depends more on the surroundings (for example the formation of hydrogen bonds) than heavy atoms, so that the empirical geometry information for the H atoms used to supplement the experimental data is often less accurate. These problems may be reduced by using quantum-mechanical calculations. A method has therefore been developed to combine quantum-mechanical calculations with joint crystallographic refinement against X-ray and neutron data. A first validation of this method is provided by re-refining the structure of the galectin-3 carbohydrate-recognition domain in complex with lactose. The geometry is improved, in particular for water molecules, for which the method leads to better-resolved hydrogen-bonding interactions. The method has also been applied to the active copper site of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase and shows that the protonation state of the amino-terminal histidine residue can be determined.

AB The effects of micro-mixer pattern, volumetric flow ratio, capillary length, inner diameter of capillary, residence time, and phenol concentration on phenol microfluidic extraction were investigated. The results indicated that the extraction performances of phenol with Y-shape joint were higher than that with T-shape joint. The smaller inner diameter of capillary could improve extraction performances of phenol. The phenol concentration of the inlet in aqueous phase had slight influence on phenol microfluidic extraction. The inner diameter of capillary of 1.0 mm, volumetric flow ratio of 1:1, capillary length of 2 m, and residence time of 88.3 s were more suitable for extraction of phenol. The overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient of phenol reached 0.0036 s-1 at residence time of 8.8 s. The extraction efficiency of phenol realized 99% at residence time of 23.6 s. The extraction of phenol from aqueous solution depended on intermolecular forces and hydrogen bonds between MIBK and phenol.

AB A joint protection system is proposed, replace the auxiliary anode in impressed current cathodic protection with DSA anode with chlorine evolution ability, and perform electrolytic seawater antifouling while performing impressed current cathodic protection. The results of electrochemical impedance tests are used in conjunction with the relationship between the material hardness and degree of hydrogen embrittlement to determine that the cathodic protection potential range is -0.85 V- -1.17 V (vs. SCE). An effective chlorine detection electrode is used to detect the concentration and diffusion of effective chlorine in the anode region of the combined protection system, where the potential range for chlorine production by the anode is 1.85 V-2 V (vs. SCE). The anode and cathode potentials are adjusted to conduct a comparative experiment on corrosion and biological adhesion on the surface of Q345 carbon steel treated with joint protection in marine environments. The surface morphology of the experimental samples is analyzed. The experimental results reveal joint protection prevents corrosion of the surface of the Q345 carbon steel as well as fouling or biological attachment. A white calcium-magnesium deposition layer forms on the substrate surface. For the Q345 carbon steel treated with ICCP alone, there are very clear signs of biological adhesion on the surface, the substrate under the deposition layer is clearly corroded, and the deposition layer appears yellow because of the adhesion of a large quantity of organic matter. A comparative analysis of the experimental results leads to the conclusion that the combined application of electrolytic seawater antifouling and ICCP to Q345 carbon steel can simultaneously prevent electrochemical corrosion and marine fouling by biological adhesion.

AB Hydrogels have broad application prospects in biomedicine, energy, and tissue engineering due to their high water content, adjustable physicochemical properties, and flexibility. In general, the poor stretchability and adhesion of hydrogels limit their application in flexible wearable electronics. In this work, a composite hydrogel (GM hydrogel) with excellent adhesion, stretchability, and conductivity was prepared by a one-pot synthesis process through the hydrogen-bonding interaction between P(AM-co-AA)) and gallic acid (GA). Natural plant polyphenol GA not only enhances the mechanical properties of the hydrogel (maximum tensile strain of 890% and maximum tensile stress of 238 kPa) but also gives the hydrogel adhesion (9 kPa). GM hydrogel can be further used to construct strain sensors and self-powered sensors. GM hydrogel strain sensors can be attached to finger joints to monitor and distinguish the angles of finger joint bending. Self-powered sensors based on GM hydrogels can stably transmit encrypted signals. Therefore, multifunctional GM hydrogels can be used for electronic skin, human motion monitoring, and wearable biosensors.

AB Osteoarthritis patients often experience pain and inflammation in joints. To understand whether antioxidant supplements could reduce inflammation and could potentially be applied for osteoarthritis treatment, vitamin E and resveratrol were investigated in this study. Hydrogen peroxide was used for inducing inflammation in porcine chondrocytes, and the lumen density was measured for the level of oxygen-derived free radicals. In total, 5, 50, 100, and 200 mu M of vitamin E and resveratrol were analyzed for cell viability and the effect of lumen density. In addition, the expressions of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, MMP-1, MMP-13, and COL2A1 were investigated when treating chondrocytes with 100 mu M vitamin E, 5 mu M resveratrol, or their combination before or after hydrogen peroxide induction. Inducing chondrocytes with hydrogen peroxide for 30 min increased the level of lumen density sufficiently and stimulated the expression of inflammatory genes. All the concentrations of vitamin E and resveratrol showed good cell viability. Single treatment with either vitamin E or resveratrol reduced inflammatory gene expression, and combined treatment increased the expression of collagen type II. The results suggested that post-treatment with both vitamin E and resveratrol has a better effect on the reduction in inflammation in osteoarthritis-like chondrocytes.

AB Considering the specific wind and photovoltaic power characteristics of a certain region, this study investigates the optimal ratio of Alkaline Electrolysis Cells (AEL) to Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzers in a hybrid electrolysis system for hydrogen production. A flexible model for configuring the hybrid electrolysis system is proposed, based on a copula function for joint wind and solar power modeling. This model generates wind and photovoltaic power generation scenarios using the copula function, incorporating a selection mechanism to ensure that the output scenarios are more representative of the actual data characteristics of wind and photovoltaic power output. Consequently, considering both the fluctuation and amplitude, the wind and photovoltaic power data are decomposed using the Ensemble empirical mode decomposition method. The decomposed components are then allocated to the two types of electrolyzers. Furthermore, the optimal configuration of the hybrid electrolysis system is determined by minimizing the costs associated with wasted power, electricity purchases, and other expenses. Finally, a case study of a 100 MW wind farm and a 50 MW photovoltaic power station in Northwest China is presented, concluding that the optimal configuration ratio of AEL to PEM electrolyzers is 2:1. In a Matlab/Simulink platform, the performance metrics of the hybrid electrolysis system were validated. It was found that the hydrogen production rate of the hybrid electrolyzer is comparable to that of the PEM electrolyzer, but with a lower required cost. Additionally, the hydrogen production rate and volume of the optimal configuration for the hybrid electrolyzer determined by the model proposed in this paper are higher than those obtained through the optimization algorithm's optimal configuration.

AB The influences of caffeine, lysozyme and the joint application of them on the hepatoma cell line HepG2 proliferation inhibition and cell apoptosis were observed by 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay and Hoechst 33342, which showed the proliferation inhibition rate of the joint application on HepG2 cells was 47.21%, significantly higher than caffeine or lysozyme, and the joint application promoted the apoptosis of HepG2 cells obviously. Van't Hoff classical thermodynamics formula, the Foster theory of non radiation energy transfer and fluorescence phase diagram were used to manifest that the process of lysozyme binding to caffeine followed a two-state model, which was spontaneous at low temperature driven by enthalpy change, and the predominant intermolecular force was hydrogen bonding or Van der Waals force to stabilize caffeine-lysozyme complex with the distance 5.86 nm. The attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectra indicated that caffeine decreased the relative contents of alpha-helix and beta-turn, which inferred the structure of lysozyme tended to be "loose". Synchronous fluorescence spectra and ultraviolet spectra supported the above conclusion. The amino acid residues in the cleft of lysozyme were exposed and electropositivity was increased attributing to the loose structure, which were conducive to increasing caffeine concentration on the HepG2 cell surface by electrostatic interaction to show synergistic effect.

AB Expansion joint failure is one of the main causes that lead to the damages of concrete pavement. The silicon dioxide/shape memory polyurethane (SiO2/SMPU) is a new kind of sealant which can use its shape memory performance to adapt to the width of the expansion joint with the change of pavement temperature, and it can effectively prolong the service life of the pavement and reduce maintenance costs. In this study, the effects of programming and the addition of SiO2 particles to the thermodynamic properties of the specimens were detected using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the optimal shape memory programming temperature of which is 72.9 degrees C. Combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and shape memory effect test, the particles are evenly distributed between the two phases, and the shape fixation rate (R-f) of 98.15% and the shape recovery rate (R-r) of 97.31% show that the composite has a good shape memory effect. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and dynamic infrared dichroism illustrate the change of the hydrogen bond of soft and hard segments with the SiO2 particles in the shape memory cycle, revealing the optimal shape memory programming process. This study provides an insight into the reinforcement mechanism of SiO2 nanoparticles in SMPU matrix and verify whether it can meet the engineering requirements of expansion joints when used as a sealant of concrete pavement.

AB In this work, the dynamic behavior of glass transition in a miscible blend of Poly (vinyl phenol) (PVPh)/ Poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) with a mass ratio of 3:1 (PVPh/PEO 75/25) were studied within a joint way of experimental and theoretical methods. The results showed the evidence for the influence of hydrogen bonding (HB) and Van der Waals (VdW) interaction between PVPh and PEO on the dynamic behavior in glass transition. The results reported here allows the opportunities for finding new blend dependent on this kind of interaction or design of special polymers to enhance such interactions.

AB We report the size-dependent activity and stability of supported Pt-1,Pt-4,Pt-7,Pt-8 for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction, and show that clusters outperform polycrystalline Pt in activity, with size-dependent stability. To understand the size effects, we use DFT calculations to study the structural fluxionality under varying potentials. We show that the clusters can reshape under H coverage and populate an ensemble of states with diverse stoichiometry, structure, and thus reactivity. Both experiment and theory suggest that electrocatalytic species are hydridic states of the clusters (2 H/Pt). An ensemble-based kinetic model reproduces the experimental activity trend and reveals the role of metastable states. The stability trend is rationalized by chemical bonding analysis. Our joint study demonstrates the potential- and adsorbate-coverage-dependent fluxionality of subnano clusters of different sizes and offers a systematic modeling strategy to tackle the complexities.

AB Background: Facet joint degeneration (FJD), which is also called facet joint syndrome (FJS), has become one of the most commonly seen etiological factors for lumbago. Cartilage lesion triggered by lumbar facet joint (LFJ) degeneration might be related to mitochondria! impairment, but the its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Materials and methods: The endplate chondrocytes were induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to mimic the pathological conditions of oxidative stress. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used for the evaluation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) level was assessed using ATP detection, along with the detection the expression of cytochrome C in mitochondria (mito-cyt c) and in cell cytoplasm (cyto-cyt c) and cleaved caspase 3 by Western blot analysis. TUNEL assay was conducted for the measurement of cell apoptosis in endplate chondrocytes. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to verify the expression of heat shock protein 22 (HSP22) and the transfection efficiency of HSP22 interference plasmid. Results. It was found that H2O2 promoted the mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS generation and cell apoptosis in endplate chondrocytes. Moreover, HSP22 was down-regulated in H2O2 -induced endplate chondrocytes, and interference of HSP22 decreased the ROS production, increased the ATP level and promoted the cell apoptosis, resulting in the enhanced impairment of endplate chondrocytes. Additionally, mitochondrial ROS inhibitor (Mito-TEMPO) ameliorated the injury effects of HSP22 silencing in the H2O2 -induced endplate chondrocytes. Conclusion: In conclusion, HSP22 inhibits oxidative stress-induced endplate chondrocyte apoptosis by regulating mitochondrial pathway, possibly providing novel guidance direction for the treatment of LFJ degeneration.

AB Scalable and sustainable solar hydrogen production via photocatalytic water splitting requires extremely active and stable light-harvesting semiconductors to fulfill the stringent requirements of suitable energy band position and rapid interfacial charge transfer process. Motivated by this point, increasing attention has been given to the development of photocatalysts comprising intimately interfaced photoabsorbers and cocatalysts. Herein, a simple one-step approach is reported to fabricate a high-efficiency photocatalytic system, in which single-site dispersed iron atoms are rationally integrated on the intrinsic structure of the porous crimped graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) polymer. A detailed analysis of the formation process shows that a stable complex is generated by spontaneously coordinating dicyandiamidine nitrate with iron ions in isopropanol, thus leading to a relatively complicated polycondensation reaction upon thermal treatment. The correlation of experimental and computational results confirms that optimized electronic structures of Fe@g-C3N4 with an appropriate d-band position and negatively shifting Fermi level can be achieved, which effectively gains the reducibility of electrons and creates more active sites for the photocatalytic reactions. As a result, the Fe@g-C3N4 exhibits a highlighted intramolecular synergistic effect, performing greatly enhanced solar-photon-driven activities, including excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate (3390 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), lambda > 420 nm) and a reliable apparent quantum efficiency value of 6.89% at 420 nm.

AB The rotational spectrum of the binary adduct of formamide (HCONH2) with dimethyl sulfide (DMS) has been investigated employing cavity-based Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy combined with theoretical computations. Experimentally, only one isomer of the adduct was unambiguously observed and assigned according to the theoretically predicted spectroscopic parameters, and its rotational spectrum displays the hyperfine splittings associated with the N-14 nuclear quadrupole coupling effect. The observed isomer exhibits C s symmetry, such that the LCSC angle of the DMS subunit is bisected by the ab-plane of the HCONH2 moiety. The two moieties in the detected isomer are connected via one primary N-H center dot center dot center dot S and two secondary C-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds. Quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), non-covalent interaction (NCI), natural bond orbital (NBO) and symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) approaches were utilized for characterizing the intermolecular interactions occurring in the titled adduct. Additionally, the adduct of HCONH2 with dimethyl ether (DME) was also theoretically investigated to compare the difference in structure and energy characteristics between the N-H center dot center dot center dot S and N-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds.

AB Hydrogen sensors combining wide detection range and high response, that can operate at room temperature, are urgently demanded for monitoring different concentrations of hydrogen on a single device. Here, a novel onestep hydrothermal method is reported to construct Nb doped rutile/anatase TiO2 heterophase junctions for a highly sensitive H-2 sensor. The Nb concentration in the solvent plays an important role for the heterophase juncton self-assemble, and the reaction time determines the surface morphology giving either a ruffle TiO2 nanorod decorated anatase form, or a Nb doped rutile/anatase TiO2 bi-layer structure. An inverse dependence of the detectivity on H-2 concentration is obtained as theoretically predicted but previously not experimentally verified for the high concentration region at low temperatures. The H-2 concentration detection range is remarkably expanded, extending from 1 ppm to 12000 ppm for nanorod decorated film. The H-2 response at 1 ppm is significantly enhanced to 22.5%, and reaches 98.9% in 8000 ppm H-2 for the bilayer structure. The remarkablely extended detection range is the result of the massive accumulation of reactive pre-absorbed O-2(-) on the surface due to the Nb doping, and the significantly enhanced response at room temperature results from the joint contributions of pre-absorbed O-2(-), film compactness and the heterophase junction. Moreover, Nb doped rutile/anatase TiO2 heterophase juncton films show high stability and humidity resistance for hydrogen sensing.

AB Bonding evolution theory (BET), as a combination of the electron localization function (ELF) and Thoms catastrophe theory (CT), has been coupled with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method in order to study biochemical reaction paths. The evolution of the bond breaking/forming processes and electron pair rearrangements in an inhomogeneous dynamic environment provided by the enzyme has been elucidated. The proposed methodology is applied in an enzymatic system in order to clarify the reaction mechanism for the hydrogen abstraction of the androstenedione (ASD) substrate catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 aromatase enzyme. The use of a QM/MM Hamiltonian allows inclusion of the polarization of the charges derived from the amino acid residues in the wave function, providing a more accurate and realistic description of the chemical process. The hydrogen abstraction step is found to have five different ELF structural stability domains, whereas the C-H breaking and O-H forming bond process rearrangements are taking place in an asynchronous way.

AB A joint experimental and theoretical investigation of the valence-shell excitations of hydrogen has been performed by the high-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering and electron scattering as well as the multireference single- and double-excitation configuration-interaction method. Momentum-transfer-dependent inelastic squared form factors for the vibronic series belonging to the B (1)Sigma(+)(u), C (1)Pi(u), and E F (1)Sigma(+)(g) electronic states of molecular hydrogen have been derived from the inelastic x-ray scattering method at an impact photon energy around 10 keV, and the electron energy-loss spectra measured at an incident electron energy of 1500 eV. It is found that both the present and the previous calculations cannot satisfactorily reproduce the inelastic squared form-factor profiles for the higher vibronic transitions of the B (1)Sigma(+)(u) state of molecular hydrogen, which may be due to the electronic-vibrational coupling for the higher vibronic states. For the C (1)Pi(u) state and some vibronic excitations of E F (1)Sigma(+)(g) state, the present experimental results are in good agreement with the present and previous calculations, while the slight differences between the inelastic x-ray scattering and electron energy-loss spectroscopy results in the larger squared momentum-transfer region may be attributed to the increasing role of the higher-order Born terms in the electron-scattering process.

AB Although it is widely recognized that even small amounts of hydrogen (H) can cause embrittlement in iron (Fe) and in (high-strength) steels, the fundamental mechanisms that cause it are not yet completely understood. To contribute to a better understanding of the behavior of H in metals, we use parallel replica dynamics (PRD) to study the effect that different amounts of atomic H have in the diffusion of a single vacancy in body-centered cubic (BCC) Fe. Using PRD we calculate the diffusion of H-vacancy complexes at temperatures and timescales that are not reachable using classical methods. Additionally, based on the PRD results and calculations of the minimum energy paths of migration, we propose a mechanism for the migration of vacancy-H complexes and formulate an analytical model for the calculation of their joint diffusivity.

AB We report on Bayesian estimation of the radius, mass, and hot surface regions of the massive millisecond pulsar PSR J0740+6620, conditional on pulse-profile modeling of Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer X-ray Timing Instrument event data. We condition on informative pulsar mass, distance, and orbital inclination priors derived from the joint North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves and Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment/Pulsar wideband radio timing measurements of Fonseca et al. We use XMM-Newton European Photon Imaging Camera spectroscopic event data to inform our X-ray likelihood function. The prior support of the pulsar radius is truncated at 16 km to ensure coverage of current dense matter models. We assume conservative priors on instrument calibration uncertainty. We constrain the equatorial radius and mass of PSR J0740+6620 to be 12.39(-0.98)(+1.30) km and 2.072(-0.066)(+0.067) M-circle dot respectively, each reported as the posterior credible interval bounded by the 16% and 84% quantiles, conditional on surface hot regions that are non-overlapping spherical caps of fully ionized hydrogen atmosphere with uniform effective temperature; a posteriori, the temperature is log(10)(T[K]) = 5.99(-0.06)(+0.05) for each hot region. All software for the X-ray modeling framework is open-source and all data, model, and sample information is publicly available, including analysis notebooks and model modules in the Python language. Our marginal likelihood function of mass and equatorial radius is proportional to the marginal joint posterior density of those parameters (within the prior support) and can thus be computed from the posterior samples.

AB The vibrational dynamics of the OH stretching mode in Ba(ClO4)(2) trihydrate are investigated by means of femtosecond infrared spectroscopy. The sample offers plane cyclic water trimers in the solid phase that feature virtually no hydrogen bond interaction between the water molecules. Selective excitation of the symmetric and asymmetric stretching leads to fast population redistribution, while simultaneous excitation yields quantum beats, which are monitored via a combination tone that dominates the overtone spectrum. The combination of steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy with quantum chemical simulations and general theoretical considerations gives indication of various aspects of symmetry breakage. The system shows a joint population lifetime of 8 ps and a long-lived coherence between symmetric and asymmetric stretching, which decays with a time constant of 0.6 ps. Published by AIP Publishing.

AB Healthy synovial fluids (SFs) are complex fluids consisting of biopolymers, globule proteins, and lipids and regarded as superlubricants to provide nearly life-long low friction and wear protection of synovial joints in mammals. In this paper, we report that the intricate lubricious mixture can be simulated by the aggregation of hyaluronic acid (HA) and hydrogel particles in aqueous suspensions. In the HA aqueous suspensions added with synthetic polymer microgels, we have effectively captured the bulk rheological properties of healthy SFs. It is also confirmed by light scattering and fluorescence microscopic characterization that added hydrogel particles can enhance the HA network by hydrogel-mediated hydrogen bonding, leading to the fractal HA-hydrogel aggregating networks in aqueous suspensions. The potential application of HA-hydrogel particle aggregates as biomimetic superlubricants is supported by the comparable low friction at high load to that of healthy SFs.

AB Constructing the heterostructure with noble metals on semiconductors is recognized as a prospective approach to enhance hydrogen generation. In this study, Au-Cu2O heterostructure particles (HPs) with unique inter-embedded heterostructures were controllably fabricated by a universal reaction between Cu particles and HAuCl4 solution. Besides, the boosted catalytic performance from the plasmon effects, Au-Cu2O inter-embedded heterostructure exhibits additional structural advantages to promote the photocatalytic property of hydrogen generation overall water splitting. Under the visible light, the H-2 evolution rate of the Au-Cu2O HPs is 152 and 22 times higher than that of pure Cu2O and traditional Cu2O@Au HPs with Au anchored on the surface of Cu2O, respectively. On one hand, inter-embedded heterostructure brings more contact areas as the active sites to carry out the direct electron transfer and electromagnetic transfer for the reduction. On the other hand, the finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations indicate that enhanced electromagnetic fields of Au-Cu2O HPs form a netlike structure to maximumly accelerate the transfer of hot electrons and separate the electron-hole pairs. Under the joint action of the two, the inter-embed heterostructure exhibits superior photocatalytic property, demonstrating that this study could instruct the design of other metal-semiconductor photocatalysts.

AB In this study, graphite (G) electrode was coated with nickel and decorated with silver nanoparticles (G/Ni/Ag) with the help of galvanostatic method, and electrodes were used as a cathode in alkaline water electrolysis system. The characterization was achieved using X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy. Hydrogen evolution performance of electrodes was investigated via cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, cathodic polarization curves, and electrochemical impedance measurements. Electrochemical results showed that hydrogen production efficiency significantly increased and charge transfer resistance decreased via G/Ni/Ag. The electrochemical water splitting performance of G/Ni/Ag, was established in a joint experimental and computational effort. Water and proton adsorption on Ag-decorated Ni surface were investigated using density functional theory. Electronic structure calculations identified the role of Ag adatom and Ni surface on water and proton adsorptions. From the computational studies, O in water was more reliable to adsorb at the bridge position of the Ag and Ni atoms, leading improved orbital overlap between H and Ni atoms and maximized chemical and physical interactions between the H2O molecules. Therefore, the Ag-decorated Ni(111) surface provides preferable adsorption site for the O atom in water and direct interactions between water Hs and available surface Ni atoms promote water dissociation.

AB This paper presents a novel long-term model for the joint expansion planning of power and hydrogen systems with short-term operational considerations. We propose linear reserve constraints with adjustable parameters within the planning model to address the reliability requirements from significant levels of variable renewable generation. These adjustable parameters are calibrated using an iterative training methodology that connects the long-term planning model with a short-term unit commitment model. A crucial aspect of our methodology is the iterative improvement of investment decisions through the feedback obtained by evaluating the operational performance of the investment decisions in different scenarios computed under the unit commitment model. Computational experiments in a case study of a large-scale Chilean power-hydrogen system show the effects of the proposed methodology on capacity expansion recommendations, where a correct balance between variable and flexible technologies is obtained. Moreover, when simulating the operation of the system for a full year, we observe that the proposed methodology generates an investment plan that achieves a lower total cost compared to other methodologies commonly used in the literature. Additional experiments in 100% renewable scenarios show how conventional methodologies reaches levels of not-supplied-energy between 2%-7%, while the proposed methodology achieves less than 1% in the same metric.

AB We have systematically studied the hydrogen adsorption mechanism, hydrogen dissociation, and diffusion on the high-index experimentally-found Mg(10 (1) over bar3) surface and made comparisons with the low-index Mg(0001) surface, using density-functional theory calculations. Various possible H adsorption sites and structures on the high-index Mg(10 (1) over bar3) are considered with H coverage up to eight monolayers. Specifically, the hydrogen adsorption sequence is found to be A(1)-fcc, A(2)-fcc, A(1)-tetra II, A(2)-tetra II, A(3)-fcc, B-1-hcp, B-2-hcp and B-1-octa. The H-Mg-H trilayer with Mg1.60+ and H-0.(80-) is found to be very stable during initial H uptake, while the H electron gain of 0.8 e (i.e., H-0(.8)0-) is shown to be a reliable indicator of H-adsorbed Mg(10 (1) over bar3) stability. Interestingly, on the one hand, H-2 dissociation is the role step during H uptake on Mg(10 (1) over bar3) with an H-2 dissociation energy barrier of 0.87 eV, which is consistent with the value on the low-index Mg(0001) from previous first principle calculations. On the other hand, the H diffusion barriers along the closed-packed planes are lower than those perpendicular to the planes, verifying that more feasible diffusion paths are available on the high-index Mg(10 (1) over bar3). These theoretical findings rationalize the previous joint experimental finding that the high-index Mg(10 (1) over bar3) dramatically decreases H sorption temperatures, and provide an H adsorption mechanism on high-index Mg surface very different from that on low-index Mg(0001), thus improving the foundation of Mg-based hydrogen storage material designs.

AB This study conducts a finite element analysis (FEA) to assess the sealing performance of type IV hydrogen storage vessels, focusing specifically on the viscoelastic properties of the liner material. The analysis aims to quantify the impact of key parameters, including sealing interface design, O-ring pre-compression, and liner thickness, on overall sealing integrity. Through detailed modeling of the interactions among the metal boss, polymer liner, and sealing ring, the study shows that ignoring the viscoelastic response of the polymer liner can result in a significant underestimation of radial deformation, by a factor of 0.4-0.5. Furthermore, the increasing thickness of the liner wall in the vessel mouth area intensifies deformation within the sealing zone, thereby increasing the potential for leakage. The presence of an annular groove at the interface between the metal seat and polymer liner is critical for effective sealing, generating contact stresses that meet the operational requirements at 52 MPa. Moreover, the O-ring's sealing effectiveness is highly sensitive to the initial compression rate, achieving optimal performance at rates above 16%. These findings offer valuable insights for enhancing the reliability of component joints under high-pressure conditions, critical for ensuring the safety and operational efficiency of type IV hydrogen storage vessels.

AB The development of dual gasotransmitter donors can not only provide robust tools to investigate their subtle interplay under pathophysiological conditions but also optimize therapeutic efficacy. While conventional strategies are heavily dependent on multicomponent donors, we herein report an ultrasound-responsive water-soluble copolymer (PSHF) capable of releasing carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) based on single-component sulfur-substituted 3-hydroxyflavone (SHF) derivatives. Interestingly, sulfur substitution can not only greatly improve the ultrasound sensitivity but also enable the co-release of CO/H2S under mild ultrasound irradiation. The co-release of CO/H2S gasotransmitters exerts a bactericidal effect against Staphylococcus aureus and demonstrates anti-inflammatory activity in lipopolysaccharide-challenged macrophages. Moreover, the excellent tissue penetration of ultrasound irradiation enables the local release of CO/H2S in the joints of septic arthritis rats, exhibiting superior therapeutic efficacy without the need for any antibiotics.
   Sulfur-substituted 3-hydroxyflavone was successfully developed as a single-component ultrasound-responsive dual donor of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The co-release of CO/H2S gasotransmitters under mild ultrasound irradiation shows synergistic antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities, exhibiting unique therapeutic potential and outperforming conventional antibiotic treatment in a murine septic arthritis model.image

AB The durability of membrane electrodes, which are the core components of the Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), seriously affects the service life of the stack. Under the action of long-term low temperature, the gas diffusion layer at the entrance will be aged and its micro-porous layer structure will be destroyed, which will hinder the removal of liquid water and gas transport, so it is necessary to preheat the anode hydrogen. In the present study, the influence of different pitch ratio and diameter ratio on heat transfer of corrugated tube heat exchanger is simulated by means of thermal-fluid coupled numerical simulation and periodic unit model, the effects of coolant flow rate and temperature on the overall heat transfer performance were also studied. The validity of the simulation results is verified by experiments, and the effect of hydrogen preheating on the stack performance is also tested. The simulation results show that the corrugated joint will disturb the flow of hydrogen, which increases the temperature gradient along the radial direction of the main flow and enhances the heat transfer. When Re is lower than 4000, the friction factor decreases quickly and then gradually flattens out. Compared with 0.5 for bellows with a pitch ratio of 1, the friction factor increases by 17%. With the increase of Re, the j values of different pitch ratios differ greatly and decrease linearly. For every 5 cm increase in the length of the corrugated tube, the total heat exchange capacity is increased by about 20% , and the total heat transfer increases about 100 W with the increase of the coolant flow 0.04 kg/s.

AB A single crystal Dy3Al2(AlO4)(3) rare-earth nanogarnets were grown via a sol-gel combustion method using single fuel. The structure and purity of nanogarnets was confirmed by XRD analysis. The average crystallite sizes and the effective particle sizes were calculated by Scherrer and Hall-Williamson equations. The FTIR results clearly confirmed the formation of metal-oxygen and metal-metal bonds of the product. The morphological studies were affirmed the nanoscale formation of Dy3Al5O12 with approximately narrow distribution of the particles. The direct band gap energy of the nanogarnets was calculated using Tauc equation about 3.33 eV. To complement the experimental data, the structural and electronic properties were calculated using periodic density functional theory. The use of the Hubbard U parameter was used and improved the band gap to experimental values. Experimental and computational observations have rendered the Dy3Al5O12 nanogarnets can be suitable for hydrogen energy sorption. The electrochemical hydrogen storage capacity of Dy3Al5O12 was measured at about 3137 mAh/g after 15 cycles. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by persistent inflammation and progressive joint destruction. Recent data underscore oxidative stress as a primary factor in the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis, intensifying inflammatory processes and tissue damage via the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and compromised antioxidant defenses. Current therapies, including disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), primarily target immune dysregulation but fail to address oxidative stress, necessitating novel adjunctive treatment strategies. This review explores the potential of antioxidant-based therapies as complementary approaches to RA management. Natural compounds such as curcumin, resveratrol, sulforaphane, and propolis exhibit strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties by modulating redox-sensitive pathways, including nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappa B) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Nrf2)/heme oxygenase (HO-1). N-acetylcysteine (NAC) replenishes intracellular glutathione, enhancing cellular resilience against oxidative stress. Additionally, molecular hydrogen (H2) selectively neutralizes harmful ROS, reducing oxidative damage and inflammation. The role of vitamin supplementation (D, B12, C, and K) in regulating immune responses and protecting joint structures is also discussed. This review aims to evaluate the efficacy and potential clinical applications of antioxidant therapies in RA, emphasizing their role in mitigating oxidative damage and improving treatment outcomes. While preliminary findings are promising, further clinical trials are needed to establish standardized dosing, long-term safety, and their integration into current RA treatment protocols.

AB The paper presents an overview of advanced in situ diffraction studies as a highly valuable tool to probe the structure and reacting mechanisms of hydrogen and energy storage materials. These studies offer benefits from the use of a high flux diffraction beam in combination with high resolution measurements, and allow, even when using very small samples, establishing the mechanism of the phase-structural transformations and their kinetics based on a rapid data collection for the various charge-discharge states at variable test conditions. The applied conditions include a broad range of hydrogen/deuterium pressures, from vacuum to high pressures reaching 1000 bar H2/D2, and temperatures, from cryocooling (2 K) to as high as 1273 K (1000 degrees C). Simultaneously, various state-of-charge and discharge are probed when studying metal-H/D systems for hydrogen/deuterium gas storage and as anode electrodes of metal hydride batteries. The range of the studied systems includes but is not limited to the AB5, AB2 Laves type, AB, equiatomic ternary ABC intermetallics and Mg-containing layered AB3 structures and composites. Prospects on Li-ion full cells are considered as well. Interrelations between the structure and hydrogen storage performance, including maximum and reversible H storage capacity, hysteresis of hydrogen absorption and desorption, H2 absorption and desorption in dynamic equilibrium conditions, are considered and related to the ultimate goal of optimisation of the H storage behaviours of the advanced H storage materials. Numerous contributions of Dr. Michel Latroche to the field are highlighted, particularly in in situ studies during electrochemical transformations. The paper summarises a long-standing collaboration of the co-authors in the field, which also included 29 joint topical publications with Dr. Michel Latroche, and references 163 original publications.

   equation; the Lamb shift; atom-motion-induced shifts

AB When the hydrogen atom moves, the proton current generates a magnetic field which interacts with the hydrogen electron. A simple analysis shows that for the hydrogen velocity nu/c <<alpha the dominant interaction between the hydrogen momentum and the electron is of order of alpha(3)nu/cm, where a is the fine structure constant, v is the atom velocity, c is the speed of light and m is the electron mass. Using the Bethe-Salpeter equation, the two velocity-dependent operators of this order are derived. As is well known, the degeneracy of the energy levels with the same principal quantum number, n, and the same quantum number of the total angular momentum, j, but the different orbital angular momenta l = j +/- 1/2 is removed by the radiative corrections (the Lamb shift) that are proportional to alpha(5)m. It is shown that the velocity-dependent perturbation interactions remove this degeneracy as well. There is, however, an important difference between the Lamb shifts and the energy-level shifts induced by the atom motion. The Lamb shift is the diagonal correction to the energy separately for each of the degenerate states. The velocity-dependent perturbation interactions result in the off-diagonal energy corrections between the mutually degenerate states. The joint effect of these two perturbations, which are essentially different in their origin, is analyzed. Given their order of magnitude, the crossover from the Lamb shifts to the motion-induced shifts should occur at the atom velocity nu = k alpha(2)c, where k >> 1 is a numerical factor dependent on n and j. An experiment using the orbital motion of the Earth is proposed to test the developed theory.

   ORIGIN
AB Multiply charged superfluid helium nanodroplets are utilized to facilitate the growth of cationic copper clusters (Cun+, where n = 1-8) that are subsequently solvated with up to 50 H2 molecules. Production of both pristine and protonated cationic Cu clusters are detected mass spectrometrically. A joint effort between experiment and theory allows us to understand the nature of the interactions determining the bonding between pristine and protonated Cu+ and Cu2+ cations and molecular hydrogen. The analysis reveals that in all investigated cationic clusters, the primary solvation shell predominantly exhibits a covalent bonding character, which gradually decreases in strength, while for the subsequent shells an exclusive non-covalent behaviour is found. Interestingly, the calculated evaporation energies associated with the first solvation shell markedly surpass thermal values, positioning them within the desirable range for hydrogen storage applications. This comprehensive study not only provides insights into the solvation of pristine and protonated cationic Cu clusters but also sheds light on their unique bonding properties.
   We underscore a solid agreement between experimental and computational studies on solvation of pristine/protonated Cun+ (n = 1-2) in H2. For instance, with n = 1, the initial shell comprises four covalently bound H2; subsequent ones are non-covalent.

AB Glycosaminoglycans are a wide class of biopolymers showing great lubricating properties due to their structure and high affinity to water. Two of them, hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate, play an important role in articular cartilage lubrication. In this work, we present results of the all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of both molecules placed in water-based solution. To mimic changes of the physiological conditions, especially temperature, of the synovial fluid in joints under successive load (e.g., walking, jogging, jumping), simulations have been performed at different physiological temperatures in the range of 300 to 320 Kelvin (normal intra-articular temperature is 305 K). The stability of the biopolymeric network at equilibrium (isothermal and isobaric) conditions has been studied. To understand the process of physical crosslinking, the dynamics of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds forming and breaking have been studied. The results show that following addition of chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronan creates more intermolecular hydrogen bonds than when in homogeneous solution. The presence of chondroitin in a hyaluronan network is beneficial as it may increase its stability. Presented data show hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate as viscosity modifiers related to their crosslinking properties in different physicochemical conditions.

AB The article is devoted to the problem of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) integration into power supply systems. A hybrid energy complex (HEC) based on PEMFCs and lithium iron phosphate batteries can be used as a reliable energy source. It is necessary to properly determine the PEMFC characteristics in order to develop a PEMFC-based HEC prototype and its control algorithms. This paper presents a 1 kW PEMFC's test results in steady and dynamic modes. The dependences of the average hydrogen consumption per 1 min, the volume of hydrogen for the generation of 1 kWh, the PEMFC efficiency on the load current were obtained and an analysis of these dependences for steady operation modes was performed. A range of load changes beyond which the efficiency of the PEMFC significantly decreased and it was recommended to switch to the joint operation of the PEMFCs and batteries (or only batteries) was established. Diagrams of the PEMFC output voltage during the dynamic changes in loads are presented and an analysis of transient response characteristics was carried out. The air supply fans were found to affect the performance of PEMFCs.

ID GAS SENSITIVITY; METAL-OXIDES; SNO2 SENSORS; GRAIN-SIZE; CO
AB This paper presents a joint experimental and theoretical investigation of sensor response of nanostructured In2O3 semiconductor thin films containing a large concentration of conduction electrons. The capture of the conduction electrons by oxygen adsorbates from air causes redistribution of the electrons inside the nanoparticles, resulting in reduction of the subsurface electron density, and the drop of the conductivity of nanoparticle thin films. When CO and H-2 reduced gas analytes are introduced to the system, their reaction with previously adsorbed negative atomic oxygen ions O- releases electrons back to the nanoparticles, producing a noticeable increase of thin-film conductivity, which constitutes the sensor effect. This work presents a kinetic model of such processes, which allows us to a quantitative description of the sensor effect including dependence of sensor sensitivity on temperature. Concurrently, experiments are performed to quantify the sensor response by nanostructured In2O3 thin film as a function of temperature and hydrogen concentration upon addition of hydrogen gas to the gas medium. The measured response is described well by the theoretical model developed in this work.

AB Histidine tautomerism plays a key role in the aggregation of amyloid peptides, which is important for understanding the origin of Alzheimer's disease as well as its diagnosis and treatment. Herein, density functional theory calculations were performed using explicit water molecules and joint implicit/explicit water cluster models to explore the catalytic mechanism and the key role of water assistance effect in the histidine tautomerization reaction. To clarify the proton transfer mechanism involved in histidine tautomerization, three to five water molecules were used to catalyze the proton transfer process governing the transition between the histidine tautomers. Potential energy calculations showed that hi epsilon.(H2O) n tautomerism proceeds via a single proton transfer pathway. Systematic analyses of the hydrogen bonds and charge distribution of the key components indicated that tautomerism can be promoted by reducing the number of assistant water molecules or involving the joint implicit/explicit water solvent effect. This study provides theoretical insights into the mechanism of water-assisted histidine isomerization as it relates to the A ss aggregation hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease.

AB This study aimed to evaluate Poly (caprolactone) microparticles (MPs) loaded composite injectable Chitosan gel (CICGs) as a dual purpose (visco-supplement and intra articular drug delivery depot) therapeutic agent for the treatment of Osteoarthritis. Etoricoxib (COX-2 inhibitor), a highly hydrophobic drug was chosen as a model drug for the study. When administered orally, Etoricoxib poses severe cardiovascular toxicity issues. So, we have attempted to deliver this drug intra-articularly, which could retain the drug longer in the joint region and thus could ameliorate these toxicity issues. CICGs were prepared by dispersing MPs in the chitosan-Ammonium hydrogen phosphate solution and incubated at 37 degrees C. Rheology studies proved that gels were stable and had visco-elastic properties comparable to that of existing visco-supplements. The in vitro drug release profiles of CICGs were found to be more controlled when compared to MPs and bare chitosan gel (BCGs). In vitro and in vivo biocompatibility studies proved that the gels were biocompatible. In vivo synovial drug clearance studies proved that CICGs had a better drug retention capacity than BCGs and MPs. In vivo fluorescence imaging results confirmed that CICGs could stay longer in the joint region when compared to BCGs and MPs. Thus this novel CICGs could be a potential dual purpose gel for the treatment of diseased joint regions especially for Osteoarthritis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Chitosan-collagen blends have been widely applied in tissue engineering, joints diseases treatment, and many other biomedical fields. Understanding the affinity between chitosan and collagen type II is particularly relevant in the context of mechanical properties modulation, which is closely associated with designing biomaterials suitable for cartilage and synovial fluid regeneration. However, many structural features influence chitosan's affinity for collagen. One of the most important ones is the deacetylation degree (DD) in chitosan and the hydroxylation degree (HD) of proline (PRO) moieties in collagen. In this paper, combinations of both factors were analyzed using a very efficient molecular dynamics approach. It was found that DD and HD modifications significantly affect the structural features of the complex related to considered types of interactions, namely hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic, and ionic contacts. In the case of hydrogen bonds both direct and indirect (water bridges) contacts were examined. In case of the most collagen analogues, a very good correlation between binding free energy and DD was observed.

SO ADVANCED SCIENCE

AB Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is closely associated with intestinal microbiota dysbiosis, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting the microbiota-gut-joint axis. Current interventions often overlook the cascade nature of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in driving intestinal and systemic inflammation. Herein, a valence-engineered CeOX-based nanozyme with self-cascade catalytic activity is developed, mimicking sequential oxidase-superoxide dismutase-peroxidase functions to enable continuous ROS scavenging while minimizing oxygen generation. By precisely tuning Ce3+/Ce4+ ratios from 0.27 to 0.93 through Au deposition (0.23 wt.%-> 5.2 wt.%), Dual functionality is achieved: 1) enhanced oxygen vacancy generation (71.4%) for efficient ROS scavenging via superoxide anion -> hydrogen peroxide -> hydroxide ion conversion, and 2) suppressed oxygen production to maintain the anaerobic microenvironment essential for gut microbiota. Encapsulating the nanozyme with sodium alginate (SA) to form Au/CeOX(0.93)@SA ensures resistance to gastric acid upon oral administration. In RA model rats, this strategy restored gut microbial balance, normalized short-chain fatty acid profiles, and significantly attenuated joint inflammation and cartilage degradation. The therapeutic efficacy is further evidenced by reduced systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and improved intestinal barrier integrity. This study established a design paradigm for gut microenvironment-adapted nanozymes, offering a dual-action strategy for early RA intervention through synchronized ROS elimination and microbiota homeostasis restoration.

AB We present a new method to infer parameters of the temperature-density relation in the intergalactic medium in the post-reionization epoch at z similar to 2-4. This method is based on the analysis of the distribution of Ly alpha absorbers over column densities and Doppler parameters by the model joint probability density function. This approach allows us to measure the power-law index gamma of the temperature-density relation and a certain combination of the temperature at the mean density T-0 and hydrogen photoionization rate Gamma. To estimate T-0 and Gamma separately, we employ measurements of the Ly alpha forest effective opacity and the model gas probability density function. We show that gamma tends to be lower than 1.6 and reaches 1.3 at redshift similar to 3. The inferred temperatures at the mean density are similar to(2 +/- 0.5) x 10(4) K in the studied redshift range. Both these estimates favor He II reionization at z greater than or similar to 3. We find that the hydrogen photoionization rate is similar to 0.6 x 10(-12) s(-1), which is consistent with previous measurements.

DT Article; Early Access
AB Flexible and self-healing ion-conductive materials show potential advantages in wearable health monitoring systems based on the internet of things (IoT). However, their practical applications are limited by the directional selectivity and detection range of the sensor. Here, a room-temperature self-healing, ion-conductive polyurethane elastomer that shows excellent mechanical properties, high conductivity, bidirectional sensing and thermoelectric properties was synthesized. Due to the presence of multiple hydrogen bonds, it can effectively dissipate energy through the destruction and recombination of multiple reversible hydrogen bonds, achieving a high mechanical strength (34 MPa) and excellent room-temperature self-healing ability (self-healing efficiency of 91.4%). Significantly, the synergistic monitoring of strain, temperature, and thermoelectricity can be realized based on the existence of the synergistic ion/electron-conductive components of the self-healing ion-conductive elastomer. The strain module enables bi-directional monitoring and high sensitivity (GF similar to 5.23). Additionally, the temperature module has a resistance temperature coefficient of 2.42, while the thermoelectric module provides a power density of 1.59 mW m-1 K-2. Furthermore, leveraging the photon-thermal-electric coupling effect, a non-contact photoelectric sensor is fabricated, which can realize high-temperature detection/protection. As a wearable electronic device, it shows advantages in joint rehabilitation monitoring systems and prevention/monitoring systems.

AB The quality of electron beam welding between GH4169 and electroformed Ni (E-Ni) has emerged as a pivotal factor in the manufacturing of hydrogen-oxygen engines. The welding process involving dissimilar materials, however, is susceptible to the occurrence of incomplete fusion defects, with the underlying causes of these defects remaining elusive. In order to enhance the welding quality of GH4169 and E-Ni and eliminate incomplete fusion defects, a novel finite element model integrating thermo-electro-magnetic multi-physical fields coupling was established in this study, revealing the formation mechanism of such defects. The results demonstrated that significant thermoelectric effects arose during the welding process due to the disparities in temperature gradients and Seebeck coefficients between GH4169 and E-Ni. The thermoelectric effect induces the emergence of a magnetic field, primarily concentrated within a 10 mm zone above the weld. Subsequently, this magnetic field causes a significant deflection of the electron beam towards the GH4169, specifically by 128 mu m. This deviation ultimately results in the occurrence of incomplete fusion defects, compromising the welding quality. Based on the underlying mechanism of the thermoelectric effect on the electron beam, an inclined welding joint was designed, successfully eliminating the incomplete fusion defects at the root of the GH4169 and E-Ni electron beam welding joint. The resulting joint exhibited a remarkable strength of 411 MPa. The present analysis of the incomplete fusion defect formation mechanism provides theoretical support for the improvement of the electron beam welding process for GH4169 and E-Ni, pioneering a novel defect-free welding technique for these materials.

AB As renewable energy technologies advance, identifying efficient photocatalytic materials for water splitting to produce hydrogen has become an important research focus in materials science. This study presents a multi-task regression model (MTRM) designed to predict the conduction band minimum (CBM), valence band maximum (VBM), and solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (STH) of inorganic materials. Utilizing crystallographic and band gap data from over 15,000 materials in the SNUMAT database, machine-learning methods are applied to predict CBM and VBM, which are subsequently used as additional features to estimate STH. A deep neural network framework with a multi-branch, multi-task regression structure is employed to address the issue of error propagation in traditional cascading models by enabling feature sharing and joint optimization of the tasks. The calculated results show that, while traditional tree-based models perform well in single-task predictions, MTRM achieves superior performance in the multi-task setting, particularly for STH prediction, with an MSE of 0.0001 and an R2 of 0.8265, significantly outperforming cascading approaches. This research provides a new approach to predicting photocatalytic material performance and demonstrates the potential of multi-task learning in materials science.

AB High-precision time synchronization is significant to fundamental physics and measurement science. And stable timescales are the basis for high-precision time synchronization. Timescales are mainly established based on atomic clocks. Despite the good short-term stability of atomic clocks, their long-term stability is compromised by frequency drift and noises. This seriously reduces the accuracy of time synchronization. In contrast, millisecond pulsars exhibit excellent long-term stability. Combining atomic clocks with pulsars in timekeeping helps to improve stability performance which is of great significance for improving time synchronization accuracy. Therefore, the millisecond pulsar augmented atomic clock ensemble timescale algorithm is proposed. Firstly, frequency drifts of hydrogen masers are eliminated with reference of the pulsar and the long-term stability of atomic clocks is improved. Then, the weighted average algorithm with special weight design is proposed to establish the joint ensemble timescale. Experiment results show that the joint ensemble timescale improved the Allan deviation of 2.83 x 10-13 and 8.82 x 10-13 on one-year and three-year averaging time compared with atomic time. For short-term stability, the joint ensemble timescale improved the Allan deviation of 1.47 x 10-13 and 2.01 x 10-13 on one-day and one-month averaging time compared with pulsar time. The proposed algorithm is expected to establish stable time to achieve high-precision time synchronization in measurement science.

The catalyst of the composition 0.4Co/HZSM-5/SO42- (2.0)-ZrO2 at 180 degrees C allows up to 63.5% of gaseous C4- alkanes to be involved in isomerization-disproportionation processing of the mixture of straight-run naphtha and propane-butane fraction (1 : 1 by weight), the content of C-5-C-6 alkanes in the catalyzate to be increased by 21.4%, and the relative content of their branched isomers to be increased to 88.8%. The effect of hydrogen on the conversion of C4- and C8+ components of the mixture of straight-run naphtha and propane-butane fraction (1 : 1 by weight) was studied; an increase in the H-2/hydrocarbon ratio from 2 to 4 leads to an increase in the conversion of C4- alkanes from 63.5 to 90%. The possibility of expanding the resources for producing C-5-C-6 alkanes with increased content of high-octane branched components by joint processing of the propane-butane fraction and straight-run naphtha was demonstrated.

AB Underground hydrogen energy storage (UHES) in lined rock caverns (LRCs) is of paramount importance in addressing the inherent instability of clean energy generation and in facilitating the accelerated restructuring of the global energy mix. However, this technology entails greater requirements for the safety and stability of concrete lining. The present study comprises a series of shear tests on steel fiber reinforced shotcrete-rock (SFCR) specimens, which are subjected to a range of normal stress (6n), shear rate (SR), joint roughness coefficients (JRC) and steel fiber content (SF). The destabilization mechanism of the SFC-R interface is investigated through the integration of acoustic emission (AE), digital image correlation (DIC) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Furthermore, the stress distribution characteristics of steel fibers are investigated through numerical simulation. Results show that a sudden drop in shear force occurs in the specimens after reaches the peak value, and due to the bridging effect of the steel fibers, some specimens show a rebound rise in shear force. During the shearing process, normal shear shrinkage is observed initially due to the closure of the cavity and compression of the material. Subsequently, normal shear expansion occurs due to the inhomogeneity of the joint surface. The mean level of AE hits and peak AE hits are proportional to 6n, SR and JRC. Besides, they showed a positive correlation with SF only during the intensified damage stage. As 6n, SR, and JRC increased, or SF decreased, the specimens demonstrated an inclination towards cracking, which ultimately resulted in the deterioration of the concrete and rock. Consequently, the stress level within the steel fibers embedded within the concrete is also increased. This is evidenced by the formation of aggregated regions exhibiting patchy deformation, as illustrated by the DIC images.

AB Plasma disruptions present a significant challenge to the viability of fusion energy production in tokamak reactors. Among disruption mitigation techniques, shattered pellet injection (SPI) has emerged as a promising approach. The results presented in this paper show novel findings of the impact of nitrogen and neon seeding on the disruption mitigation sequence following SPI on the Joint European Torus (JET). This study exposes an order of magnitude reduction in pre-thermal quench duration for highly seeded plasmas and pure deuterium SPI, a result with significant implications for staggered SPI schemes currently under development. Conversely, no reduction in disruption thermal load mitigation efficacy was observed for single neon and hydrogen mixed SPI across a range of seeding levels, indicating the robustness of this approach. A novel pathway for thermal load mitigation and enhanced runaway electron avoidance with pure deuterium SPI into strongly seeded plasmas is also presented.

AB Dissimilar metal welded (DMW) joint plays a crucial role in constructing and maintaining ultra-supercritical (USC) nuclear power plants while presenting noteworthy environmental implications. This research examines different welding techniques utilized in DMWJ, specifically emphasizing materials such as P91. The study investigates the mechanical properties of these materials, the impact of alloying elements, the notable difficulties encountered with industrial materials, and the concept of buttering. The USC nuclear power plants necessitate welding procedures appropriate for the fusion of diverse metal alloys. Frequently employed methodologies encompass shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), gas metal arc welding (GMAW), and flux-cored arc welding (FCAW). Every individual process possesses distinct advantages and limitations, and the choice of process is contingent upon various factors, including joint configuration, material properties, and the desired weld quality. The steel alloy known as P91, which possesses high strength and resistance to creep, is extensively employed in advanced ultra-supercritical (AUSC) power plants. P91 demonstrates exceptional mechanical characteristics, encompassing elevated-temperature strength, commendable thermal conductivity, and notable resistance against corrosion and oxidation. The presence of alloying elements, namely chromium, molybdenum, and vanadium, in P91, is responsible for its improved characteristics and appropriateness for utilization in (AUSC) power plant applications. Nevertheless, the utilization of industrial materials in DMW joint is accompanied by many noteworthy concerns, such as the propensity for stress corrosion cracking (SCC), hydrogen embrittlement, and creep deformation under high temperatures. The challenges mentioned above require meticulous material selection, process optimization, and rigorous quality control measures to guarantee the dependability and sustained effectiveness of DMW joint. To tackle these concerns, a commonly utilized approach referred to as buttering is frequently employed. When forming DMW joint in nuclear facilities, it is customary to place a buttering coating on ferritic steel. This facilitates the connection between pressure vessel components of ferritic steel and pipes of austenitic stainless steel. The primary difficulty in DMW joint manufacturing is in mitigating the significant disparity in material characteristics resulting from carbon migration and metallurgical alterations along the fusion interface between ferritic steel and austenitic stainless steel. The process of buttering entails the application of a compatible filler material onto the base metal before the deposition of the desired weld metal. The intermediate layer serves as a mediator, enhancing the metallurgical compatibility, diminishing the probability of fracture, and enhancing the overall integrity of the joint. Buttering is still a new research area with a wide scenario of scope in terms of development, which could revolutionize developing high-temperature. These long-term sustainable joints could serve under critical conditions like AUSC power plants and reduce CO2 emissions by increasing the overall efficiencies of the systems.

AB High-strength structural steels are used in machine, steel, and crane construction with yield strength up to 960 MPa. However, welding of these steels requires profound knowledge of three factors in terms of avoidance of hydrogen-assisted cracking (HAC): the interaction of microstructure, local stress/strain, and local hydrogen concentration. In addition to the three main factors, the used arc process is also important for the performance of the welded joint. In the past, the conventional transitional arc process (Conv. A) was mainly used for welding of high-strength steel grades. In the past decade, the so-called modified spray arc process (Mod. SA) has been increasingly used for welding production. This modified process enables reduced seam opening angles with increased deposition rates compared with the Conv. A. Economic benefits of using this arc type are a reduction of necessary weld beads and required filler material. In the present study, the susceptibility to HAC in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of the high-strength structural steel S960QL was investigated with the externally loaded implant test. For that purpose, both Conv. A and Mod. SA were used with same heat input at different deposition rates. Both conducted test series showed same embrittlement index "EI" of 0.21 at diffusible hydrogen concentrations of 1.3 to 1.6 ml/100 g of arc weld metal. The fracture occurred in the HAZ or in the weld metal (WM). However, the test series with Mod. SA showed a significant extension of the time to failure of several hours compared with tests carried out with Conv. A.

AB The heating power to access the high confinement mode (H-mode), P (LH), scales approximately inversely with the isotope mass of the main ion plasma species as found in (protonic) hydrogen, deuterium and tritium plasmas in many fusion facilities over the last decades. In first dedicated L-H transition experiments at the Joint European Torus (JET) tokamak facility with the ITER-like wall (ILW), the power threshold, P (LH), was studied systematically in plasmas of pure tritium and hydrogen-tritium mixtures at a magnetic field of 1.8 T and a plasma current of 1.7 MA in order to assess whether this scaling still holds in a metallic wall device. The measured power thresholds, P (LH), in Ohmically heated tritium plasmas agree well with the expected isotope scaling for metallic walls and the lowest power threshold was found in Ohmic phases at low density. The measured power thresholds in ion cyclotron heated plasmas of pure tritium or hydrogen-tritium mixtures are significantly higher than the expected isotope mass scaling due to higher radiation levels. However, when the radiated power is taken into account, the ion cyclotron heated plasmas exhibit similar power thresholds as a neutral beam heated plasma, and are close to the scaling. The tritium plasmas in this study tended to higher electron heating fractions and, when heated with ion cyclotron waves, to relatively higher radiation fractions compared to other isotopes potentially impeding access to sustained H-modes.

AB This work studied the Mn dopant layer gallium nitride (GaN) and addressed the suitability of Mn-doping as a means to potentially produce a semiconductor material system in GN derivatives. A comprehensive investigation on hydrogen grabbing by heteroclusters of Mn-doped GaN, AlGaN, InGaN was carried out using DFT computations at the CAM-B3LYP-D3/6-311+G(d, p) level of theory. The notable fragile signal intensity close to the parallel edge of the nanocluster sample might be owing to manganese binding induced non-spherical distribution of Mn@GaN, Mn@AlGaN or Mn@InGaN heteroclusters. The hypothesis of the energy adsorption phenomenon was confirmed by density distributions of CDD, TDOS/PDOS/OPDOS, and ELF for GaN and its alloys. A vaster jointed area engaged by an isosurface map for Mn doping GaN, AlGaN, InGaN towards formation of nanocomposites of Mn@GaN-H, Mn@AlGaN-H, Mn@InGaN-H after hydrogen adsorption due to labeling atoms of N4, Mn5, H18, respectively. Therefore, it can be considered that manganese in the functionalized Mn@GaN, Mn@AlGaN or Mn@InGaN might have more impressive sensitivity for accepting the electrons in the process of hydrogen adsorption. The changes of Gibbs free energy versus for all nanocomposites could detect the maximum efficiency of Mn@AlGaN-H > Mn@GaN-H > Mn@InGaN-H for energy storage through . The advantages of manganese over GaN, AlGaN, or InGaN include its higher electron and hole mobility, allowing manganese doping devices to operate at higher frequencies than non-doping devices.

TI Vanadium Cluster Neutrals Reacting with Water: Superatomic Features and

AB Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is known as the heart of various energy storage and conversation systems of renewable energy sources. Here we observe the cluster reactions of a light transition metal, vanadium, with water in a gas-phase flow tube reactor. While HER products of V-1 and V-2 were not observed, the effective HER of water on neutral V-n (n >= 3) clusters reveals reasonable and size-dependent reactivity of the vanadium clusters. Superatomic features and reaction dynamics of V-10, V-13, and V-16 are highlighted. Among the three typical superatoms, V-10 and V-16 exhibit an abnormal superatomic orbital energy level order, 1S vertical bar 2S vertical bar 1P vertical bar 1D..., where the energy-reduced 2S orbital helps to accommodate the geometric structure and hence reinforce the cluster stability. In comparison, V-13 bears a less symmetrical structure and reacts readily with water, allowing for recombination of a hydroxyl atom with an adsorbed hydrogen atom, akin to a fishing-mode HER process. The joint experimental and theoretical study on neutral Vn clusters clarifies the availability of superatom chemistry for transition metals and appeals further development of cluster theory based on electronic cloud/orbital analysis instead of simply counting the valence electrons. Also, we provide insights into the HER mechanism of metal clusters and propose a strategy to design new materials for portable fuel cells of hydrogen energy.

AB The automotive business is growing continuously along with the global economy. One way to lessen environmental pollution in recent times is to look for clean energy to replace traditional fossil fuels as the vehicle's power source. This is because there is a lack of environmental energy among other issues. This manuscript proposes an Energy Management Strategy of Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicles. The proposed hybrid technique is the joint execution of both the Giant Trevally Optimizer (GTO) and Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRNN). Hence, it is named as GTO-HGRNN technique. This proposed method's principal objective is to reduce hydrogen use and raise battery longevity. The proposed GTO approach is used to optimize the DC/DC converter parameter and fuel consumption and the HGRNN approach is used to predict the optimal parameter of the DC/DC converter parameter. By then, the MATLAB platform has the proposed method been implemented, and the existing method is used to compute the execution. Better outcomes are shown by the proposed strategy in all existing systems like Genetic Algorithm, Global Optimisation Algorithms, and Particle Swarm Optimization. The existing method shows hydrogen consumption of 0.4%, 0.3%, and 0.2% the proposed method shows a hydrogen consumption of 0.1% which is lower than another existing system. The existing method shows the cost of 14.90$, 15.90$, and 16.90$ the proposed method shows the cost of 13.90$, which is lower than another existing system.

AB Exploring efficient and robust photocatalysts for solar hydrogen generation from water reduction is great significant in solving the energy shortage and environment contamination simultaneously. Herein, benefiting from the matchable energy band structures and band bending, the direct Z-scheme ZnIn2S4/NiWO4 heterojunctions were successfully constructed by anchoring p-type NiWO4 nanoparticles onto n-type ZnIn2S4 nanosheets through a facile sonochemical route. By carefully regulating the interfacial structure, the optimized ZnIn2S4/NiWO4 heterostructure without any cocatalyst displays excellent stability and remarkably improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity (16.3 mmol & BULL;g � 1 & BULL;h-1), more 3.57-folds increment than bare ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst. Mechanistic characterizations demonstrate that the dramatically boosted photocatalytic performance mainly results from the constructed Z-scheme heterostructure and intimately interfacial contact between ZnIn2S4 and NiWO4, which results in the valid interfacial charge transfer channels, powerful redox potential and reduced hydrogen evolution energy barrier, as confirmed by the joint analysis of electron spin resonance (ESR) and photoelectrochemical measurements. More importantly, the photoinduced holes of ZnIn2S4 are rapidly and effectively consumed in the unique Z-scheme charge transfer channels, which greatly favors the suppression of the photocorrosion caused by insufficient hole extraction during the photocatalytic reaction, thereby promoting the overall stability and reusability of the ZnIn2S4/NiWO4 composite photocatalyst. This study paves the way for constructing other Z-scheme nano-heterostructure consisting of p-type and n-type semiconductors with efficient photoactivity and robust stability for energy and environmental applications.

AB Objective The objective of this article is the creation and investigation of bifunctional suppositories that are endowed with antifungal and probiotic properties intended for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and colonization of the vaginal cavity by powerful lactobacilli. Materials and methods Freeze-dried Lactobacillus delbrueckii MH10 was used as a probiotic, which is an active producer of H2O2 isolated from a healthy woman's vagina. Hydrophilic PEG 4000/400, amphiphilic Suppocire AP, and lipophilic Novata ABPH bases were used for the preparation of vaginal suppositories and each included 80 mg terconazole and 25 mg (similar to 10(9) CFU) lactobacilli. The release kinetic of active agents from suppositories was studied using the British Pharmacopeia's basket dissolution method, and the physicochemical properties were studied using known methods. Bioadhesion of suppositories was evaluated by flow rate from polyacrylamide substrate inclined at 60 degrees. Antagonism of lactobacillus against fungi was studied using the disk diffusion method and joint cultivation in simulated vaginal fluid. Results The release rate of active ingredients from the suppositories was PEG 4000/400 > Suppocire AP > Novata ABPH in decreasing order. Suppositories made of Suppocire AP possessed higher adhesion ability to artificial mucosa and longer shelf life. It was revealed that during joint cultivation L. delbrueckii MH10 kills more than 90% of C. albicans population. Conclusions Due to its physicochemical, biopharmaceutical, and bioadhesive properties, the base Suppocire AP is preferable for manufacturing vaginal bifunctional suppositories. Lactobacilli kill C. albicans by coaggregating and direct releasing hydrogen peroxide onto target cells.

AB The observations of solar flare onsets show rapid increase of hard and soft X-rays, ultra-violet emission with large Doppler blue shifts associated with plasma upflows, and Ha hydrogen emission with red shifts up to 1-4 angstrom. Modern radiative hydrodynamic models account well for blue-shifted emission, but struggle to reproduce closely the red-shifted Ha lines. Here we present a joint hydrodynamic and radiative model showing that during the first seconds of beam injection the effects caused by beam electrons can reproduce Ha line profiles with large red-shifts closely matching those observed in a C1.5 flare by the Swedish Solar Telescope. The model also accounts closely for timing and magnitude of upward motion to the corona observed 29 s after the event onset in 171 angstrom by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly/Solar Dynamics Observatory.

AB The paper presents the results of an investigation of the nanostructure, elements, and phase composition of thin (100-140 nm) tin dioxide films obtained via magnetron sputtering and containing Ag, Y, Sc, Ag + Y, and Ag + Sc additives in the volume. Electrical and gas-sensitive characteristics of hydrogen sensors based on these films with dispersed Pt/Pd layers deposited on the surface were studied. The additives had a significant effect on the nanostructure of the films, the density of oxygen adsorption sites on the surface of tin dioxide, the band bending at the grain boundaries of tin dioxide, the resistance values in pure air, and the responses to hydrogen in the concentration range of 50-2000 ppm. During the long-term tests of most of the samples studied, there was an increase in the resistance of the sensors in clean air and in the response to hydrogen. It has been established that the joint introduction of Ag + Y into the volume of films prevents the increase in the resistance and response. For these sensors based on thin films of Pt/Pd/SnO2:Sb, Ag, Y the responses to 100 and 1000 ppm of H-2 are 25 and 575, correspondingly, the response time at exposure to 100 and 1000 ppm of H-2 are 10 and 90 s, the recovery time at exposure to 100 and 1000 ppm of H-2 17 and 125 s. Possible mechanisms of the effect of additives on the properties of sensors and the stability of their parameters during long-term operation were considered.

   Integrated demand response
AB To achieve the goal of carbon neutrality, integrated energy hubs (EHs) based on coupled energy sources such as electricity, gas and heat are gaining increasing attention due to their efficient and flexible energy supply characteristics. The introduction of integrated EHs may lead to the reconstruction of the existing superior energy network to accommodate the suitable flow of the new network. In this study, a multi-objective optimization model is proposed that synergistically considers the optimal configuration of EHs and the reconstruction of higher-level energy networks, with the objectives of minimizing total annual energy supply costs and CO 2 emissions. First, an EH and multi-energy network (MEN) topology model considering hydrogen energy is developed. Secondly, the joint output of wind and solar power under typical scenarios is sampled and obtained by employing the Monte Carlo sampling method and the synchronous back-propagation scenario analysis method. To address the nonlinear constraint problem associated with multi-energy storage output, the Big -M method is introduced to improve the optimization capability of spatial -temporal coupling of energy storage. Moreover, the utilization potential of hydrogen and renewable energy is explored by considering constraints on the nonlinear dynamic pricing of hydrogen. Finally, a numerical analysis is conducted using an illustrative example. The Pareto frontier optimal results, derived from fuzzy theory membership functions, are achieved using both classical and heuristic algorithms. The classical mixed-integer linear programming algorithm yields relatively superior optimization outcomes in terms of annual energy costs and carbon emissions compared to the heuristic algorithm. However, it suffers from longer computation times.

AB The fundamental understanding and precise tuning of interatomic s,p-d orbital hybridization are critical to the design of interstitial alloy catalysts containing light constituent atoms. Here, we present a joint theoretical and experimental study that reveals the importance of distribution, concentration and ordering of interstitial boron atoms in Pd-B alloy's near-surface electronic structure and catalytic performance. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the sub-surface location of interstitial boron atoms with a Pd:B atomic ratio of 2:1 is necessary to ensure an appropriate degree of interatomic s,p-d orbital hybridization, and thereby an optimal surface electronic structure for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We experimentally achieve this with highlycrystalline intermetallic Pd2B. Due to its optimal electronic structure and ordered arrangement of interstitial boron atoms, the intermetallic Pd2B exhibits Pt-like catalytic activity for HER and has excellent catalytic stability for over seven days.

AB As a result of the development of energy commercialization, integrated energy services can meet multiple forms of energy supply. In this paper, the cooperative game of a multi-park integrated energy system for industrial, commercial, and residential areas with hydrogen energy based on Nash bargaining theory is established towards the joint dispatching of parks with operation differences in energy sharing mode. Firstly, the techno-economic framework considering the difference of park integrated energy systems is built, whilst introducing the hydrogen-doped electric-to-gas process. Second, by taking into consideration the interests demands and individual differences of each park subject through the cooperative game, the operation representing the interests of the multi-park integrated energy system is established. Then, on the basis of ensuring that the proposed cooperative game model can maximize the social benefits, the original problem is transformed into two easier-to-solve sub-problems. The alternating direction method of multipliers is used to successively solve the two sub-problems in a distributed manner. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed model can reduce the purchased cost by 1298.8199 $, operation cost by 2319.3456 $, and carbon emissions by 62.1281 t, and improve the renewable energy integration by 12.3011 MW compared with the non-cooperative operation.

AB The Participation of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) such as Fuel Cell (FC) in Daily Market is one of the main Problems of these resources. Uncertain nature of market price and power system parameters can be affected to economic performance of DERs and is caused deviation penalties during market settlements. This article introduces an optimal combined sharing strategy of fuel cell/wind turbine/battery storage unit and demand response as microgrid to improve all of them profit in market participation. In order to adjust of contracted power and reduce the imbalanced energy, the Adjusted Market (AM) is considered 3-7 h before the delivered time, which the offered power could be updated in this time. Uncertainty of markets and DERs generations is considered using an optimal stochastic optimization approach. The probabilistic scenarios are generated using forecast error database in daily, adjusted and imbalance market as production of DERs. Uncertain variables are predicted by a neuro-fuzzy model. Finally, to demonstrate of the proposed joint model strategy, a test system contain fuel cell/wind turbine/battery storage unit and demand response is considered and the results is calculated during one week, month, and year period in joint and separated conditions.

AB The regions of CANDU (R) pressure tubes near the rolled joint (RJ) are the un-supported portions of the inlet and outlet ends just inboard of where the tubes make contact with the 403 stainless steel end fitting sections. Compared to the main body of the pressure tube, in-service conditions are more complex with large gradients in the flux, significant hydrogen isotope concentration profiles and varying operating temperatures. In order to increase the amount of data related to microstructure evolution, the microstructures near rolled-joint regions from an ex-service CANDU pressure tube were investigated. The results show that irradiation-induced effects on the microstructure are more significant than the temperature influence near the inlet rolled-joint region (that operates at lower temperatures). Thermal effects play a more dominant role than the flux near the outlet region (that operates at higher temperatures). Zirconium hydrides aligned in both circumferential and radial directions of the tube have been observed. The zirconium hydrides have an orientation relationship of (0002)(alpha Zr)//((111) over bar)(ZrH), and [2 (11) over bar0](alpha Zr)//[011](ZrH) with the alpha-Zr matrix; the hydride phases were identified as gamma (gamma) hydride by observing superlattice reflections on the (110) planes in the electron diffraction patterns. The presence of g hydrides at room temperature in the studied tube may have technical importance because in most of the previous research, delta hydrides were considered as the stable phase that would precipitate during cooling at reactor relevant rates. This assumption has been applied to both delayed hydride cracking (DHC) and fracture toughness experiments and during development of related models. It is critical to elucidate the phases of zirconium hydrides at relevant in-service conditions to enable representative experimental testing and modelling that can be used to verify and/or improve the predictive capability of material evolution and cracking behavior of zirconium alloys in nuclear reactors.

AB Offshore wind-to-hydrogen projects enjoy increasingly significant attention due to environmental protection advantages. Nevertheless, the development is hampered by multiple factors and therefore lagging expectations. Some studies have been devoted to this but there still are two deficiencies, namely incomplete barrier identification and biased analysis methods. Hence, this study is devoted to build a comprehensive research framework to effectively address barriers and promote high-quality development of offshore wind-to-hydrogen projects. Firstly, possible barriers are screened covering all stages of project management life cycle, and fourteen barriers are identified. Then a modified fuzzy decision making trial and evaluation laboratory method is applied to analyze these barriers, where K-Mediods clustering algorithm is introduced to improve threshold determination. Interactions among barriers are divided into four degrees with key parameters analyzed under four scenarios, and furtherly five critical barriers are extracted. By comparative analysis, the improved method promotes objectiveness of the result and thus is reliable to be applied to relevant analysis work. In conclusion, it is suggested to place emphasis on complicated planning & design, lack of technical specifications, high initial investment, immature business model and lack of high-matching modeling technology, joint efforts by government department, multiple enterprises and scientific institutions with five corresponding management suggestions.

AB Due to low ignition energy and wide range of flammability limit, explosion hazard of hydrogen/ammonia fuel must be evaluated to ensure safety application. In this work, effects of equivalence ratio, ammonia addition and initial pressure on the flame morphology and explosion pressure are revealed. The results demonstrate that effects of three factors on explosion hazard are ranked from the most important to the least important as initial pressure, equivalence ratio and ammonia hydrogen. The cellular flame formation by varying the equivalence ratio could be mainly attributed to the diffusional-thermal instability. The expanding flame of Phi = 0.8, 1.0 and 1.5 tends to be stable with ammonia addition. As initial pressure increases, there exists a joint and competitive effect of the diffusionai-thermal instability and hydrodynamic instability. Maximum explosion pressure of Phi = 0.8, 1.0 and 1.5 decreases monotonously with ammonia addition and increases linearly with initial pressure. The explosion pressure prediction is underestimated using the smooth flame model and reproduced satisfactorily using the wrinkled flame model. By varying equivalence ratio, ammonia addition and initial pressure, the most elementary reaction that enhances laminar flame velocity is R9 and the first two inhibiting reactions to laminar burning velocity are R10 and R168.

AB In harsh offshore environments, large-area sintered nano-copper (Cu) interconnections, which serve as die attachment material or thermal interface material (TIM), are prone to degradation from hydrogen sulfide (H2S) corrosion. This study introduced a film-forming technique based on atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) to improve the corrosion resistance of large-area sintered nanoCu joint. The corrosion protection mechanism against H2S-containing atmospheric corrosion was investigated using both experimental methods and density functional theory (DFT) simulations. The key findings were as follows: (1) The deposition film, primarily composed of a Si-O3 network, effectively protected sintered Cu plate from corrosion by H2S gas, and maintaining the mechanical performance of sintered Cu joint after 384 h of H2S testing. (2) The dissociation products of the APPJ-treated precursor hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO),-OSiCH3 and-OSi(CH3)3, formed stable chemical bonds on the sintered nanoCu surface, resulting in the formation of-OSiCH3(O-CH3)2 fragments. (3) The-OSiCH3(O-CH3)2 fragments were unreactive toward to corrosion agents such as H2S, O2, and H2O, and also serving as a barrier to block their access to the sintered nanoCu surface. This study provided a comprehensive understanding of the corrosion protection mechanism of sintered nanoCu using APPJ-deposited films, offering valuable insights for improving the reliability of power electronics.

AB Bottom on the ripple of the multiplication of sharing economy, hydrogen energy storage (HES) shared calls for novel solutions to ameliorate the cleanness and economy of micro-grids under the dual carbon target in China. The traditional investment method may become impracticable due to conflicting interests, insufficient utilization, and poor interoperability. The practical and prospective design of HES relies on innovation at the joint investment mechanism under incomplete synchronized and the interested equilibrium under limited rationality. This paper studies the capacity planning method for HES by multiple micro-grids from the sharing perspective. The evolution game model is utilized for conflict of interest, which exactly accounts for limited rationality. The dynamic competitive as well as time-varying demand for HES among multiple micro-grids are established by a small-word complex network theory. The dual dynamic evolutionary game of investment decision in multimicro-grid and capacity planning for sharing HES is realized by a proposed method of differential evolutionary game algorithm based on experience-weighted attraction learning. The numerical simulation is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and interpret the development path for sharing HES. The result shows that, the sizing method with limited rationality reduces the cost by 4.75% compared with the traditional game under complete rationality and 9.15% compared with the multi-objective optimization. The willingness of the park to participate in joint investment in shared HES is influenced by the long-term regulatory demand for energy storage and the decisions of other parks in the neighbors.

AB In this paper, a deep reinforcement learning-based energy optimization management method for hydrogenelectric coupling system is proposed for the conversion and utilization and joint optimization operation of hydrogen, wind and solar energy forms considering information uncertainty on the demand side of smart grid. Based on the wind energy, photovoltaic energy generation and load forecast information, the method uses deep Q network to simulate the energy management strategy set of the hydrogen-electric coupling system, and obtains the optimal strategy through reinforcement learning to finally realize the optimal operation of the hydrogenelectric coupling system based on the demand response. Firstly, based on the energy management model, a research framework and equipment model for integrated energy systems is established. On the basis of fundamental theories of reinforcement learning framework, Q-learning algorithm and DQN algorithm, the empirical replay mechanism and freezing parameter mechanism to improve the performance of DQN are analyzed, and the energy management and optimization of integrated energy system is completed with the objective of economy. By comparing the performance of DQN algorithms with different parameters in integrated energy system energy management, the simulation results demonstrate the improvement of algorithm performance after inheriting the set of strategies, and verify the feasibility and superiority of deep reinforcement learning compared to genetic algorithm in integrated energy system energy management applications.

AB A precise X-ray crystal structure determination of systems that exist in a polycrystalline form often poses a challenge due to several factors that limit the resolution of the diffraction measurement. The location of atoms is usually determined at significantly lower precision than the unit cell parameters, rendering the complete characterization of the structure difficult. This is particularly pronounced when precise location of hydrogen atoms is required, for instance in ionizable biomolecules or in hydrogen bonds. In such cases periodic quantum (DFT) calculations may crucially assist structure determination, because they can reliably predict the location of atoms, provided that the unit cell parameters, the space group and tentative atomic positions are known. In this work we present DFT-assisted structure determination of pentadecafluorooctanoic acid hydrate, a benchmark system featuring short hydrogen bonds (Ro...o approximate to 2.5 angstrom) between acid and water molecules. While Rietveld refinement based solely on powder diffraction data cannot reliably resolve the location of crystal water molecules and even less so the position of hydrogen atoms in the network of hydrogen bonds, periodic DFT optimization yields several minimum energy structures suitable for further refinement. Due to the low experimental resolution and similarity, comparison between model and experimental powder diffraction pattern can barely distinguish between certain structure candidates provided by DFT calculations, but it can rule out those featuring larger misfits. The proposed structure solution is delivered from a tandem application of structure determination from powder diffraction data and DFT optimization, the former providing the unit cell parameters and estimated atomic positions that are finely tuned by DFT. The present strategy can in principle be generalized to other examples of structure determination at relatively low resolution, such as is often the case with biological macromolecules.

AB In industries such as oil and gas, power generation, and manufacturing, the joining of dissimilar material is a common practice to optimize structural integrity, corrosion resistance, and other key properties. Dissimilar joint made of pipeline material and duplex stainless steel is prone to failure due to structural integrity issues such as corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement. In present work an attempt has been made to study the effect of 309L austenitic filler on the mechanical and microstructural properties of X70 and 2205 duplex stainless steel dissimilar weld fabricated by metal inert gas welding process (MIG). Impact toughness, hardness, corrosion and microstructure of X70 + 2205 dissimilar weld was studied.

AB An increasing number of applications of microelectronics products involve multiple reflows and/or extended operation at temperatures high enough that intermetallic growth in the solder joints becomes a concern even on Ni surfaces. Recent work has shown the evolution of large voids between the Ni3Sn4 intermetallic compound and the solder. It was also suggested that the buildup of stresses due to the Kirkendall effect makes this void formation "inevitable" once the Ni3Sn4 thickness has grown to more to more than 5 mu m. In a systematic study we find that no voids of any kind are observed in solder joints on high-purity Ni pads, while voiding of different levels of severity is seen upon soldering on electroplated Ni depending on specific processing conditions. We show that while the void growth may result in Ni stress relaxation, the void nucleation is associated with gasification of impurities and/or hydrogen in the Ni during reflow. This is evidenced by the fact that all voiding could be prevented by annealing of electroplated Ni pads to 450 degrees C for 24 h prior to soldering. We argue that, upon nucleation, voids do indeed grow further by coalescence of Kirkendall vacancies created by the disparity of Ni and Sn diffusion fluxes in aging, but the nucleation mechanism renders the voiding propensity controllable and eventually preventable. We discuss the minimization of voiding by control of Ni electroplating and reflow process parameters.

AB The development of NiO-based molecular photocathodes is attracting more interest in the field of dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells for efficient conversion of sunlight into fuel. For this purpose, different strategies are developed to assemble the molecular components together to build functional devices. Here, an original dye/catalyst supramolecular assembly was designed and obtained via axial coordination of a cobalt-based H-2-evolving catalyst, i.e., a cobaloxime complex, to a pyridyl-functionalized ruthenium-diacetylide photosensitizer. The new supramolecular assembly was successfully employed for the construction of efficient NiO-based photocathodes for solar hydrogen production. We report a joint experimental and theoretical study of the new photocatalytic system, including electrochemical and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. Photoelectrochemical generation of H-2 under pertinent aqueous conditions eventually led to a faradaic efficiency of 27%.

AB The interactions of the lignin model, the lignin oligomer with degree of polymerization n = 2, with 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ionic liquid were investigated through DFT calculations in detail. Computational results revealed that lignin dissolution in ionic liquids should be a result of the joint interactions of lignin with anion and cation of ionic liquid, and the formation of ion pair weakens the interactions between lignin and ionic liquid components. Unlike the dominant H-bonds within the lignin-anion interactions, the lignin-cation interactions involve a combination of hydrogen bond and pi-stacking. These results would provide mechanistic insights and suggestions for lignocellulosic dissolution in ionic liquids.

AB Oxygen-free copper (Cu) was successfully joined to carbon-fiber-reinforced thermoplastic (CFRTP, polyamide 6 with 20 wt% carbon fiber addition) by friction lap joining (FLJ) at joining speeds of 200-1600 mm/min with a constant rotation rate of 1500 rpm and a nominal plunge depth of 0.9 mm. It is the first time to report the joining of CFRTP to Cu by FLJ. As the joining speed increased, the tensile shear force (TSF) of joints increased first, and decreased thereafter. The maximum TSF could reach 2.3 kN (15 mm in width). Hydrogen bonding formed between the amide group of CFRTP and the thin Cu2O layer on the Cu surface, which mainly contributed to the joint bonding. The influence factors of the TSF of the joints at different joining speeds were discussed. The TSF was mainly affected by the joining area, the degradation of the plastic matrix and the number and the size of bubbles. As the joining speed increased, the influence factors varied as follows: the joining area increased first and then decreased; the degradation of the plastic matrix and the number and the size of bubbles decreased. The maximum TSF was the comprehensive result of the relatively large joining area, small degradation of the plastic matrix and small number and sizes of bubbles.

AB Plants encounter several abiotic stresses, among which heat stress is gaining paramount attention because of the changing climatic conditions. Severe heat stress conspicuously reduces crop productivity through changes in metabolic processes and in growth and development. Ethylene and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are signaling molecules involved in defense against heat stress through modulation of biomolecule synthesis, the antioxidant system, and post-translational modifications. Other compounds containing the essential mineral nutrient sulfur (S) also play pivotal roles in these defense mechanisms. As biosynthesis of ethylene and H2S is connected to the S-assimilation pathway, it is logical to consider the existence of a functional interplay between ethylene, H2S, and S in relation to heat stress tolerance. The present review focuses on the crosstalk between ethylene, H2S, and S to highlight their joint involvement in heat stress tolerance.

   mechanism
AB The healthy growth of plants is inseparable from the joint action of many metabolic regulators, particularly the signaling molecules. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which was considered toxic previously, has now been regarded as a burgeoning endogenous gaseous transmitter. H2S is involved in the whole life cycle of plants orderly, regulating essential plant processes such as seed germination, root growth, flowering, anti-aging of post-ripening by affecting corresponding gene expression and subsequent enzyme activities, as well as crosstalk with plant hormones and other signaling molecules. The research on H2S physiology entering an exponential exploration era, with significant progress has been made on many fronts of H2S function. However, the research on its molecular mechanism is still fragmented. In this review, we collect recent up-dates from physiological function to molecular biological mechanism of biological processes for H2S participating throughout plants' life cycle, and present a brief outlook for future research.

AB Polypropylene (PP) is wildly used to light the weight of advanced cars and vehicles due to its good resistance to abrasion and wear, high flexibility, and excellent impact strength. However, PP macromolecules consist of long chains of carbon atoms attached to hydrogen atoms. The non-functional surfaces of PP make it hard to achieve stable hybrid structures with metals. Current work reported an interfacial design strategy to manufacture highreliability PP/A6061-T6 aluminum alloy (6061) hybrid structures by friction assisted welding (FAW). To achieve this, carboxy group (COOH) was grafted on PP while the surficial microstructure was built on 6061. The introducing carboxy group reacted with 6061 to develop interfacial covalent and hydrogen bonds. The built surface microstructures of 6061 not only realized the mechanical interlock at PP/6061 interfaces but also improved the compatibility between PP and 6061. The surface microstructures enabled the good wetting and fast spread of melt PP to provide sufficient reaction area and time for the development of interfacial chemical interaction. Compared with other developed methods, our interfacial design strategy enhances the reliability of metal-thermoplastic hybrid structures with low equipment, process, materials, and environmental costs, making it a promising candidate for industrial applications. Current work provides a simple yet attractive strategy for achieving high-reliability joints between dissimilar metals and thermoplastics.

AB Aqueous solution of a fluoride ion at 300 K is studied using the method of ab initio molecular dynamics simulation. Instantaneous fluctuations in vibrational frequencies of local OD stretch modes of deuterated water are calculated using a time-series analysis of the simulated trajectory. The vibrational spectral diffusion of OD modes in the first and second solvation shells and also in bulk of the aqueous fluoride ionic solution are studied through calculations of the frequency time correlation function (FTCF), joint probability distributions, slope of three pulse photon echo (S3PE) and two dimensional infrared spectrum (2D-IR). The vibrational spectral dynamics in the first solvation shell shows decay with three components which can be correlated with the dynamics of intact ion-water hydrogen bonds, ion-water hydrogen bond lifetime and the escape dynamics of water molecules from the solvation shell. The vibrational spectral diffusion of OD modes in the second solvation shell and in the bulk show very similar decay behavior. The timescales obtained from FTCF, S3PE and the slope of nodal line (SNL) of 2D-IR are found to be in reasonable agreement with each others.

AB Mo-Mn metallization of alumina ceramics of different purity has been performed at 1400 degrees C for 10 min in moist hydrogen and nitrogen atmosphere. Nickel coating has been applied onto the metallized alumina ceramics at 1000 degrees C for 1 h in a reducing hydrogen atmosphere. Finally, metallized and nickel coated alumina ceramics has been brazed with another metallized and nickel coated alumina ceramics using CuAg filler alloy at 900 degrees C for 10 min in a vacuum furnace at 1 x 10(-6) Ton pressure. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis has been carried out for phase analysis, microstructural investigation and elemental composition analysis. The adhesive strength of the metallizing layer and brazing strength of the joint have been measured by pull down breaking strength method. SEM study has shown that the width of the interfacial reaction region between the metallizing layer and substrate enhances with increasing the impurity content in the alumina ceramics. It has been observed that the adhesive strength of the metallizing layer depends on the interfacial reaction layer thickness. The adhesive strength of the metallizing layer has been increased with increasing the thickness of interfacial reaction layer. High adhesive strength of the metallizing layer as well as brazing strength has been achieved for alumina ceramics with high impurity content.

AB Given the current strict regulations on fuel emissions, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles have been considered as ideal non-polluting vehicles. As the kernel subsystem of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, the fuel cell engine, which is a complex system, may fail because of multiple competing failure causes. In fuel cell engine reliability engineering, discriminating and measuring dependency among multiple failure causes is an urgent problem that should be addressed. This study proposes a statistical dependency analysis model under competing risks based on reliability field data of fuel cell engines. The multivariate lognormal distribution is employed to model joint failure distribution. Then, using simulated annealing algorithm to estimate the parameters of the conditional probability likelihood function. Moreover, p-value hypothesis test procedures are developed to determine the significance of the dependence degree among multiple competing failure causes. In this article, the failure mechanisms of fuel cell engine are comprehensively discussed to prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. Results can provide technical support for studies on optimal maintenance strategies.

AB Two high density structures beta- and gamma-LiAlH4 are detected in LiAlH4, a promising hydrogen storage compound, upon compression in diamond anvil cells, investigated with synchrotron X-ray diffraction and first-principle calculations. The joint of the experimental and theoretical results has confirmed the sequence of the pressure-induced structural phase transitions from alpha-LiAlH4 (space group P2(1)/c) to beta-LiAlH4 (P2(1)/c-6C symmetry), and then to gamma-LiAlH4 (space group Pnc2), which are not reported in previous literatures. At the alpha to beta transition point for LiAlH4, the estimated difference in cell volume is about 20%, while the transformation from beta to gamma phase is with a volume drop smaller than 1%. The alpha to beta phase transition is accompanied by the local structure change from a AlH4 tetrahedron into a AlH6 octahedron, which contributes to a large volume collapse.

SO WELDING IN THE WORLD

   Residual stresses
ID RESIDUAL-STRESS
AB The sustainable and resource-efficient production of wind energy plants requires the use of modern high-strength fine-grain structural steels. This applies to both foundation and erection structures, like mobile or ship cranes. During the assembly of steel structures, unacceptable defects can occasionally be found in the weld area. In most cases, the economical solution would be local thermal gouging of the affected areas and re-welding. Due to the high shrinkage restraint of the joint groove in the overall structure, the superposition of global and local welding-induced stresses may lead to crack formation and component failure, particularly in interaction with the degradation of the microstructure and mechanical properties of high-strength steels during the repair process. However, manufacturers hardly have any information about these issues and there is a lack of recommendations and guidelines to take these safety-relevant aspects into account in adequate repair concepts. The aim of this research is to derive recommendations for repair concepts appropriate to the stresses and materials involved providing a basis for standards and guidelines to avoid cold cracking, damage and expensive reworking especially for high-strength steels. Part 1 of this study involves systematic investigations of influences of shrinkage restraint during repair welding of two high-strength steels S500MLO for offshore application and S960QL for mobile crane structures. The quantification of the shrinkage restraint of repair weld joints was achieved by means of experimental and numerical restraint intensity analysis. In welding experiments with self-restrained slot specimens, restraint intensity and introduction of hydrogen via the welding arc using anti spatter spray were varied systematically to analyse the effect on welding result, residual stresses and cold cracking. It could be shown that increasing restraint intensities result in significantly higher transverse residual stress levels. In the case of hydrogen introduction S500MLO showed no cold cracking independent of the restraint conditions. However, S960QL was found to be considerably cold cracking sensitive if hydrogen is introduced. With increasing restraint intensity length and number of cold cracks increases significantly. Part 2 [1] of this study is focussed on microstructure and residual stresses due to gouging and stress optimization via adequate heat control parameters in repair welding.

AB Achieving high performance conductive hydrogel sensor which is capable of combining as many advantages as possible in one is highly desired to satisfy real-world tasks. To this end, novel hydrogel sensors PVA/NaDa (polyvinyl alcohol/D-Gluconic acid sodium salt) and PVA/NaLa (polyvinyl alcohol/L-Glutamic acid monosodium salt) have been successfully constructed via a facile and effective strategy. The hydrogels realize the combination of robust mechanical properties (stress, strain, elastic modulus, toughness, fatigue resistance, anti-breakage ability and recovery performance), excellent conductivity, sensitive sensitivity, rapid response capacity and high cytocompatibility. The increasing hydrogen bond cross-linking density and hydrogen bond interactions of NaDa (NaLa) with PVA are mainly responsible for significantly intensified mechanical properties of PVA/NaDa and PVA/NaLa hydrogels. Benefiting from the prominent performances, the hydrogels can be processed into flexible membrane sensors to not only effectively detect the human joint motions but also sensitively simulate manual control of the mobile phone screen for writing text, demonstrating a promising application in multifunctional intelligent robots, electronic skins, artificial intelligence and among others.

AB beta-Strands are formed by extended linear peptide chains that are usually paired to form beta-sheet structure through interstrand hydrogen bonding. Linking a structured organic molecule with alpha-amino acid(s) can enforce or stabilize beta-strand-like extended structures of the jointed amino acids. Spectroscopic and simulation studies indicated that the presence of a Cterminal 7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane amine (Abh) favors a beta-strand-like extended conformation of the adjacent alpha-amino acid on the N side. The bridgehead substitution of the Abh unit biases the amide cis-trans equilibrium of the adjacent alpha-amino acid residue to cis conformation. The proximity, specified by the presence of bond paths (such as H-H bond path) between the bridgehead proton of Abh and the alpha-proton of the alpha-amino acid provides a driving force favoring the extended conformation, which is independent of solvents. These results provide a basis for de novo design of beta-strand-mimicking extended peptides by using beta-strand enforcer/stabilizer even in the absence of the interstrand hydrogen bonding.

AB Ketol-isomerases catalyze the reversible isomerization between aldoses and ketoses. D-Xylose isomerase carries out the first reaction in the catabolism of D-xylose, but is also able to convert D-glucose to D-fructose. The first step of the reaction is an enzyme-catalyzed ring opening of the cyclic substrate. The active-site amino-acid acid/base pair involved in ring opening has long been investigated and several models have been proposed. Here, the structure of the xylose isomerase E1860 mutant with cyclic glucose bound at the active site, refined against joint X-ray and neutron diffraction data, is reported. Detailed analysis of the hydrogen-bond networks at the active site of the enzyme suggests that His54, which is doubly protonated, is poised to protonate the glucose 05 position, while Lys289, which is neutral, promotes deprotonation of the glucose O1H hydroxyl group via an activated water molecule. The structure also reveals an extended hydrogen-bonding network that connects the conserved residues Lys289 and Lys183 through three structurally conserved water molecules and residue 186, which is a glutamic acid to glutamine mutation.

AB The possible interactions near the triple-phase boundaries (TPB) metal/glass/air, and their effects on joint strength are investigated. Two types of samples (joined couples and glass coated coupons) are prepared with the coupon of AISI 430 (nickel plated and uncoated) and a slurry of compliant silicate sealing glass (SCN-1). The joined and coated samples are heated at 850 degrees C for 1000 h in air. The joined couples are cooled using two different schedules and then tested in uniaxial tension. For investigating the metal-oxides precipitation procedure in glass near the TPB, glass coated coupons are either cooled at the rate of 5 degrees C min(-1) or water-quenched from aging temperature. The mechanical test results and microstructural observations show that the spread and accelerated breakaway oxidation near TPB, which is due to continuous oxidation and dissolution of ferritic stainless steel (FSS) into the glass, leads to decreased and scattered low temperature joint strengths.

AB The IBARAKI biological crystal diffractometer (iBIX) was used in single-crystal time-of-flight neutron diffraction experiments on manganese catalase from Thermus thermophilus. The unit-cell dimensions were 133 x 133 x 133 angstrom, which is close to the designed maximum limitation of iBIX (135 x 135 x 135 angstrom). The optimum integration box sizes were set and the degree of integration box overlap was calculated for each Laue spot. Using the overlap ratio as the criterion, the selection of the diffraction intensity data was performed to give a minimum R-p.i.m.. Subsequently, diffraction intensity data from Laue spots with overlap ratios <= 0.1 were selected and a complete reflection data set with d(min) = 2.35 angstrom was obtained. Joint X-ray and neutron structure refinements were also successfully performed. It was difficult to determine the structures and protonation states of all the oxygen atoms in the manganese cluster owing to the disordered structure. No hydrogen atom was observed on the ordered mu -bridging oxygen atom O1003. Instead, this oxygen atom probably forms a hydrogen bond with Thr39. In addition, the refinements clearly showed the protonation states of the amino acid residues and hydrogen bonds, as observed in Tyr192, Glu167 and Glu280. This first neutron crystal structure of manganese catalase shows that iBIX can provide acceptable diffraction data for neutron single-crystal analyses of at least 2.4 angstrom resolution within the original targeted unit-cell dimensions of 135 x 135 x 135 angstrom.

AB The conductive hydrogel as a flexible sensor not only has certain mechanical flexibility but also can be used in the field of human health detection and human-computer interaction. Herein, by introduction of tannic acid (TA) with MXene into the polyacrylamide (PAM)/carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) double-network hydrogel, a hydrogel with high stretchability, self-adhesion, and high sensitivity was prepared. CMC and PAM form a semi-interpenetrating double-network of high toughness and durability through electrostatic interactions and multiple hydrogen bonding networks. The abundant hydrophilic functional groups on TA and MXene form multiple hydrogen bonds simultaneously with the polymer network, ensuring high stretchability and sensitivity of the hydrogel. The hydrogel can display an accurate response to a variety of stimulus signals and can monitor both human joint movements and small physiological signal changes. It can also be combined with deep learning algorithms to classify handwritten digits with an accuracy rate of 98%. This work can promote the application of hydrogel sensors with durability and high sensitivity. The combination of algorithms and flexible sensors provides important ideas for the further development of flexible devices.

AB To quantify the water absorbed by wheat in different soil layers and improve both wheat yields and water use efficiency (WUE), a 2-year conservation tillage and straw treatment experiment was implemented. This experiment involved four tillage methods, conventional tillage (C), subsoiling (S), rotary tillage (R), and no-tillage (N), and two straw treatments, straw return (W) and no straw return (0). The hydrogen, oxygen and carbon stable isotope method was used to evaluate the water source, grain yield, dry matter quantity and WUE of wheat as well as the relationships between Delta C-13 values of the wheat leaves, stems, ears and yield and the WUE under different tillage and straw treatment methods at the jointing and harvest stages. The results indicated that wheat water uptake occurred mainly within the 0-20 cm (86.22 %) soil layer at the jointing stage and within the 0-20 (56.36 %) and 20-40 cm (38.74 %) soil layers at the harvest stage. Compared with those in the C-0 treatment, the dry matter quantity in the S-W treatment increased by 14.86 % and 14.20 % respectively, at the jointing stage and the harvest stage; the grain yield in the S-W treatment significantly increased by 18 % at the harvest stage (P < 0.05); the WUEt and WUE, in the S-W treatment significantly increased by 46.21 % and 45.31 %, respectively, at the jointing stage (P < 0.05); and the WUEy increased by 5.69 % and 5.54 %, respectively, at the jointing stage and the harvest stage. The Delta C-13 vales of the wheat leaves, stems and ears were positively correlated with the yield, dry matter quantity and WUE of wheat. In conclusion, subsoiling with straw return should be adopted as a promising strategy for improving both wheat productivity and WUE and for retaining soil water availability. The Delta C-13 value of wheat organs can be used to indicate changes in wheat yield and WUE.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES

DE Enzyme-mediated reaction; pH-responsive crosslinking; Wound healing
ID BIOCATALYST; BENIGN
AB Self-healing hydrogels have attracted significant attention in chronic diabetic wound healing due to their potential to minimize the risk of secondary infections caused by joint movement or dressing rupture. Herein, a multifunctional self-healing hydrogel mediated utilizing an enzyme-triggered cascade reaction based on dynamic imine bonds was designed. The hydrogel employs three enzymes: lysozyme (LYZ), glucose oxidase (GOx), and catalase (CAT), as building blocks. GOx catalyzes the conversion of glucose and 1-thio-beta-D-glucose (beta-GlcSH) into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), gluconic acid (GA), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Subsequently, CAT eliminates H2O2, protecting the imine bonds from oxidative damage. The acidic environment created by GA decreases the pH and regulates the crosslinking density of imine bonds, enhancing the self-healing capability and porosity of the hydrogel. This feature enables the sustained release of the drug rosuvastatin calcium (RCa) to promote endothelial cell migration and vascular regeneration. Combined with the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of released H2S gas and the antibacterial properties of lysozyme, this hydrogel exhibits promising therapeutic efficacy for the synergistic treatment of chronic diabetic wounds.

ID SELECTIVE OXIDATION; G-C3N4; EVOLUTION
AB g-C3N4 as a new metal-free photocatalytic material for water splitting has attracted much attention in recent years, but its photocatalytic efficiency needs further improvement. Here we synthesized novel C-60/graphene/g-C3N4 composite photocatalytic materials with high hydrogen generation ability for water splitting under visible light radiation (lambda > 420 nm). These materials take full advantage of the electron conduction expressing of graphene and the superior-strong electron-attracting ability of C-60. The mutually-reinforcing synergy between graphene and C-60 improves the migration and utilization efficiency of photo-generated electrons and accelerates the separation of photo-generated charges, thus significantly enhancing the hydrogen generation capacity of g-C3N4. The hydrogen production amount and rate of C-60/graphene/g-C3N4 (10 mg/L C-60 and graphene) after 10 h are 5449.5 mu mol/g and 545 mu mol/g/h, which is 539.6 times of pure g-C3N4 under the same condition. The values are 50.8 and 4.24 times of graphene/g-C3N4 (10 mg/L graphene) and C-60/g-C3N4 (10 mg/L C-60), respectively. The apparent quantum yield of C-60/graphene/g-C3N4 (10 mg/L C-60 and graphene) in 97 h is about 7.2%. The improvement of hydrogen generation activity in 97 h suggests the high long-time stability of C-60/graphene/g-C3N4 in photocatalytic water spitting. The photocatalytic ability of C-60/graphene/g-C3N4 can be controlled by regulating the addition of graphene and C-60. The mutually-reinforcing synergy between graphene and C-60 was proved by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectrum and organic electron acceptors of MV2+. Thus, the joint action of C-60 and graphene promotes the migration, separation and utilization of photo-generated electrons, which is responsible for the significant enhancement of photocatalytic performance.

AB Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous neuromodulator produced mainly by the enzyme cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) in peripheral tissues. A pronociceptive role of endogenously produced H2S has been previously reported by our group in a model of orofacial inflammatory pain. Using the established persistent orofacial pain rat model induced by complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) injection into temporomandibular joint (TMJ), we have now investigated the putative role of endogenous H2S modulating hypemociceptive responses. Additionally, plasmatic extravasation on TMJ was measured following different treatments by Evans blue dye quantification. Thus, rats were submitted to Von Frey and Formalin tests in orofacial region before and after pharmacological inhibition of the CSE-H2S system combined or not with CFA-induced TMJ inflammation. Pretreatment with CSE inhibitor, propargylglycine (PAG; 88.4 mu mol/kg) reduced temporomandibular inflammatory pain when injected locally as well as systemically. In particular, local PAG injection seems to be more effective for hypemociceptive responses in orofacial persistent inflammation since its action is evidenced in the majority analyzed periods of the inflammatory process compared to its systemic use. Moreover, local injection seems to act on temporomandibular vascular permeability, evidenced by decreased plasmatic extra vacation induced by local PAG administration. Our data are consistent with the notion that the endogenous synthetized gas H2S modulates persistent orofacial pain responses revealing the pharmacological importance of the CSE inhibitor as a possible therapeutic target for their control.

AB Laser-electrochemical hybrid machining (LECM) is promising in the processing of thin-wall parts, which avoids problems such as the weak stiffness of structures and thermal defects. However, while most studies focus on precision machining via LECM, few investigate the potential of this technique in macro-area processing. In this paper, the synergistic effects on the coupling of thermal field and electrochemical field on bulk material removal mechanisms in the LECM of additively manufactured Ti6Al4V are comprehensively analyzed experimentally and theoretically. According to the experimental results, LECM improved the material removal rate (MRR) by up to 28.6% compared to ECM. The induction of the laser increases local heating, accelerating the temperature rise of the electrolyte, eventually promoting the electrochemical reaction. The hydrogen bubble flow promotes overall heat convection between the electrode and workpiece, which facilitates the removal of the facial precipitates and increases the efficiency of electrochemical dissolution. Higher voltages and laser powers promote the formation of hydrogen bubble flow; meanwhile, they also aggravate laser energy scattering, limiting the overall machining efficiency. Additionally, laser irradiation causes the ablation and rupture of hydrogen bubbles, which weakens the bubble flow effect and ultimately decreases the material removal efficiency. This study reveals the underlying mechanisms of the joint effects of the laser field and electrical field in LECM, and the findings can provide valuable insights for the optimization of LECM parameters in industrial applications.

AB Background: Thorough irrigation and debridement using an irrigation solution is a well-established treatment for both acute and chronic periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs). In the absence of concrete data, identifying the optimal irrigation agent and protocol remains challenging. Methods: A thorough review of the current literature on the various forms of irrigations and their additives was performed to evaluate the efficacy and limitations of each solution as pertaining to pathogen eradication in the treatment of PJI. As there is an overall paucity of high-quality literature comparing irrigation additives to each other and to any control, no meta-analyses could be performed. The literature was therefore summarized in this review article to give readers concise information on current irrigation options and their known risks and benefits. Results: Antiseptic solutions include povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine gluconate, acetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, hypochlorous acid, and preformulated commercially available combination solutions. The current literature suggests that intraoperative use of antiseptic irrigants may play a role in treating PJI, but definitive clinical studies comparing antiseptic to no antiseptic irrigation are lacking. Furthermore, no clinical head-to-head comparisons of different antiseptic irrigants have identified an optimal irrigation solution. Conclusion: Further high-quality studies on the optimal irrigation additive and protocol for the management of PJI are warranted to guide future evidence-based decisions. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB BACKGROUNDThe background of this study was analgesia in natural delivery. The combined spinal-epidural anesthesia has obvious analgesic effect on the parturients in natural labor, and combined spinal-epidural anesthesia has been widely used in anesthesia for various diseases.AIMTo study the effects of combined spinal-epidural anesthesia on anxiety, labor analgesia, and motor blocks in parturients during natural delivery.METHODSA total of 120 women who gave birth at Changning District Maternal and Child Health Hospital between December 2021 to December 2022 were included; a random number table approach was employed to divide the women into a control group and a joint group, with each group consisting of 60 women. The control group was given epidural anesthesia, while the joint group was given combined spinal-epidural anesthesia. The visual analog scale (VAS) was used to evaluate the degree of maternal pain. Comparisons were made between the two groups' conditions of childbirth and the duration of labor. Apgar scores were used to evaluate the status of the newborns at birth; Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) scores, umbilical artery blood gas analysis indices and stress indices were compared between the two groups; and the frequencies of motor block and postpartum complications were analyzed.RESULTSIn comparison to the control group, in the joint group, the VAS scores for the first, second, and third stages of labor were lower (P < 0.05). The rates of conversion to cesarean section and postpartum blood loss in the joint group were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in the Apgar score, the duration of the first stage of labor, or the total duration of labor between the two groups (P > 0.05). The second and third stages of labor in the joint group were shorter than those in the control group (P < 0.05). When compared to the control group, the postpartum SAS score of the joint group was lower, while the GSES score was greater (P < 0.05). Between the control group and the joint group, the differences observed in pH, arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure, arterial oxygen partial pressure, or arterial hydrogen ion concentration were not significant (P > 0.05). Nitric oxide, cortisol, and adrenaline levels were lower in the joint group than in the control group (P < 0.05). There were no substantial differences in Bromage grade or rate of complications between the two groups (P > 0.05).CONCLUSIONFor parturients during natural delivery, combined spinal-epidural anesthesia can reduce anxiety, provide labor analgesia, shorten labor time, and reduce postoperative stress levels but did not result in a motor block.

AB The anisotropic structure and dynamics of the hydration shell of a benzene solute in liquid water have been investigated by means of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations using the BLYP (Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr) and dispersion corrected BLYP-D functionals. The main focus has been to look at the influence of pi-hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions on the distance and angle resolved various structural and dynamic properties of solvation shell. The structure of hydration shell water molecules around benzene is found to be highly anisotropic as revealed by the radial distribution functions of different conical regions and joint radial/angular distribution functions. The benzene water dimer potential energy curves are calculated for a variety of orientations of water along the axial and equatorial directions for both BLYP and BLYP-D functionals. The simulation results of the hydration shell structure of benzene, particularly the axial and equatorial benzene water RDFs are discussed based on the differences in the benzene water potential energies for different orientations and functionals. The inter-particle distance/angle correlations show an enhanced water structure in the solvation shell of benzene compared to that between the solvation shell and bulk and also between the bulk molecules. On average, a single pi H-bond is found to be formed between water and benzene in the 45 axial conical region of the solvation shell. The pi H-bonded water molecules are found to have faster translational dynamics and also found to follow a fast jump mechanism of reorientation to change their hydrogen bonded partners. The presence of pi-hydrogen-bonded water makes the overall dynamics of the axial region faster than that of the equatorial region where the water molecules are hydrophobically solvated and hydrogen bonded to other water molecules.

AB We present a differentiable, end-to-end Bayesian forward modelling framework for line intensity mapping cosmology experiments, with a specific focus on low-frequency radio telescopes targeting the redshifted 21 cm line from neutral hydrogen as a cosmological probe. Our framework is capable of posterior density estimation of the cosmological signal jointly with foreground and telescope parameters at the field level. Our key aim is to be able to optimize the model's high-dimensional, non-linear, and ill-conditioned parameter space, while also sampling from it to perform robust uncertainty quantification within a Bayesian framework. We show how a differentiable programming paradigm, accelerated by recent advances in machine learning software and hardware, can make this computationally demanding, end-to-end Bayesian approach feasible. We demonstrate a proof of concept on a signal recovery problem for the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array experiment, highlighting the framework's ability to build confidence in early 21 cm signal detections even in the presence of poorly understood foregrounds and instrumental systematics. We use a Hessian-preconditioned Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm to efficiently sample our parameter space with a dimensionality approaching , N similar to 10(5) which enables joint, end-to-end nuisance parameter marginalization over foreground and instrument terms. Lastly, we introduce a new spherical harmonic formalism that is a complete and orthogonal basis on the cut sky relevant to drift-scan radio surveys, which we call the spherical stripe harmonic formalism, and it's associated three-dimensional basis, the spherical stripe Fourier-Bessel formalism.

AB With the growing adoption of renewable energy resources, microgrids (MGs) are increasingly relying on these sources to meet their electrical load demands. To ensure efficient operation, these units must be scheduled in a coordinated manner. This paper introduces a stochastic model for the joint scheduling of renewable and thermal energy units. The study focuses on integrating proton exchange membrane fuel cell-based combined heat and power (PEMFC-CHP) units, wind turbines (WTs), and photovoltaic (PV) systems within the scheduling framework. Additionally, hydrogen storage strategies are incorporated into the PEMFC-CHP operations. The model addresses uncertainties such as wind speed, solar irradiance, and market price fluctuations using a scenariobased approach. The proposed method formulates the scheduling problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINP) model, incorporating hydrogen storage strategies. The inherent uncertainties in these parameters further transform the problem into a stochastic MINP. Coordinated scheduling of renewable and thermal units within microgrids not only optimizes resource utilization but also enhances the overall objective function value. These advancements align with current energy policy objectives aimed at improving the efficiency and sustainability of energy systems. To solve the complex scheduling problem, this research employs an Improved Salp Swarm Algorithm (ISSA), which has been tested on a modified 33-bus distribution network. Simulation results indicate that the ISSA achieves over 5% higher revenue compared to other optimization methods. Furthermore, incorporating combined heat and power (CHP) operations increases the total system profit by more than 15%. The algorithm achieved the optimal result in 28 out of 30 attempts. The ISSA algorithm, with a remarkable success rate of 95.28%, demonstrates its effectiveness in minimizing MG operating costs, a critical component of energy policy goals.

AB Droughts not only reduce the biomass of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) but also increase the risk of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) toxicity to animals, mainly due to increased HCN content in drought-stressed plants. In the present study, the variations of HCN contents in 12 sorghum genotypes (10 sweet sorghum cultivars, one Sudangrass and one forage sorghum) were investigated at jointing, filling and ripening stages under rainfed conditions. Next, three genotypes - one sweet sorghum, one Sudangrass and one forage sorghum - were further selected to elucidate the physiological mechanisms of plant growth regulators (PGRs) (abscisic acid (ABA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA)) in mitigating the concentrations of HCN in drought-stressed plants in a pot experiment. About 100 mu g/L ABA and 100 mu g/L MeJA were sprayed separately or together twice on drought-stressed (50 and 75% field water capacity) plant leaf. The drought lasted for 15 days. In the field experiment the HCN content in plants reduced from jointing to filling stages then increased from filling to ripening stages in several cultivars. In the pot experiment, drought increased the HCN accumulation and soluble protein content in leaves of all three genotypes. PGRs overall reduced the HCN contents in drought-stressed sweet sorghum and Sudangrass but not in forage sorghum (except in the ABA+MeJA treatment). However, the soluble protein contents were reduced by PGRs in drought-stressed forage sorghum but not in sweet sorghum (except in the ABA+MeJA treatment) and Sudangrass. Both ABA and MeJA increased the plant weights, whereas only MeJA enhanced net photosynthetic rate (P-N) in all three genotypes. PGRs reduced release rate of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde in all drought-stressed plants, and reduced the activities of peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase in sweet sorghum but not in other two genotypes. These results suggest that exogenous ABA and MeJA could increase plant weight and reduce HCN content in drought-stressed sorghums, with varying physiological responsive mechanisms among sorghum genotypes.

AB This paper presents a mini-review of investigations performed by the authors in the field of hydrodynamic theory of lubrication of biological systems and synthetic processing of results to indicate the influence of biologically live material properties on biological liquid viscosity variations.
   The goal of the presented study was to demonstrate a new principle of a general mathematical theory applied to the mechanism of hydrodynamic lubrication of human joint cartilage surfaces with phospholipids bilayer and to indicate analytical solutions of hydrodynamic pressure, temperature and bio-fluid velocity components. Moreover, 3D variations of dynamic synovial fluid viscosity are assessed, particularly its variations across the entire film thickness.
   A new 3D analytical and numerical model has been elaborated on the basis of tribology methods, based on the assumptions of an ultra-thin boundary layer of non-Newtonian fluid. The analysed elements also included phospholipid concentrations, power hydrogen ion and collagen fiber concentrations in synovial, biological fluids, as well as electrostatic field, cartilage or biological surface wettability.
   The obtained results of our analysis demonstrate relationships which occur among hydrodynamic pressure, human joint load carrying capacity and phospholipid bilayer in the cartilage superficial layer. According to the best knowledge of the Authors, the obtained results may find applications in a broad scope of spatiotemporal models in biology and health science.

AB In the present work, a solid state environment-friendly methodology has been adopted to produce self-healing elastomers using commercial tire-grade polybutadiene rubber (BR) and butyl rubber (IIR). The elastomeric chains were directly grafted with optimized dosages of maleic anhydride followed by reactive mixing with ring opening amine-based adducts (e.g., 3-Amino-1, 2, 4-triazole) to create acid/amide-based supramolecular cooperative hydrogen bonds between elastomer chains, without any adverse effect on the intrinsic properties of the elastomers. Thus, modified elastomers in gum state were found to be have supramolecular cross-linking, that is, without applying any conventional vulcanizing agents. The tensile strength and tensile modulus of Modified BR, that is, BR-g-MAH (Tz) were enhanced by similar to 3.5% and similar to 7.5% respectively compared to commercial BR due to incorporation of hydrogen bonding network. The modified elastomers were also found to be thermo-responsive in which micro-cracks were healed in presence of thermal stimuli. Such healing could have been observed due to presence of reversible hydrogen-bonding based dissociation and association phenomenon. The thermo-reversible supramolecular hydrogen bonding was observed in H-1 NMR spectroscopy as well. Furthermore, such modified BR, when utilized in different pneumatic tire formulations, significantly improvement in dynamic property was observed as compared to tire formulation made using commercial grade BR. The modified elastomer showed potential to replace the commercial-grade elastomers for various conventional elastomers applications especially in tire sidewalls, tire tread etc. Additionally, such modified BR may improve tire life cycle, and thereby, reduces tire-waste generation. It may also find applications in non-tire sectors like conveyer belts, sealing joints, impact protection etc.

AB The methyl-substituted furan derivatives 2-methylfuran (2-MF) and 2,5-dimethylfuran (2,5-DMF) are often discussed as alternative fuels. Despite the large number of mechanistic studies on the pyrolysis and oxidation of 2-MF, 2,5-DMF, and unsubstituted furan (F), detailed kinetic investigations of the initial reaction steps are scarce. In this work, we report on shock-tube studies with detection of hydrogen atoms by atom resonance absorption spectroscopy to investigate the thermal decomposition of F, 2-MF, and 2,5-DMF. Hydrogen atom concentration-time profiles were recorded behind reflected shock waves at temperatures between 1200 and 1900 K and pressures between 0.7 and 1.6 bar with Ar as the bath gas. The recorded profiles were compared with results from kinetic simulations performed on the basis of a joint F/2-MF/2,5-DMF oxidation mechanism recently published. Kinetic parameters for a small number of reactions with high sensitivities for the formation and consumption of H atoms were adapted by taking values from other references to improve the agreement of the experimentally determined and simulated concentration-time profiles. In this way, an adequate description of the H atom concentration-time profiles for all three furan derivatives with the joint mechanism could be achieved. On the basis of this adapted mechanism, the formation pathways of H atoms in the pyrolysis of all three furan derivatives were identified and analyzed. It turned out that the formation of H atoms in the case of 2-MF and 2,5-DMF is governed by a competition between H split-off from the methyl group(s) of the reactant molecule as well as from the primary ring-opening product. In the case of F, only decomposition steps of the ring-opening product are relevant. The adapted mechanism is given in machine-readable form for modeling purposes, and the alterations made are discussed.

AB In this paper, a damaged fire tube of H-500 vessel in Naftshahr operational area was investigated. The damages were reported as circumferential cracks at the joint of the fire tube to oval flange, which was led to leakage at U-turn section, local corrosion at the welding lines and observing scales at the outer surfaces of the fire tube. Microstructure studies were conducted at different zones (base metal, HAZ, welding line and cracked areas) for a cracked U-turn of the fire tube using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and SEM/EDS analysis. The results showed that the initial microstructure of the fire tube was laminar ferritic-pearlitic, whereas, the heat affected zone of the welding line contained grain boundary and Widmanstatten ferrite. MnS particles were also seen in the microstructure with elongated morphology and circumferential cracks. At the HAZ of welding lines, step-wise cracking was observed as an accumulation of the voids around MnS particles. This could be an indicative of hydrogen induced cracking (HIC).
   Mechanical properties (hardness, impact energy and tensile strength) of the four studied zones were investigated and showed that all the properties were in agreement with the standard values for ASTM A516 Gr 70 N, the steel of the fire tube, and their variation was based on the microstructural evolution. Therefore, these results showed no probability of hydrogen embrittlement.

AB To obtain the optimal hydrogen-driven chemical reaction process for the preparation of Mg2Si as an anodic material of Li-ion batteries, the effects of the dehydrogenation temperatures on the structure and electrochemical properties are systematically investigated. The results indicate that Mg2Si prepared by isothermal dehydrogenation at 310 and 330 A degrees C exhibit better cycling stability than the samples prepared at 290 and 350 A degrees C due to the joint effects of the product purity and the particle size, especially for the 330 A degrees C-prepared sample. In particular, the initial discharge capacity of the Mg2Si prepared at 330 A degrees C is 1010 mAh/g with a coulombic efficiency of 92 %. After 50 cycles, the discharge capacity is approximately 416 mAh/g and the corresponding capacity retention is calculated to be approximately 41 %.

AB We report a joint experimental and theoretical studyon the reactivityof Ag- n  (+) clusters with H2S, D2O, and NH3. Complete dehydrogenationproducts are observed for Ag- n  (+) reacting with H2S, but no dehydrogenation products arefound for D2O or NH3 under the same reactioncondition. Theoretical calculations elucidate why Ag- n  (+) clusters show different reactivities with theseinorganic hydrides. NH3 shows strong coordination withAg( n ) (+), but the dehydrogenationreactions are unfavorable; in contrast, the fragile H-S bondsand stable Ag n S+ products facilitatethe hydrogen evolution of H2S on Ag- n  (+). We fully analyzed the metal-ligand interactionsof Ag- n  (+) clusters with threemolecules and illustrated the reaction dynamics and charge-transferinteractions and altered the superatomic states during the formationof cluster sulfides. We expect this study to benefit the design ofstable environmentally friendly desulfurization catalysts and alsothe understanding of the mechanism on ligand-protected metal clustersin wet chemistry.

AB Osteoarthritis (OA) is an irreversible disease of continuous degradation of cartilage, and natural joint super-lubrication is thought to provide hydrated lubrication to articular cartilage. Synovial joint fluid consists of hyaluronic acid (HA) and numerous brush-like macromolecules, exhibits a high affinity for cartilage proteins, and forms a hydrated layer on the cartilage surface. When cartilage friction increases, the surface layer of the cartilage becomes ruptured or damaged, and the cartilage hydration layer is destroyed, subsequently evolving into early OA. In this study, dopamine (DOPA) was coupled with HA to modify it by utilizing the hydrophilicity of HA and the adhesive properties of DOPA. On the one hand, it enhances cartilage lubrication by prolonging the retention time of HA in cartilage and restoring the hydrated layer on the cartilage surface by adhering to the type II collagen network. The successful synthesis of hyaluronic acid-DOPA (HAD) was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) hydrogen spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectroscopy. The morphology and hydrophilicity of HAD were demonstrated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and contact angle measurements. Additionally, the interaction of HAD with cartilage matrix proteins was verified through confocal microscopy imaging, while the biocompatibility and feasibility of injection of HAD were confirmed by cellular and animal experiments. On the other hand, the effect of protecting and even regenerating cartilage was achieved by remodeling the cartilage microenvironment. The cartilage protection and even regeneration ability of HAD was confirmed by injecting HAD at different times after OA modeling and characterizing the joints in sections.

AB The chirality of the protein backbone influences both self-assembly and biological activity. In ferrocene-containing peptides, the sequence and chirality of the constitutive amino acids as well as the structure of the ferrocene scaffold strongly influence the conformational properties, whereas the biological activity is more strongly influenced by lipophilicity. A joint spectroscopic and computational study has shown that a relatively simple structural modification, such as changing the order of two amino acids in the dipeptide sequence from Pro-Ala (III) to Ala-Pro (IV), also alters the hydrogen bonding patterns from a mostly ten-membered (beta-turn) to a seven-membered ring (gamma-turn), which affects the antiproliferative activity of the ferrocene peptidomimetics studied. A systematic approach presented in this study allowed us to highlight the relevant structural variations that could lead to increased biological activity in similar ferrocene-based bioconjugates.

AB The construction of heterojunctions is often considered an effective strategy for achieving solar driven photocatalytic decomposition of water. Graphdiyne has unique properties such as highly pi conjugated structure, ideal direct bandgap, and high charge carrier mobility, making it a candidate for ideal photocatalysts. In this work, a graphdiyne based composite catalyst GDY-Cu with ohmic contact interface was prepared through organic synthesis. Subsequently, a S-scheme heterojunction was constructed between the contact interface of WO3 nanorods with surface defects and GDY-Cu samples to promote electron transfer. The hydrogen evolution ability of GDYCu/WO3 samples with different ratios was studied by adjusting the addition amount of GDY-Cu. In addition, GDY-Cu/WO3 samples exhibits the highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, reaching 12.2 times that of pure GDY. In fact, the joint construction of Ohmic junctions and S-scheme heterojunctions provides a unique transport pathway for electron transfer. The built-in electric field between interfaces provides power for electron migration. Importantly, in-depth research on in-situ XPS and density functional theory calculations has confirmed the charge transfer pathway. Thorough charge dynamics analysis of the migration ability of photo generated charge carriers. This work not only enriches the photocatalytic system by integrating Ohmic junctions and S-scheme heterojunctions, but also provides a new design strategy for constructing graphdiyne based materials.

AB The HeH+ ion was the first molecule to form in the early Universe, and its comparatively large dipole moment renders it a potential coolant, relevant during the epoch of first star formation. The main destruction mechanisms under primordial conditions are recombination with free electrons and chemical reactions with hydrogen atoms. The latter process was believed to be slow at low temperatures, owing to a barrier forming along the reaction coordinate. Here we present a joint experimental and theoretical study of the reaction HeH+ + D -> HD+ + He that confirms the very recent proposition that the reaction is, in fact, barrierless and fast at low collision energies. The present evidence suggests that previous studies underestimated the low-temperature rate coefficient significantly because of an artifact in a widely used potential energy surface, and calls for a reassessment of the helium chemistry in the early Universe.

AB A line shape model that accounts for low-frequency fluctuations is applied to the Balmer series of the hydrogen isotopes (atomic transitions n -> 2). The plasma fluid parameters (density, temperature, etc.) are described as random variables characterized by a prescribed joint probability density function. A special emphasis is devoted to Stark broadened lines, which are sensitive to the plasma density. It is shown that fluctuations can lead to a significant increase of the line width if the fluctuation level Delta N-e/< N-e > (with < N-e > and Delta N-e being respectively the density averaged along the line-of-sight and its RMS value) is large.

AB The additive and antagonistic effects of the substrates and vapors on morphology of glycyl-glycine film were observed. The direction of joint effect significantly depends on the ability of the organic compound to form hydrogen bond. The vapors of strong H-donor or H-acceptor are able to overcome the interaction of the dipeptide molecules with substrate and change the film morphology. The Hansen solubility parameters can be used to predict the ability of vapors to initiate the self-assembly of dipeptide in solid state. The possible mechanism of glycyl-glycine self-assembly in solid state was proposed.

AB The proton-, lithium-, and sodium-bound cysteine dimers have been investigated in a joint computational and experimental infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) study. IRMPD spectra in the 1000-2000 cm(-1) region show that protonation is localized on an amine group, and that intermolecular hydrogen bonding occurs between the protonated amine and the carbonyl oxygen of the neutral Cys moiety. Alkali-bound dimers adopt structures reminiscent of those observed for the monomeric Cys center dot Li+ and Cys center dot Na+ species. Calculations of the heavier Cys(2)center dot M+ (M = K, Rb or Cs) species suggest that these are significantly less strongly bound than the lighter (M = H, Li, or Na) dimers.

AB A numerical investigation is carried out to study ignition events of different premixed stoichiometric fuel/air mixtures by hot exhaust gas jets. The simulations are performed for premixed, stoichiometric hydrogen/air, ethylene/air and propane/air mixtures in configurations relevant to safety applications. The ignition events of the different fuel/air mixtures by their corresponding exhaust gas jet are examined qualitatively analyzing processes and conditions leading to ignition. A stand-alone probability density function (PDF) method in connection with a projection method (PM) to calculate the mean pressure is used to model the turbulent flow. The transport equation for the joint velocity -turbulent frequency -scalar PDF is solved by a Monto Carlo/particle method. In order to reduce the computational costs concerning the chemical kinetics the reaction diffusion manifolds (REDIM) technique is used to get an appropriate reduced kinetic scheme.

The deposited diamondlike nanocomposite (DLN) films have been characterized using different spectroscopic techniques and tribological tests to understand the optimum deposition condition. The biocompatible nature of superior DLN film makes it a promising articulate knee and hip joint coating material.

AB To study the effect of surface physicochemical properties of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) on its interfacial bonding strength with adhesive, atmospheric pressure plasma treatment (APPT) using three gases (i. e., argon (Ar), nitrogen (N-2) and air (Air)) was conducted on surfaces of CFRP substrates. Atomic force microscope (AFM) observation indicates that APPT only changes the surface morphology of CFRP in a depth of tens of nanometers, and this minor change contributes little to the interfacial bonding strength of CFRP joints. X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses reveal that the release agent (mainly the -Si-CH3 group) and other contaminations on CFRP substrate surfaces were effectively removed by APPT, which improves the shear strength of CFRP joints from 8.6 MPa to 23.1 MPa. In addition, polar chemical functional groups (i.e., -NH2, -OH, -COOH) were generated on the CFRP substrate surfaces after APPT when nitrogen and air were used as plasma gases, which not only enhances the surface free energy of CFRP substrate but also combines with adhesive molecules through the form of hydrogen bonds and covalent bonds. With this mechanism, the shear strength of CFRP joints increased further to 28.7 MPa and 31.5 MPa when nitrogen and air were used as the plasma gases, respectively. After a quantitative study, the interfacial bonding strength between CFRP substrate and adhesive is expressed as a function of the concentration of -Si-CH3, -NH2 and -OH groups.

AB Bifunctional electrocatalysts with the joint merits of being highly efficient, stable, and low-cost are essential for overall water splitting applications. Herein, we reported a unique amorphous/crystalline coupling structure consisting of crystalline CoP nanocrystals with amorphous CoMoP in-situ growth on nickel foam (termed as CoP/a-CoMoP/NF). This was achieved through oxidation-phosphating in two successive steps by Keggin-type POM (H3PMo12O40) embedded into the zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) as the precursor. The Mo doping and crystalline/amorphous coupling structures of CoP and CoMoP modulate the electronic structure, increase the electrocatalytic active sites, and promote the interfacial electron transfer, thus accelerating the catalytic kinetics of both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The amorphous CoMoP serves a protective role in preventing corrosion during the electrochemical process. The catalyst exhibits low overpotentials of 301 mV and 250 mV to drive a current of 100 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER, respectively, and demonstrates excellent stability for both reactions. Furthermore, the alkaline electrolytic cell assembled with CoP/a-CoMoP/NF catalysts as both the anode and cathode requires only 1.66 V and 1.73 V to drive current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. This study offers a rational strategy for the development of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen generation.(c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Mechanical mixtures of nickel oxide and iron oxide doped with small quantities of ceria and alumina (2 wt%), have been tested as suitable solids to jointly produce and purify hydrogen from an equimolar mixture of CH4 and CO2 simulating a desulfurized biogas. Since the solid mixture constitutes a reactant within the system, most part of the experiments has been carried out in a thermogravimetric system acting as a differential reactor. Exhaust gases were continuously monitored by mass spectrometry at the exit of the thermobalance. The apparent reaction mechanism consists of a first stage in which CH4 reduces Fe2O3 (hematite) to Fe3O4 (magnetite) and NiO to metallic Ni. This newly formed metallic nickel adopts a catalytic role promoting the methane dry reforming (MDR) reaction between CH4 and CO2. Fe3O4 reduces to metallic iron (Fe-0) at the expense of H-2 and CO (products of MDR), that transform in the oxidized species H2O and CO2 respectively. This reaction displaces dry reforming towards products what avoids carbon formation at some extent. Carbon deposition has been detected at temperatures lower than 900 degrees C. These deposits were partially removed along isothermal experiments, probably by CO2 (Boudouard), and/or newly formed H-2 and CO (MDR). EDS analysis demonstrated that carbon is mostly formed on the surface of nickel particles, while Raman spectroscopy shows that this carbon was highly graphitized. Metallic iron can be reoxidized with steam in a subsequent stage releasing high purity hydrogen. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Transient Receptor Potential Ankyrin 1 Channel Expression on Peripheral

AB Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) suffer from pain and joint disability. The transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channel expressed on sensory neurones and non-neuronal cells mediates pain transduction and inflammation and it has been implicated in RA. However, there is little information on the contribution of TRPA1 for human disease. Here, we investigated the expression of TRPA1 on peripheral blood leukocytes and the circulating levels of its endogenous activators 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in RA patients treated or not with the anti-rheumatic leflunomide (LFN) or the anti-TNF alpha adalimumab (ADA). We also assessed whether TRPA1 expression correlates with joint pain and disability, in addition to the immune changes in RA. TRPA1 expression on peripheral blood leukocytes correlated with pain severity and disability. TRPA1 levels on these cells were associated with the numbers of polymorphonuclear and the activation of CD14(+) cells. No correlations were found between the lymphocyte population and TRPA1 expression, pain or disability. Patients recently diagnosed with RA expressed increased levels of TRPA1 on their leukocytes whilst treatment with either LFN or ADA down-regulated this receptor probably by reducing the numbers of polymorphonuclears and the activation of CD14(+) cells. We suggest that the activation levels of CD14(+) cells, the numbers of PMNs in the peripheral blood and the expression of TRPA1 on peripheral blood leukocytes correlate with RA progression, affecting joint pain sensitivity and loss of function.

AB The specificity of the available experimentally determined structures of amyloid forms is expressed primarily by the two- and not three-dimensional forms of a single polypeptide chain. Such a flat structure is possible due to the beta structure, which occurs predominantly. The stabilization of the fibril in this structure is achieved due to the presence of the numerous hydrogen bonds between the adjacent chains. Together with the different forms of twists created by the single R- or L-handed alpha-helices, they form the hydrogen bond network. The specificity of the arrangement of these hydrogen bonds lies in their joint orientation in a system perpendicular to the plane formed by the chain and parallel to the fibril axis. The present work proposes the possible mechanism for obtaining such a structure based on the geometric characterization of the polypeptide chain constituting the basis of our early intermediate model for protein folding introduced formerly. This model, being the conformational subspace of Ramachandran plot (the ellipse path), was developed on the basis of the backbone conformation, with the side-chain interactions excluded. Our proposal is also based on the results from molecular dynamics available in the literature leading to the unfolding of alpha-helical sections, resulting in the beta-structural forms. Both techniques used provide a similar suggestion in a search for a mechanism of conformational changes leading to a formation of the amyloid form. The potential mechanism of amyloid transformation is presented here using the fragment of the transthyretin as well as amyloid A beta.

AB We present a joint experimental and quantum chemical study on the influence of solvent dynamics on the protonation equilibrium in a strongly hydrogen bonded phenol-acetate complex in CD2Cl2. Particular attention is given to the correlation of the proton position distribution with the internal conformation of the complex itself and with fluctuations of the aprotic solvent. Specifically, we have focused on a complex formed by 4-nitrophenol and tetraalkylammonium-acetate in CD2Cl2. Experimentally we have used combined low-temperature H-1 and C-13 NMR and UV-vis spectroscopy and showed that a very strong OHO hydrogen bond is formed with proton tautomerism (PhOH center dot center dot center dot-OAc and PhO-center dot center dot center dot HOAc forms, both strongly hydrogen bonded). Computationally, we have employed ab initio molecular dynamics (70 and 71 solvent molecules, with and without the presence of a counter-cation, respectively). We demonstrate that the relative motion of the counter-cation and the "free" carbonyl group of the acid plays the major role in the OHO bond geometry and causes proton "jumps", i.e. interconversion of PhOH center dot center dot center dot-OAc and PhO-center dot center dot center dot HOAc tautomers. Weak H-bonds between CH(CD) groups of the solvent and the oxygen atom of carbonyl stabilize the PhOH center dot center dot center dot-OAc type of structures. Breaking of CH center dot center dot center dot O bonds shifts the equilibrium towards PhO-center dot center dot center dot HOAc form.

ID STAINLESS-STEEL WELDS; HYDROGEN
AB Keyhole gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) is a relatively new variant used for fabrication of pressure equipment where up to 10-mm-thick material can be autogenously welded in one pass. As the shielding gas used for keyhole mode is typically Ar + 5% H-2, the suitability of this method for welding of duplex stainless steels has been investigated. Duplex UNS S31803 and superduplex UNS S32750 schedule 40 seamless pipe was welded using a closed square butt joint configuration. Shielding gas compositions were applied with increasing nitrogen content in argon or argon-hydrogen mixtures. An investigation of the completed welds included examinations of the microstructure, corrosion and mechanical properties of the weld metal. All shielding gases resulted in high-quality welds free from defects, showed high strength and excellent corrosion resistance. Hydrogen additions increased the weld metal nitrogen loss and resulted in lower austenite formation. Ar + 5% H2 showed up to 20 vol.% less austenite than the gas types containing nitrogen and also showed the lowest impact toughness. At least 2% nitrogen would be recommended for optimizing the phase balance and impact toughness. Taking all aspects into account, Ar + 2% N-2 is the preferred shielding gas for welding duplex and superduplex with the keyhole GTAW process.

AB In this work we have found, that the water-soluble cis,mer-[IrH2Cl(mtppms)3] (mtppms = monosulfonated triphenylphosphine Na-salt) was an excellent catalyst for reduction of terminal alkynes by hydrogen transfer from aqueous HCOOH/HCOONa mixtures. The conversions strongly depended on the pH of the reaction mixtures, and the highest rate of phenylacetylene transfer hydrogenation was observed at pH 3. The same dihydrido-Ir(III) complex actively catalyzed also the hydrogenation of terminal alkynes under mild conditions (T = 50 ?C; P (H2) = 2?10 bar). Importantly, both the hydrogenation and hydrogen transfer reductions afforded exclusively the corresponding alkenes as products. Phenylacetylene and its substituted derivatives reacted smoothly, while benzylic and aliphatic alkynes were less reactive or did not react at all. It was also found, that an excess of the mtppms ligand inhibited the reaction. This was rationalized by formation of cisz-[IrH2(mtppms)4]+ which was also confirmed with multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. On the basis of the experimental results, a joint mechanism was suggested for both the hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation pathways. The mechanism of hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation of phenylacetylene was also studied by DFT calculations, which revealed several possibilities for protonation of a vinyl intermediate as the crucial step in formation of the styrene product.

AB Thin-film transistors (TFTs) in practical operations are inevitably impacted by moisture and temperature. An investigation on the joint effect of environmental moisture and working temperature on device characteristics and instability is becoming necessary. However, few related studies have been performed. In this work, a low-temperature (LT) annealing in air is proposed to simulate the working conditions of TFTs in display applications. The effect of moisture exchange caused by LT annealing on device characteristics and instability of InSnZnO (ITZO) TFTs is systematically investigated. Combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, TCAD design simulation, and the measurement of relative humidity (RH) change on the device surface, a model considering water diffusion and water ionization is proposed. The negative shift of the transfer curve is attributed to the extra electrons released from the water ionization and the positive-bias-stress-induced instability is mainly attributed to the generation of interstitial/substitutional hydrogens and aggregation of hydrogen ions at the backchannel. The temperature and the RH on the device surface jointly determine the moisture diffusion direction. Furthermore, the model is verified by an LT vacuum annealing. The results and the model will be beneficial for the further reliable design of ITZO TFTs in commercial applications.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate a multilayer structure made of polyethylene and polyamide by rotational molding. Due to the different polarity of these polymers, it is difficult to ensure enough adhesion between created layers. Two methods leading to improve adhesion are introduced. Plasma modification of polyethylene powder, after which new functional groups are bound to the treated surface, may enhance specific adhesion by forming hydrogen bonds with-CONH groups of polyamide. Different strategies of adding material to the mold give rise to complicated interlayer which increases joint strength by mechanism of the mechanical adhesion. Mechanical tests show a significant improvement of joint strength, where treated samples reached two-fold values of peel strength (7.657 +/- 1.024 N center dot mm(-1)) against the untreated sample (3.662 +/- 0.430 N center dot mm(-1)). During bending test, delamination occurred only in samples that were made of the untreated polyethylene. Adding polyamide during the melting stage of polyethylene powder in rotomolding resulted in the formation of entanglements which improve the peel strength almost eight times in comparison with the sample where the polyethylene was left to completely melt and create smooth interlayer surface.

AB Conductive hydrogels are ideal materials for preparing wearable strain sensing devices due to their flexibility and stretchability. However, most hydrogels exhibit poor freezing resistance and weak water-holding ability, thus hindering the working range of hydrogel-based sensors in extreme environments. Here, a conductive hydrogel featuring conspicuous anti-freezing and water retention abilities was prepared by integrating amylose (AMY) into a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/glycerol/NaCl hydrogel. AMY possesses a number of hydroxyl groups, which could interact with PVA and glycerin via hydrogen bonds, enhancing the toughness of the hydrogel. Meanwhile, based on the strong hydrogen bonding between glycerol and water molecules, the hydrogel displayed water-retaining properties after 7 days of storage in an open environment. The synergistic action of NaCl and glycerol prevented the crystallization of water at low temperatures, endowing the hydrogel with outstanding conductivity and stretchability at -20 degrees C. Furthermore, the hydrogel-based wearable strain sensor exhibited excellent sensitivity (GF = 2.55), fast response/recovery time, and good durability and biocompatibility, which accurately detected joint movements and physiological signals at room temperature or under extreme conditions. Therefore, conductive hydrogels would possess significant application prospects in health detection, disease diagnosis, and artificial intelligence.

AB Genomic prediction (GP) offers great opportunities for accelerated genetic gains by optimizing the breeding pipeline. One of the key factors to be considered is how the training populations (TP) are composed in terms of genetic improvement, kinship/origin, and their impacts on GP. Hydrogen cyanide content (HCN) is a determinant trait to guide cassava's products usage and processing. This work aimed to achieve the following objectives: (i) evaluate the feasibility of using cross-country (CC) GP between germplasm's of Embrapa Mandioca e Fruticultura (Embrapa, Brazil) and The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA, Nigeria) for HCN; (ii) provide an assessment of population structure for the joint dataset; (iii) estimate the genetic parameters based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a haplotype-approach. Datasets of HCN from Embrapa and IITA breeding programs were analyzed, separately and jointly, with 1,230, 590, and 1,820 clones, respectively. After quality control, similar to 14K SNPs were used for GP. The genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) were predicted based on SNP effects from analyses with TP composed of the following: (i) Embrapa genotypic and phenotypic data, (ii) IITA genotypic and phenotypic data, and (iii) the joint datasets. Comparisons on GEBVs' estimation were made considering the hypothetical situation of not having the phenotypic characterization for a set of clones for a certain research institute/country and might need to use the markers' effects that were trained with data from other research institutes/country's germplasm to estimate their clones' GEBV. Fixation index (F-ST) among the genetic groups identified within the joint dataset ranged from 0.002 to 0.091. The joint dataset provided an improved accuracy (0.8-0.85) compared to the prediction accuracy of either germplasm's sources individually (0.51-0.67). CC GP proved to have potential use under the present study's scenario, the correlation between GEBVs predicted with TP from Embrapa and IITA was 0.55 for Embrapa's germplasm, whereas for IITA's it was 0.1. This seems to be among the first attempts to evaluate the CC GP in plants. As such, a lot of useful new information was provided on the subject, which can guide new research on this very important and emerging field.

AB This study experimentally investigates the application of a novel high-entropy alloy (HEA) filler, Co10Cr8Cu20Fe6Mn27Ni29, developed through thermodynamic calculations, in the brazing of Hastelloy X under a hydrogen atmosphere with three distinct brazing durations of 60, 90, and 120 min. The HEA filler was synthesized via mechanical alloying over a period of 60 h. The characterization techniques, including x-ray diffraction (XRD), indicated a lattice strain of 0.01% and a reduction in crystallite size to 66.19 nm. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results revealed a melting temperature of 1116 degrees C for the HEA filler. The shear strength of the samples was evaluated, achieving a maximum value of 283 MPa at 60 min, representing the highest shear strength recorded in this investigation. The results indicated that the sluggish diffusion characteristics of high-entropy alloys may reduce undesirable interactions with the superalloy substrates during brazing at elevated temperatures, thereby inhibiting the formation of detrimental secondary phases through restricted interdiffusion at the joint interface. However, prolonged brazing times led to increased continuity and porosity of brittle chromium-manganese oxide compounds along the grain boundaries, potentially compromising joint performance.

AB Triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) is a key enzyme in glycolysis that catalyses the interconversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. This simple reaction involves the shuttling of protons mediated by protolysable side chains. The catalytic power of TIM is thought to stem from its ability to facilitate the deprotonation of a carbon next to a carbonyl group to generate an enediolate intermediate. The enediolate intermediate is believed to be mimicked by the inhibitor 2-phosphoglycolate (PGA) and the subsequent enediol intermediate by phosphoglycolohydroxamate (PGH). Here, neutron structures of Leishmania mexicana TIM have been determined with both inhibitors, and joint neutron/X-ray refinement followed by quantum refinement has been performed. The structures show that in the PGA complex the postulated general base Glu167 is protonated, while in the PGH complex it remains deprotonated. The deuteron is clearly localized on Glu167 in the PGA-TIM structure, suggesting an asymmetric hydrogen bond instead of a low-barrier hydrogen bond. The full picture of the active-site protonation states allowed an investigation of the reaction mechanism using density-functional theory calculations.

AB With the development of science and technology, the need for high performance sensors is more and more urgent to deal with different needs and environments. In this study, a flexible strain sensor with performance of self-healing is developed based on porous nickel as conductive filler and polyurethane (PU) with hydrogen bonding, disulfide bond, and metal coordination bond as polymer matrix. Porous nickel is prepared by a new biotemplates method, and the effects of reaction temperature and concentration of NiCl2 center dot 6H(2)O on the morphology of porous nickel are studied. Polyurethanes containing hydrogen bonding, disulfide bonds, and metal coordination bonds are prepared, and the mechanical properties and self-healing properties of polyurethanes with different contents of hard and soft segments are studied. A strain sensor is prepared by mixing porous nickel and polyurethane. The effect of filler content on mechanical properties, self-healing properties, and electrical self-healing properties is studied. The sensor is attached to the joints of human limbs, and the peak diagram of time-relative resistance changes is obtained through the cyclic and repeated movements of the limbs. The sensor has excellent sensitivity.

ID GAMMA-RAY BURSTS
AB The joint observation of core-collapse supernovae with gamma-ray bursts shows that jets can be launched in the aftermath of stellar core collapse, likely by a newly formed black hole that accretes matter from the star. Such gamma-ray bursts have only been observed accompanying Type Ibc supernovae, indicating a stellar progenitor that lost its hydrogen envelope before collapse. According to recent hypothesis, it is possible that jets are launched in core-collapse events even when the progenitors still retain their hydrogen envelopes; however, such jets are not able to burrow through the star and will be stalled into the interior of the progenitor star before escaping. These jets are called choked jets. High-energy neutrinos produced by such choked jets could escape the stellar envelope and could be observed. Here, we examine how multimessenger searches for high-energy neutrinos and core-collapse supernovae can detect or limit the fraction of stellar collapses that produce jets. We find that a high fraction of jet production is already limited by previous observational campaigns. We explore possibilities with future observations using Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, IceCube, and Km3NET.

AB Subgrid correlation of mixture fraction, Z, and progress variable, c, is investigated using direct numerical dimulation (DNS) data of a hydrogen lifted jet flame. Joint subgrid behaviour of these two scalars are obtained using a Gaussian-type filter for a broad range of filter sizes. A joint probability density function (JPDF) constructed using single-snapshot DNS data is compared qualitatively with that computed using two independent -PDFs and a copula method. Strong negative correlation observed at different streamwise locations in the flame is captured well by the copula method. The subgrid contribution to the Z-c correlation becomes important if the filter is of the size of the laminar flame thickness or larger. A priori assessment for the filtered reaction rate using the flamelet approach with independent -PDFs and correlated JPDF is then performed. Comparison with the DNS data shows that both models provide reasonably good results for a range of filter sizes. However, the reaction rate computed using copula JPDF is found to have a better agreement with the DNS data for large filter sizes because the subgrid Z-c correlation effect is included.

AB New measurements are reported of the soot-temperature interaction in a turbulent non-premixed ethylene-hydrogen-nitrogen attached jet flame with an exit Reynolds number of 15,000. Spatially resolved, two-dimensional temperature and soot volume fractions were measured simultaneously using non-linear excitation regime two-line atomic fluorescence (NTLAF) and laser-induced incandescence (LII) techniques, respectively. The soot-temperature correlation is presented and analyzed through representative images of single-shot simultaneous temperature and soot volume fraction at various heights, as well as through joint probability density functions (PDFs) of soot volume fraction (SVF) and temperature. A strong influence of temperature on SVF is found, which is consistent with current understanding of their inter-dependence. Axial and radial plots of mean SVF categorized into temperature bands of 300 K are also reported. These reveal that, while the mean SVF is a function of both temperature and axial distance, the joint PDF depends only weakly on radial distance. The study highlights the value of the simultaneous measurements for understanding soot behavior in a turbulent environment and for model development and validation. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute.

AB Developing a meniscus substitute that meets high in vivo demands of toughness, anti-fatigue, and lubrication remains a great challenge. Herein, a zwitterionic polyurethane (PU) prepolymer is synthesized through the reaction of sulfobetaine-based diol, polycarbonate diol, and hexamethylene diisocyanate. The zwitterionic PU prepolymer is then chain-extended by adipic acid dihydrazide to form multiple hydrogen-bonded crosslinked zwitterionic supramolecular polyurethane. By regulating the hydrogen bonds in the hard segment and hydration under the aqueous environment, the introduced zwitterionic side group can significantly enhance the toughness, printability, and lubrication of PU elastomer. By using the fused deposition modeling three-dimensional (3D) printing technology, the zwitterionic PU meniscus scaffold with robustness, toughness and lubrication was customized without any other post-treatment. In swelling equilibrium, the printed zwitterion-PU construct demonstrates Young's modulus of 16.87 +/- 2.00 MPa, toughness of 19.90 +/- 5.94 MJ m(-3), tear energy of 12.51 +/- 1.57 kJ m(-2), and excellent fatigue resistance. The 3D-printed zwitterionic PU meniscus replacement is implanted into the rabbits' knee joint for 12 weeks with the in vivo result demonstrating an appealing capability to efficiently alleviate the cartilage surface wear.

AB We report a joint experimental and theoretical study of the gas-phase reactions between rhodium clusters Rh-n(+) (n=1-24) and small hydrocarbons. It is found that most Rh-n(+) clusters react with CH4 to form absorption products Rh-n(CH4)(1,2)(+) but Rh-3(+) reacts to form carbide indicative of complete dehydrogenation; Rh-2(+) reacts with CH4 to form partial dehydrogenation products Rh2CH2+ and Rh2C2H6+. The distinctive reactivity of Rh-3(+) is also found for the reactions with C2H2, C2H4 and C2H6, where the complete dehydrogenation product Rh3C2+ is also formed. Analysis of reaction kinetics demonstrates that the cooperation of three Rh atoms plays a key role in the dehydrogenation reaction. Notably, Rh-3(+) bears a large HOMO-LUMO gap and reasonable stablity, and the roughly equal contribution of electrostatic and orbital interactions provide advantages to form two symmetric Rh-H-C hydrogen bridge bonds which promote the synergic cluster catalysis for hydrogen atom transfer and C-H bond dissociation. The efficient dehydrogenation mediated by an Rh-3(+) cluster opens a window to design new catalysts for C-H activation.

AB The synthesis and the structural characterization of a cyclic hexapeptoid with four methoxyethyl and two propargyl side chains have disclosed the presence of a hydrate crystal form [form (I)] and an anhydrous crystal form [form (II)]. The relative amounts of form (I) and form (II) in the as-purified product were determined by Rietveld refinement and depend on the purification procedures. In crystal form (I), peptoid molecules assemble in a columnar arrangement by means of side-chain-to-backbone C=CH center dot center dot center dot OC hydrogen bonds. In the anhydrous crystal form (II), cyclopeptoid molecules form ribbons by means of backbone-to-backbone CH2 center dot center dot center dot OC hydrogen bonds, thus mimicking beta-sheet secondary structures in proteins. In both crystal forms side chains act as joints among the columns or the ribbons and contribute to the stability of the whole solid-state assembly. Water molecules in the hydrate crystal form (I) bridge columns of cyclic peptoid molecules, providing a more efficient packing.

AB The joint effect of Bacillus subtilis 26D endophytic bacteria and chitooligosaccharides (COSs) on the resistance of potato plants (Solanum tuberosum L.) to the late blight causative agent Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) De Bary was studied. A twofold decrease in the area of late-blight lesions on potato leaves was revealed during the joint presowing treatment of minitubers with B. subtilis bacteria (10(8) cells/mL) with COSs (1 mg/L). Treatment with COSs was found to have similar protective effect on potato plants, but this was not observed with the use of only bacteria. The mechanisms of increased potato-plant resistance to P. infestans were associated with the activation of catalase, peroxidase, and hydrolases (amylase and protease) inhibitors, the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, and transcripts of genes encoding PR proteins: amylase inhibitor, basic protective protein (PR-1), chitinase (PR-3), protease inhibitor (PR-6), peroxidase (PR-9). The revealed activation of the gene expression of the main antimicrobial protein PR-1 (a marker of the development of systemic acquired resistance) and PR-6 (a marker of the development of induced systemic resistance) under the influence of combined treatment with B. subtilis and COSs indicates that the development of protective reactions in potato plants to the late blight pathogen in this case occurs synergistically, with the participation of various signaling pathways, in which B. subtilis prime protective genes, and COSs act as a trigger for their expression.

AB Based on quantum-mechanical path-integral molecular dynamics simulations, the impact of nuclear quantum effects on the vibrational and hydrogen bond dynamics in liquid water is investigated. The instantaneous fluctuations in the frequencies of the O-H stretch modes are calculated using the wavelet method of time-series analysis, while the time scales of the vibrational spectral diffusion are determined from frequency-time correlation functions, joint probability distributions, and the slope of three-pulse photon echo. We find that the inclusion of nuclear quantum effects leads not only to a redshift of the vibrational frequency distribution by around 130 cm(-1) but also to an acceleration of the vibrational dynamics by as much as 30%. In addition, quantum fluctuations also entail a significantly faster decay of correlation in the initial diffusive regime, which is in agreement with recent vibrational echo experiments.

AB Pseudocapacitors have been experimentally studied for many years in electric energy storage. However, first principles understanding of the pseudocapacitive behavior is still not satisfactory due to the complexity involved in modeling electrochemistry. In this paper, we applied joint density functional theory (JDFT) to simulate the pseudocapacitive behavior of RuO2, a prototypical material, in a model electrolyte. We obtained from JDFT a capacitive curve which showed a redox peak position comparable to that in the experimental cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve. We found that the experimental turning point from double-layer to pseudocapacitive charge storage at low scan rates could be explained by the hydrogen adsorption at low coverage. As the electrode voltage becomes more negative, H coverage increases and causes the surface-structure change, leading to bended - OH bonds at the on-top oxygen atoms and large capacitance. This H coverage-dependent capacitance can explain the high pseudocapacitance of hydrous RuO2. Our work here provides a first principles understanding of the pseudocapacitance for RuO2 in particular and for transition-metal oxides in general.

AB In the review of the successful solar thermal electrochemical process (STEP) of acrylonitrile oxidation for the effective wastewater treatment, the process was actually driven by solar two fields-thermofield and electrofield, essentially activated and motivated for both thermochemistry and electrochemistry. In this paper, the synergistic system of solar three fields, induced by the primary photofield, and sub-thermofield and sub-electrofield, was designed and employed firstly for promoted the efficiency of the solar utilization and pollutant oxidation plus hydrogen production. With the correlative action, the three sub chemical processes were induced by the solar three fields. The action actually conducted a three-field synergy of solar energy with a combination of the thermo-activation, photo catalysis and electrochemistry of the pollutant oxidation. Exemplified by acrylonitrile, the solar oxidation plus hydrogen production was theoretically and experimentally investigated by the single-field, coupled two-fields and coupled three-fields patterns. The results indicated that the coupled three-field pattern achieved high efficiencies in the solar utilization and oxidative reaction plus the hydrogen production, which was superior to ones of the single or two fields. The solar thermofield enables that the activated acrylonitrile was apt to be thermally decomposed, greatly in favor of the subsequent photo- and electrooxidation. The photocatalytic efficiency driven by the single photofield was reached at a rate of 31.01%. The electrolysis efficiency powered by single electrofield gained a rate of 24.56%. For the combination of the solar three-field pattern, the oxidation efficiencies run up to a rates of 32.74%, 38.06%, 55.01% and 76.01% during 60 min at the 25 degrees C, 40 degrees C, 60 degrees C, 75 degrees C, respectively. Especially, a joint of the coupled field realized the 6.38 times of the COD removal rate of acrylonitrile in comparison with the single field pattern. Due to the easy anodic oxidation of acrylonitrile and operation under the high temperature, the cathodic reduction of water was enhanced for the production of hydrogen in the electrolysis of the less potential plus an addition of photocatalysis. The experimental data and mechanistic analysis significantly revealed that the system achieved such a synergetic action. The full mineralization plus the hydrogen production was attributed to a coupling and matching integration of the solar three fields and subchemistries. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB N-Doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have recently emerged as potential organic electronic materials. The function of such materials is determined not only by the intrinsic electronic properties of individual molecules but also by their supramolecular interactions in the solid state. Therefore, a proper characterization of the interactions between the individual units is of interest to materials science since they ultimately govern properties such as excitons and charge transfer. Here, we report a joint experimental and computational study of two azaphenanthrene dimers to determine the structure and the nature of supramolecular interactions in the aggregates. IR/UV double resonance experiments were carried out using far-and mid-infrared free-electron laser radiation. The experimental spectra are compared with quantum chemical calculations for the lowest-energy pi-stacked and hydrogen-bonded structures. The data reveal a preference of the pi-stacked structure for the benzo[f]quinoline and the phenanthridine dimer.

AB The water stable UiO-66(Zr)-(CO2H)(2) MOF exhibits a superprotonic conductivity of 2.3x10(-3)Scm(-1) at 90 degrees C and 95% relative humidity. Quasi-elastic neutron scattering measurements combined with aMS-EVB3 molecular dynamics simulations were able to probe individually the dynamics of both confined protons and water molecules and to further reveal that the proton transport is assisted by the formation of a hydrogen-bonded water network that spans from the tetrahedral to the octahedral cages of this MOF. This is the first joint experimental/modeling study that unambiguously elucidates the proton-conduction mechanism at the molecular level in a highly conductive MOF.

AB Adhesive 2-layer lamination joints of 18mass%Cr-8mass%Ni austenite stainless steel and carbon fiber reinforced polymer (18-8/CFRP) were prepared using a new adhesion method consisting of applying low dose of 0.13 MGy of homogeneous low energy electron beam irradiation (HLEBI) to connecting surfaces of the 18-8 and CFRP prior to assembly and hot-pressing in vacuum under atmospheric pressure of about 1 Pa for 2 h at 401 +/- 0.5 K. Although untreated 18-8/CFRP joint exhibited decent adhesion by hot-pressing, application of 0.13 MGy HLEBI dose apparently improved the adhesive force of peeling resistance (degrees F-p) of the 18-8/CFRP joint 145% at median accumulative peeling probability (P-p = 0.50) from 18.9 to 27.4 Nm(-1). In addition, the statistically lowest degrees F-p for safety design (F-s at P-p= 0) iterated by the 3-parameter Weibull equation was raised from zero for the untreated to 5.2 Nm(-1) for the 0.13 MGy samples indicating increased reliability by the HLEBI. The higher adhesive strength induced by HLEBI was explained by results of XPS (X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) observations of the peeled surface of 18-8 side of lamination with and without 0.13 MGy-HLEBI. 0.13 MGy-HLEBI slightly increased the number of C=C bonds instead of slightly decreasing the numbers of C-C, C-H and O=C-O bonds near 18-8/CFRP interface. In addition, both increasing oxygen atoms and decreasing hydrogen atoms strongly attributed to bonding force at interface of epoxy of 18-8/CFRP. Since the experimental data showed the optimum HLEBI dose was about 0.13 MGy, above which at 0.13 MGy the degrees F-p began to drop, carefulness in optimization was highly recommended when applying in industry to insure safety.

AB The demand for renewable energy has prompted an increasing interest in wind turbine technology, where efficient and reliable brake systems play a critical role in ensuring safety and performance. This study investigates the brazing process to join sintered iron to mild steel for wind turbine brake pad applications. The sintered iron components were synthesized using iron powder with an average particle size of 30 mu m and sintered at different temperatures under vacuum and hydrogen environments. Eutectic CuSil with added copper powder was employed as the brazing alloy to join the sintered iron and mild steel. The brazed joints were characterized using various techniques, including optical microscope, scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope, X-ray diffractometer, and microhardness tester. The microhardness of the sintered iron was similar to 580 HV for SICV and similar to 620 HV for SICH due to oxide formation during processing. The microhardness of the braze joint was 72 HV, and mild steel exhibited 110 HV. Tribological testing was performed to analyze the wear behavior of the sintered iron specimens (before and after the brazing). SICH specimens showed a wear rate of 1.3 x 10-4 g/Nm, and SICV specimens exhibited a wear rate of 5.3 x 10-4 g/Nm. Brazing the sintered iron component (SICV) with mild steel using eutectic CuSil and a modified assembly method in a vacuum successfully achieved a satisfactory joint with improved wear resistance. The study emphasizes the potential of this approach for efficient and reliable brake pad fabrication for wind turbines.

AB In the ever-evolving field of hydrogen storage technologies, metal hydrides, especially those derived from intermetallic compounds, stand out as promising solutions for safe, efficient, and reliable hydrogen storage. Among these, AB3 compounds are noteworthy for exhibiting interesting characteristics such as high storage capacity. In this study, we investigate the Y0.88Ni3-xMnx system (x = 0.1; 0.2; 0.3; 0.4; 0.8 and 1) due to its low density and fundamental interest. The compounds were synthesised by arc-melting followed by annealing at 1173 K for 3 days. X-ray diffraction revealed that the lattice parameters of the AB3 phase do not vary linearly with Mn content, suggesting a non-random distribution of Mn atoms. Given the limited scattering contrast between Mn and Ni in X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction was employed to determine Mn occupancy. Joint refinement of synchrotron X-ray and neutron diffraction patterns showed that for Mn contents up to x = 0.3, Mn occupies both Y-sites within the [A2B4] subunits and Ni-sites within the [AB5] subunits. At higher Mn concentrations, Mn also occupies Ni-sites at the boundary between [A2B4] and [AB5] subunits. The evolution of lattice parameters strongly correlates with these variations in Mn occupancy. Notably, Y0.88Ni2.7Mn0.3 and Y0.88Ni2.6Mn0.4 exhibit nearly equal [AB5] and [A2B4] subunit volumes, making them strong candidates for reversible hydrogen. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to complement experimental results and reveal thermodynamic mechanism behind the dual-site substitution of Mn and Mn site occupancy behaviour with respect to Mn content across different sites.

AB Despite widespread use of antioxidants, reactive oxygen species have important functions in normal tissues. Herein, we present an example of a physiological role for free radicals, and in particular, reactive oxygen species, that are suppressed by anti-oxidants. Free radicals catalyze the degradation of hyaluronan in synovial fluid, a tissue in which hyaluronidase activity is barely detectable. Articular cartilage requires a low oxygen environment. The process of hyaluronan peroxidation consumes significant amounts of molecular oxygen, thus keeping the tension of oxygen in the joint at a low but physiologically critical level. One concern is the change in physical activity between day and night, with periods of joint hyperemia and ischemia, respectively. Increased oxygen and the resulting oxidative stress would lead to chondrocyte dysfunction and cartilage damage. A mechanism for keeping oxygen levels low is required. We postulate that a mechanism indeed exists for the removal of excess oxygen. High-molar-mass hyaluronan turnover in synovial fluid utilizes peroxidative degradation, during which oxygen is massively consumed. The peroxidation itself may be initiated by hydrogen peroxide, which is produced by chondrocyte mitochondria, that can diffuse into the synovial fluid. The resulting decrease in available oxygen down-regulates hyaluronan peroxidation. This in turn prevents excessive oxygen consumption. It appears that free radicals and reactive oxygen species may be components of normal physiology, particularly in the synovial fluid of joints and articular cartilage. It is suggested therefore that indiscriminate use of antioxidants, vigorously promoted currently by health professionals and the health industry, be approached with caution. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The effects of the Pd content (0-1 wt %) and the synthesis method (joint impregnation with Ni + Pd and Pd/Ni or Ni/Pd sequential impregnation) on the physicochemical and catalytic properties of Ni-Pd/CeZrO2/Al2O3 were studied in order to develop an efficient catalyst for the conversion of methane into hydrogen-containing gas. It was shown that variation in the palladium content and a change in the method used for the introduction of an active constituent into the support matrix make it possible to regulate the redox properties of nickel cations but do not affect the size of NiO particles (14.0 +/- 0.5 nm) and the phase composition of the catalyst ((gamma + delta)-Al2O3, CeZrO2 solid solution, and NiO). It was established that the activity of Ni-Pd catalysts in the reaction of autothermal methane reforming depends on the method of synthesis and increases in the following order: Ni + Pd < Ni/Pd < Pd/Ni. It was found that, as the Pd content of the Ni-Pd/CeZrO2/Al2O3 catalyst was decreased from 1 to 0.05 wt %, the ability for self-activation, high activity, and operational stability of the catalyst under the conditions of autothermal methane reforming remained unaffected: at 850 degrees C, the yield of hydrogen was similar to 70% at a methane conversion of similar to 100% during a 24-h reaction.

AB Herein, we investigated the effects of di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) on photosynthesis, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) content, oxidative damage, and biomass accumulation of different tissues in wheat (Triticum aestivum L) planted in cinnamon soils. The photosynthetic or fluorescence parameters (except for the intercellular carbon dioxide concentration), chlorophyll content, RuBisCO content, and biomass of roots, stems, and leaves decreased at the seedling, jointing, and booting stages under the stress of DBP. Compared with the control, the content of superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide in the roots, stems, and leaves increased with increasing DBP concentrations at the seedling, jointing, and booting stages. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the roots, stems, and leaves increased under the 10 and 20 mg kg(-1) DBP treatments; however, no significant changes were observed under the 40 mg kg(-1) DBP treatment at the seedling stage (except for the SOD activity in roots). The increase in SOD and CAT activities in the roots, stems, and leaves with increasing DBP concentration at the jointing and booting stages suggested that an increase in the activities of these antioxidant enzymes may play an important role in defending against excess reactive oxygen species under DBP stress. The biomass of wheat roots, stems, and leaves decreased with an increase in DBP concentration, which was presumably caused by a decrease in photosynthesis and RuBisCO. The effect of DBP on wheat roots, stems, and leaves decreased with wheat growth. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Multiple antiseptics have been described for use in total joint arthroplasty infection, and the use of multiple antiseptic solutions during a single operation has been described. Our clinical experience is that chlorhexidine (CHX) and Dakin's solution (NaOCl) interact and form a precipitate. The purpose of this study is to determine whether this reaction could be replicated in a laboratory setting, and to determine if other commonly used antiseptics also visibly react when mixed.
   Methods: Four percent chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX), 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and 10% povidone-iodine (BTD) solutions were obtained and all possible combinations were mixed. Any visible reactions were noted and recorded, and a literature search was performed to characterize the reaction and products.
   Results: CHX and NaOCl, CHX and H2O2, and CHX and BTD reacted instantly, forming a precipitate. NaOCl and H2O2 reacted to produce a gas. NaOCl and BTD reacted and produced a color change. The literature review revealed that at least 2 of the reactions tested (CHX thorn NaOCl and NaOCl thorn H2O2) could result in byproducts toxic to humans.
   Conclusion: Surgeons must be aware of these interactions when using antiseptic solutions during procedures. Caution should be used combining or mixing antiseptics, and we recommend against concomitant introduction in a surgical wound. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper aims at exploring the dynamic couplings of flame morphology and explosion pressure evolution experimentally and theoretically. In the experiment, flame morphology and explosion pressure evolution under diffusional-thermal and hydrodynamic instability are recorded using high-speed schlieren photography and pressure transducer. In the theoretical calculation, the effects of cellular flame on the explosion pressure evolution are conducted using smooth flame, D = 2.0566, 2.1 and 7/3. The results demonstrate that the cellular flame formation of various equivalence ratios could be attributed to the fact Lewis number is less than unity on the lean side. The flame destabilization of Phi = 0.8 and 3.0 with increasing initial pressure is due to the decreasing flame thickness regardless of unchangeable thermal expansion ratio. Much smaller cells formation on the cellular flame surface as the explosion pressure rises could be attributed to the joint effect of the diffusional-thermal and hydrodynamic instability. Note that the explosion pressure evolution in spherical chamber is obviously underestimated assuming the flame surface is smooth during the hydrogen/air explosion. But the explosion overpressure is overpredicted significantly with D = 7/3. The theoretical overpressure with D = 2.1 is in satisfactory agreement with experimental results.

AB Human carbonic anhydrase II (HCA II) uses a Zn-bound OH-/H2O mechanism to catalyze the reversible hydration of CO2. This catalysis also involves a separate proton transfer step, mediated by an ordered solvent network coordinated by hydrophilic residues. One of these residues, Tyr7, was previously shown to be deprotonated in the neutron crystal structure at pH 10. This observation indicated that Tyr7 has a perturbed pK(a) compared with free tyrosine. To further probe the pK(a) of this residue, NMR spectroscopic measurements of [C-13] Tyr-labeled holo HCA II (with active-site Zn present) were preformed to titrate all Tyr residues between pH 5.4-11.0. In addition, neutron studies of apo HCA II (with Zn removed from the active site) at pH 7.5 and holo HCA II at pH 6 were conducted. This detailed interrogation of tyrosines in HCA II by NMR and neutron crystallography revealed a significantly lowered pK(a) of Tyr7 and how pH and Tyr proximity to Zn affect hydrogen-bonding interactions.

AB In this study, we introduced a modified cathodic cage plasma deposition (CCPD) system to synthesize a Ti-Nb-C-N-based composite coating on AISI-4340 steel. This composite coating is widely applied in orthopedic joint implants due to its effective bioactivity and wear resistance. In the existing CCPD system, a metallic cathodic cage of a specific material is used to deposit the coating of such material. Thus, it cannot be used to deposit the coating of a composite material. Here, we inserted composite material rings (80% TiO2 + 10% Nb2O5 + 10% graphite) on the lid of the cathodic cage, where the cathodic cage holds these rings and works as a counter electrode for plasma generation. The composite coating is synthesized in nitrogen plasma at various temperatures (300-400 degrees C) and various hydrogen contents (20, 50, and 80%). It is observed that the hardness of AISI-4340 steel (280 HV0.25) can be increased up to 1430 HV0.25 for coating deposited at 400 degrees C and 50% hydrogen, which is 5 times higher than the untreated sample. The XRD pattern shows that composite coating consists of TiN, Ti2N, NbN, NbC, and TiO2. The contents of oxide phase TiO2 are reduced by adding hydrogen gas to the processing environment; thus, the nitride-based composite coating can be synthesized. The wear volume is significantly reduced by composite coating, specifically while using higher hydrogen contents and higher temperatures. This study shows that this modified CCPD system can improve the hardness and wear resistance by synthesizing this composite coating. In contrast with conventional techniques, separate metallic targets for each element in composite coating (titanium, niobium, and carbon targets) are not required, simple equipment, rough vacuum level are required, and high-processing efficiency are advantages of this system.

A novel method for thermodynamic calculation of steam gasification of iron makes it possible to predict the specific yield of hydrogen by 63% more than with coal gasification is developed. During experi-ments on Ekibastuz coal, it is obtained syngas with a ratio H2/CO = 6.0 which is 2-3 times higher than in traditional gasifiers. It is predicted that in the case of joint coal-iron gasification, a ratio of H2/CO will be higher. The melting unit produces combustible gas with a calorific value of 7.0 MJ/nm3 and allows coal-iron gasification in fuel-free mode. An assessment shows: with the maximum wholesale price of natural gas (NG) on the market at 0.062$/m3, and in equivalent characteristics in relation to the NG, the cost of syngas produced in the system will be 0.025$/m3, which is 2-3 times lower than the cost of NG in Kazakhstan.

AB Focusing on the self-assembly strategy of polymer chain structure, designing and synthesizing intelligent, tough and healable polymer materials is an effective way to meet the high-end applications of materials. Inspired by spider silk, we designed a preparation scheme for a repairable polyurethane-polyurea elastomer (IPAD-6.4) with an unprecedented mechanical toughness of 625.10 MJ/m(3) and elongation at break of 3756.56%. After repeated cyclic stretching, the elastic body can recover 92.85% of the dissipated energy in only 2 h. These results are achieved by the hierarchical hydrogen bonds formed by different groups and the reasonable covalent cross-linking network. Additionally, the elastomer shows excellent healing ability (repair efficiency similar to 102.77%). A flexible conductive composite film is prepared by simple physical assembly. The sensor can not only accurately detect the bending motion of human joints, but also has excellent antibacterial properties, which gives the material application potential in medical and engineering fields.

AB Magnesium hydride (MGH), a highly promising hydrogen-producing substance/additive for hydrogen production through its hydrolysis reaction, has the potential to enhance broiler production. However, before incorporating MGH as a hydrogen-producing additive in broiler feed, it is crucial to fully understand its impact on microbiota and metabolites. In vitro fermentation models provide a fast, reproducible, and direct assessment tool for microbiota metabolism and composition. This study aims to investigate the effects of MGH and coated-magnesium hydride (CMG) on fermentation characteristics, as well as the microbiota and metabolome in the culture of in vitro fermentation using cecal inocula from broilers. After 48 h of incubation, it was observed that the presence of MGH had a significant impact on various factors. Specifically, the content of N-NH3 decreased, while the total hydrogen gas and total SCFAs increased. Furthermore, the presence of MGH promoted the abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria such as Ruminococcus, Blautia, Coprobacillus, and Dysgonomonas. On the other hand, the presence of CMG led to an increase in the concentration of lactic acid, acetic acid, and valeric acid. Additionally, CMG affected the diversity of microbiota in the culture, resulting in an enrichment of the relative abundance of Firmicutes, as well as genera of Lactobacillus, Coprococcus, and Eubacterium. Conversely, the relative abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria and pathogenic bacteria Shigella decreased. Metabolome analysis revealed that MGH and CMG treatment caused significant changes in 21 co-regulated metabolites, primarily associated with lipid, amino acid, benzenoids, and organooxygen compounds. Importantly, joint correlation analysis revealed that MGH or CMG treatments had a direct impact on the microbiota, which in turn indirectly influenced metabolites in the culture. In summary, the results of this study suggested that both MGH and coated-MGH have similar yet distinct positive effects on the microbiota and metabolites of the broiler cecal in an in vitro fermentation model.

ID HYDROGEN
AB Experimental results which prove indirectly MHD effects at water electrolysis in an external constant magnetic field presumably due to electron emission from the cathode at the gas-electrolyte interface have been obtained. The joint conductive action of the constant magnetic field on the electric current in the electrolyte and on the flow of charged particles moving over the surface of hydrogen and oxygen bubbles under different orientation of the current I and magnetic field B vectors is also considered. The paper presents images of forces acting when applying a constant magnetic field to the electrolyte and gas bubbles during electrolysis, which explain the occurrence of convective gas-liquid flows. It is shown that by changing the parameters of electrolysis, topography and orientation of the electrodes, the strength and direction of the constant magnetic field it is possible to control forced convection of electrolyte. Such convection assists in enhancing the efficiency of the water electrolysis process.

AB A new brazing process for thin-walled stainless steel was proposed by combining green and efficient Ni-Cr-P electrodeposition with brazing technology. Novel information was attained by analyzing the electrodeposited Ni-Cr-P interlayers and the brazed joints and characterizing them using a combination of advanced techniques. The incorporation mechanisms of impurities (i.e., oxygen and carbon) in the Ni-Cr-P interlayers electrodeposited from a Cr(III)-glycine solution were revealed. The oxygen mainly came from the Cr(III)-hydroxy complexes formed by the hydrolysis and olation between Cr(III) complexes and OH- ions near the cathode. Glycine did not directly participate in the cathode reactions but decomposed on the anode surface. These byproducts (carbonyl compounds) were directly incorporated into the interlayers in a molecular pattern, forming a weak link to the metallic chromium. Brazing test results showed that a certain amount of Cr2O3 powder, formed by the decomposition of chromium hydroxides in the interlayers under high-temperature catalysis, would cause the degradation of the brazed joints. Using the step-wise brazing method, the brazing sheets were first annealed to eliminate the impurities by utilizing the strong reducing effect of hydrogen and the weak link characteristics between carbonyl compounds and metallic chromium atoms. An excellent joint with a shear strength of 63.0 MPa was obtained by subsequent brazing. The microstructural analysis showed that the brazed seam was mainly composed of a Ni-Fe-Cr solid solution, the Ni3P eutectic phase, and small quantities of the Ni5P2 phase scattered in the Ni3P eutectic phase. Fracture mode observations showed that the cracks extended along the interface between the brittle P-containing phase and the primary phase, resulting in fracture.

TI Attraction between Like Charged Ions in Ionic Liquids: Unveiling the
   Enigma of Tetracyanoborate Anions
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB Intermolecular interactions in ionic liquids are mainly governed by Coulombic forces. Attraction between cations has been previously observed and was attributed to dispersion interactions between nonpolar moieties, hydrogen bonding, or pi stacking. In this study, we present the intriguing behavior of tetracyanoborate anions in ionic liquids that, unlike their dicyanamide and tricyanomethanide counterparts, form dimers in both solid and liquid phases. A joint simulation and experimental study uncovers the origin of such anion-anion attraction: stabilization by induction and dispersion forces between several cyano groups, which is strong enough to overcome electrostatic repulsion. These findings open up new opportunities in the rational design of ionic liquids, where interactions between ions of the same charge can be controlled and fine-tuned by the presence of cyano groups.

TI Determining structural and chemical heterogeneities of surface species

SO SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The structure determination of surface species has long been a challenge because of their rich chemical heterogeneities. Modern tip-based microscopic techniques can resolve heterogeneities from their distinct electronic, geometric, and vibrational properties at the single-molecule level but with limited interpretation from each. Here, we combined scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), noncontact atomic force microscopy (AFM), and tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) to characterize an assumed inactive system, pentacene on the Ag(110) surface. This enabled us to unambiguously correlate the structural and chemical heterogeneities of three pentacene-derivative species through specific carbon-hydrogen bond breaking. The joint STM-AFM-TERS strategy provides a comprehensive solution for determining chemical structures that are widely present in surface catalysis, on-surface synthesis, and twodimensional materials.

TI Multiphoton Ionization Reduction of Atoms in Two-Color Femtosecond Laser

AB We report the ionization reduction of atoms in two-color femtosecond laser fields in this joint theoretical -experimental study. For the multiphoton ionization of atoms using a 400 nm laser pulse, the ionization probability is reduced if another relatively weak 800 nm laser pulse is overlapped. Such ionization reduction consistently occurs regardless of the relative phase between the two pulses. The time-dependent Schrodinger equation simulation results indicate that with the assisted 800 nm photons the electron can be launched to Rydberg states with large angular quantum numbers, which stand off the nuclei and thus are hard to be freed in the multiphoton regime. This mechanism works for hydrogen, helium, and probably some other atoms if two-color laser fields are properly tuned.

AB Pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) is a rare, dominant genetic disorder affecting bone and cartilage development, characterized by short-limb short stature, brachydactyly, loose joints, joint stiffness, and pain. The disorder is caused by mutations in the COMP gene, which encodes a protein that plays a role in the formation of collagen fibers. In this study, we present the clinical and genetic characteristics of PSACH in two Chinese families. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis revealed two novel missense variants in the COMP gene: NM_000095.3: c.1319G>T (p.G440V, maternal) and NM_000095.3: c.1304A>T (p.D435V, paternal-mosaic). Strikingly, both the G440V and D435V mutations were located in the same T3 repeat motif and exhibited the potential to form hydrogen bonds with each other. Upon further analysis using Missense3D and PyMOL, we ascertained that these mutations showed the propensity to disrupt the protein structure of COMP, thus hampering its functioning. Our findings expand the existing knowledge of the genetic etiology underlying PSACH. The identification of new variants in the COMP gene can broaden the range of mutations linked with the condition. This information can contribute to the diagnosis and genetic counseling of patients with PSACH.

AB In recent years, smart textiles and flexible wearable products have garnered significant attention in fields such as human-computer interaction, medical rehabilitation training, and motion monitoring. Flexible pressure sensors have attracted significant attention due to their excellent flexibility, stability, and multifunctional integration. Herein, a multifunctional wearable MXene/polydopamine (PDA)@cotton fabric pressure sensor was developed by modifying weft-knitted cotton fabric based on a dual hydrogen bond self-assembly strategy. The MXene/PDA@cotton fabric pressure sensor demonstrates wide linear detection range (0-146 kPa), high sensitivity (0.95 kPa-1), fast response/recovery times (16.434 and 11.952 ms), and outstanding stability after over 5000 cyclic tests. This sensor can achieve the monitoring of physiological parameters for human state detection, such as facial expression signals, abdominal respiratory signals, and joint bending signals. Furthermore, by integrating the MXene/PDA sensors into the interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints of a cotton glove, combined with intelligent algorithms and the human-computer interaction system, static gesture recognition and dynamic sign language translation were successfully realized based on the smart glove. This work demonstrates the potential application of flexible pressure sensors in intelligent human-computer interaction, providing new insights for developing next-generation sign language recognition systems.

AB The coexistence of glyphosate and copper is widely found in bodies of water and terrestrial ecosystems due to widespread application of herbicides and heavy metal. However, their joint ecotoxicological risks in aquatic environments remain unknown. The experiment investigated the individual and combined effects of glyphosate and copper on the growth and physiological response in Salvinia natans (L.) All. The results showed that their joint toxicity is related to concentration. Antagonistic effects were induced when plants were exposed to low concentrations of glyphosate and copper (<= 1 + 0.2 mg l(-1)). Synergistic effects were elicited at higher doses (>= 5 + 1 mg l(-1)). In addition, increased hydrogen peroxide levels indicated the occurrence of oxidative stress at individual or combined exposures. To cope with oxidative stress, S. natans can activate the antioxidant defense systems, including increased superoxide dismutase and changes in peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase and catalase. High concentrations of combined pollution exceed the oxidative defense capabilities of plants, and therefore, malondialdehyde content increased significantly. Our results indicated that the ecotoxicity of glyphosate or copper may be exacerbated in aquatic environments and caused obvious damage to S. natans. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report on a joint theoretical and experimental investigation into the electron-induced fragmentation of 2-chloroadenine, for electrons up to 12 eV. Elastic scattering calculations indicate an anion spectrum comprising a sigma(CCl)* and four pi* shape resonances, where the latter are systematically stabilised when compared to the analogue states of adenine. The measured ion yields indicate strong signals associated with the elimination of neutral hydrogen (peaking at 0.8 eV and with milder structures up to 2 eV), chloride ions and hydrochloric acid (both observed at around 0.2 and 0.9 eV). Bound state calculations indicate that the main feature for hydrogen abstraction arises from a vibrational Feshbach resonance on a dipole-bound state coupled to a sNH* state, while the pi(2)* and pi(3)* resonances initiate this fragmentation process in the 1-2 eV region. On the other hand, the C-Cl bond cleavage would mainly arise from the formation of the pi(1)* and pi(2)* resonances, which couple to the dissociative sigma(CCl)* state. Our results show that 2-chloroadenine efficiently dissociates into reactive species upon electron attachment, corroborating its potential as a radiosensitising drug.

TI The effect of four methods of surface activation for improved adhesion
   of wood polymer composites (WPCs)
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADHESION AND ADHESIVES
LA English
DT Article
DE Wood Plastic Composites; Lap shear; Surface treatment; Adhesion
AB Wood Polymer Composites (WPCs) have attracted a lot of interest in recent years as materials with a high renewable content. However the adhesion between WPC components is problematic because of low surface energy and the hydrophobic nature of the most widely used polymer matrices, i.e. polyolefins. Thus this paper has looked at four surface activation pretreatment methods to improve adhesion properties for bonding using epoxy adhesives, namely: hydrogen peroxide solution; hot air; a gas flame; and halogen heating lamps. The treatments were applied to WPC materials made from 60% wood flour in a polypropylene matrix, and lap joint shear strength was measured.
   Shear strength values showed that all treatments except the halogen heating lamps increased the bond strength and the best results were achieved with hydrogen peroxide treatment at a pH of 7.5 (37% improvement); a two pass hot air treatment at a pass speed of 75 mm s(-1) (44% improvement); and a gas flame treatment at a pass speed of 175 mm s(-1)(41% improvement).The bond strength was increased to values that caused failure within the material, rather than at the interfaces of the bond line.

TI Fatigue crack growth rates in high pressure hydrogen gas for multiple
   X100 pipeline welds accounting for crack location and residual stress
SO ENGINEERING FRACTURE MECHANICS

DE Hydrogen embrittlement; Residual stress; Welds; Heat affected zone;
   Fatigue crack growth rate
ID STEELS
AB Fatigue crack growth rates (FCGR) of multiple X100 pipeline steel welds and heat affected zones were measured in high-pressure hydrogen gas to investigate their behavior compared to lower strength pipeline welds. A total of five high strength welds and two heat affected zones (HAZ) were examined all of which were fabricated using the same X100 base material. Different welding wires and techniques were used to fabricate the welds to provide a variety of end products to evaluate susceptibility to fatigue in high pressure hydrogen gas. Residual stresses were measured for each weld and HAZ using the slitting method and the effect of residual stress on the stress intensity factor, K-res, was determined. Using K-res, the fatigue crack growth rate curves were corrected to remove the effects of residual stress by examining the influence of K-res on stress ratio, R. Comparisons were then made between the high strength welds, which were corrected for residual stress, and lower strength welds from the literature. It was found that the higher strength welds and heat affected zones exhibited comparable fatigue crack growth rates to lower strength welds, as the FCGR data of the high strength welds overlaid the lower strength welds. This suggests that despite distinct differences in strength and microstructure between the different welds, hydrogen-assisted fatigue crack growth susceptibility is similar. A comparison was made between the K-res measured in extracted coupons and residual stress estimates provided in relevant welded pipe assessment standards such as API 579-1/ASME FFS-1. It was found the residual stress values in the test coupons extracted from welded pipe were significantly lower than those expected in the intact welded pipes and highlights the importance in quantifying and removing coupon residual stresses when fatigue crack growth rates are measured and including expected weld joint residual stress when making structural assessments.

AB Significance: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a ubiquitous small gaseous signaling molecule, plays a critical role in various diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ischemic stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI) via reducing inflammation, inhibiting oxidative stress, and cell apoptosis. Recent Advances: Uncontrolled inflammation is closely related to pathological process of ischemic stroke, RA, MI, and IBD. Solid evidence has revealed the axes between gut and other organs like joint, brain, and heart, and indicated that H2S-mediated anti-inflammatory effect against IBD, RA, MI, and ischemic stroke might be related to regulating the functions of axes between gut and other organs.<br /> Critical Issues: We reviewed endogenous H2S biogenesis and the H2S-releasing donors, and revealed the anti-inflammatory effects of H2S in IBD, ischemic stroke, RA, and MI. Importantly, this review outlined the potential role of H2S in the gut-joint axis, gut-brain axis, and gut-heart axis as a gasotransmitter.<br /> Future Direction: The rate, location, and timing of H2S release from its donors determine its potential success or failure as a useful therapeutic agent and should be focused on in the future research. Therefore, there is still a need to explore internal and external sources monitoring and controlling H2S concentration. Moreover, more efficient H2S-releasing compounds are needed; a better understanding of their chemistry and properties should be further developed. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 00, 000-000.

AB Optical pumping of molecules provides unique opportunities for control of chemical reactions at a wide range of rotational energies. This work reports a chemical reaction with extreme rotational excitation of a reactant and its kinetic characterization. We investigate the chemical reactivity for the hydrogen abstraction reaction SiO+ + H-2 & RARR; SiOH+ + H in an ion trap. The SiO+ cations are prepared in a narrow rotational state distribution, including super-rotor states with rotational quantum number (j) as high as 170, using a broad-band optical pumping method. We show that the super-rotor states of SiO+ substantially enhance the reaction rate, a trend reproduced by complementary theoretical studies. We reveal the mechanism for the rotational enhancement of the reactivity to be a strong coupling of the SiO+ rotational mode with the reaction coordinate at the transition state on the dominant dynamical pathway.
   Control of chemical reactivity through excitation of rotational states is a relatively unexplored process that may play a role in interstellar chemistry. Here the authors show a marked acceleration of the hydrogen abstraction reaction between SiO+ and H-2 by exciting super-rotor states of SiO+, in a joint experimental and theoretical study.

AB Chemical reaction dynamics needs the joint effort from both experiment and theory, and theory is useful to rationalize the experimental results by offering intimate details of chemical reaction dynamics and to explore new reaction pathways. With the aid of machine learning, we develop here an accurate full-dimensional potential energy surface (PES) for the reaction between Cl + SiH4. This PES can describe well the hydrogen abstraction channel to HCl + SiH3. It can also give a good description for the hydrogen substitution channel to H + SiH3Cl, which is the focus of the current study and has never been reported by theory. The dynamics of this substitution channel is revealed in detail by calculating ample quasi-classical trajectories (QCTs) on the new PES. The computed product angular distributions are in good agreement with the only crossed molecular beam experiment. Both theory and experiment suggest that this channel takes place mainly via the typical S(N)2 inversion mechanism. Theory reveals that there also exists a novel torsion mechanism for the substitution channel. Two dynamic mechanisms are analyzed in detail. The present detailed theoretical dynamics study sheds insightful and novel understanding for this fundamentally important chemical reaction.

AB Apremilast (APR), an anti-psoriatic agent, easily forms isostructural cocrystals and solvates with aromatic entities, often disobeying at the same time Kitaigorodsky's rule as to the saturation of possible hydrogen-bonding sites. In this paper the reasons for this peculiar behavior are investigated, employing a joint experimental and theoretical approach. This includes the design of cocrystals with coformers having a high propensity towards the formation of both aromatic-aromatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions, determination of their structure, using solid-state NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, as well as calculations of stabilization energies of formation of the obtained cocrystals, followed by crystal structure prediction calculations and solubility measurements. The findings indicate that the stabilization energies of cocrystal formation are positive in all cases, which results from strain in the APR conformation in these crystal forms. On the other hand, solubility measurements show that the Gibbs free energy of formation of the apremilast:picolinamide cocrystal is negative, suggesting that the formation of the studied cocrystals is entropy driven. This entropic stabilization is associated with the disorder observed in almost all known cocrystals and solvates of APR.

AB Slag-discharge lock hopper is a critical equipment in the slag-water system of Coal gasification hydrogen production technology. To investigate the characteristics of liquid-solid two-phase flow and stress distribution during the discharging process of an intermittent slag-discharge system, this study established an experimental platform for slag-discharge lock hopper and conducted dynamic discharging experiments. The effects of flushing water flow rate, initial height of the material, and material particle size on the phenomena of liquid-solid twophase flow and stress distribution in the slag-discharge lock hopper discharging process were studied. The relationship among the material discharge rate, flow pattern transformation and wall normal stress during the discharging process of slag lock hopper is studied. Results indicate that as the flushing water flow rate increases, the average discharge rate increases, but the increase trend of discharge rate gradually slows down. Additionally, the normal stress on the wall of the cylinder-cone joint part fluctuates slightly, and the overpressure coefficient at the outlet part increases first and then decreases slowly. As the initial material height increases, the average discharge rate initially rises and then decreases, and the phenomenon of wall overpressure becomes more obvious. As the particle size of the material increases, the average discharge rate decreases, and the change in normal stress on the wall at the cylinder-cone joint part becomes more pronounced, manifesting in a heightened frequency of overpressure phenomenon.

AB Developing a high-performance electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) requires a comprehensive consideration of the three key factors, that is, intrinsic activity, electric conductivity, and active site number. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a self-supported Ni2P/WO2.83 heterointerface microsphere as a highly active and low-cost catalyst for alkaline HER, which has simultaneously addressed these key issues by a joint application of heterointerface construction and defect and architecture engineering strategies. Our density functional theory calculations revealed Ni2P and WO2.83 optimized by the interface coupling effect work in concert to improve the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. Importantly, the metalloid Ni2P in an intimate combination with the oxygen-defect-rich WO2.83 species endowed the electrocatalyst with high conductivity. Furthermore, the Ni2P/WO2.83 electrocatalyst presented a superhydrophilic nanostructure, ensuring abundant active sites and their accessibility. Benefiting from these attributes, the obtained Ni2P/WO2.83 heterointerface electrocatalyst exhibited excellent activity along with favorable stability for alkaline HER, especially at high current density, surpassing the most reported non-precious catalysts.

AB Alamethicin, a peptide consisted of 20 amino acid residues, has been known to function as an antibiotic. The peptides self-associate in biological membranes, form an ion channel, and then induce cell death by leaking intracellular contents through a transmembrane pore of an ion channel. We investigated conformation and its thermal stability of alamethicin-A6 and -U6 in ethanol using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy; alamethicin-A6 and -U6 have the amino acid sequences of UPUAUAQUVUGLUPVUUQQO and UPUAUUQUVUGLUPVUUQQO, respectively, where U and O represent alpha-aminoisobutyric acid and phenylalaninol, respectively. As indicated by the under bars in the sequences, only the residue 6 differs between the alamethicins. We show that the alamethicins in ethanol form helix conformation in the region of the residues 2-11 and a non-regular conformation in the regions of the N- and C-termini, and that the helices are maintained up to 66 degrees C at least. Conformations in the region of the residues 12-18 of the alamethicins, however, are not well identified due to the lack of NMR data. In addition, we demonstrate that the amide proton chemical shift temperature coefficients' method, which is known as an indicator for intramolecular hydrogen bonds in peptides and proteins in aqueous solutions, can be also applied to the alamethicins in ethanol. Further, we show that the conformation around the C-terminus of alamethicin-A6 is restrained by intramolecular hydrogen bonds, whereas that of alamethicin-U6 is either restrained or unrestrained by intramolecular hydrogen bonds; the alamethicin-U6 molecules having the restrained and unrestrained conformations coexist in ethanol. We discuss the two types of conformations using a model chain consisting of particles linked by rigid bonds called as the free jointed chain.

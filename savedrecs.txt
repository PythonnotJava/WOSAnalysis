AB A coordinated scheduling model based on two-stage distributionally robust optimization (TSDRO) is proposed for integrated energy systems (IESs) with electricity-hydrogen hybrid energy storage. The scheduling problem of the IES is divided into two stages in the TSDRO-based coordinated scheduling model. The first stage addresses the day-ahead optimal scheduling problem of the IES under deterministic forecasting information, while the second stage uses a distributionally robust optimization method to determine the intraday rescheduling problem under high-order uncertainties, building upon the results of the first stage. The scheduling model also considers collaboration among the electricity, thermal, and gas networks, focusing on economic operation and carbon emissions. The flexibility of these networks and the energy gradient utilization of hydrogen units during operation are also incorporated into the model. To improve computational efficiency, the nonlinear formulations in the TSDRO-based coordinated scheduling model are properly linearized to obtain a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model. The Column-Constraint Generation (C & CG) algorithm is then employed to decompose the scheduling model into a master problem and subproblems. Through the iterative solution of the master problem and subproblems, an efficient analysis of the coordinated scheduling model is achieved. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed TSDRO-based coordinated scheduling model is verified through case studies. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed TSDRO-based coordinated scheduling model can effectively accomplish the optimal scheduling task while considering the uncertainty and flexibility of the system. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed TSDRO-based coordinated scheduling model can better balance conservativeness and robustness.

AB To address the issues of energy wastage and uncertainty impacts associated with high levels of renewable energy integration, a multi-objective distributed robust low-carbon optimization scheduling strategy for hydrogen-integrated Integrated Energy Systems (IES) is proposed. This strategy incorporates a green hydrogen trading mechanism and low-carbon demand response. Firstly, to leverage the low-carbon and clean characteristics of hydrogen energy, an efficient hydrogen utilization model was constructed, consisting of electricity-based hydrogen production, waste heat recovery, multi-stage hydrogen use, hydrogen blending in gas, and hydrogen storage. This significantly enhanced the system's renewable energy consumption and carbon reduction. Secondly, to improve the consumption of green hydrogen, a novel reward-punishment green hydrogen certificate trading mechanism was proposed. The impact of green hydrogen trading prices on system operation was discussed, promoting the synergistic operation of green hydrogen and green electricity. Based on the traditional demand-response model, a novel low-carbon demand-response strategy is proposed, with carbon emission factors serving as guiding signals. Finally, considering the uncertainty of renewable energy, an innovative optimal trade-off multi-objective distributed robust model was proposed, which simultaneously considered low-carbon, economic, and robustness aspects. The model was solved using an improved adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm. Case study results show that, after introducing the reward-punishment green hydrogen trading mechanism and low-carbon demand response, the system's total cost was reduced by approximately 5.16% and 4.37%, and carbon emissions were reduced by approximately 7.84% and 6.72%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed multi-objective distributed robust model not only considers the system's economy, low-carbon, and robustness but also offers higher solving efficiency and optimization performance compared to multi-objective optimization methods.

AB At present, the number of electric vehicles is increasing day by day. The full integration of electric vehicles and multi-energy coupled integrated energy systems is the future development trend. This paper introduces a novel form of flexible energy storage in the integrated energy system ;(IES): electric vehicle (EV). And It proposes that mixed natural gas hydrogen be used as the primary energy source for IES, which replaces traditional natural gas. Combined with the above, the IES is scheduled to meet the system's multi-load for heating, cooling, and electricity demands. Based on the integrated energy system's structure and energy conversion principles, a robust two-stage optimization model for the IES is proposed to minimize the daily operation scheduling costs. The proposed model considers the uncertainty of distributed renewable generation and flexible energy storage. Uncertain adjustment parameters are introduced into the model, which can flexibly adjust the conservatism of the scheme. Using the column and constraint generation algorithm (C&CG) and the strong duality theory, the model presented in this paper is solved and the optimal scheduling scheme is obtained. The final simulation results validate the effectiveness of the model and algorithm. The addition of flexible energy storage and mixed natural gas hydrogen effectively improves the economy and flexibility of the system while reducing carbon emissions costs. Consideration of uncertainty improves system robustness and safety. In addition, sensitivity analyses of the influence of the proportion of hydrogen mixed with natural gas, the setting of uncertain adjustment parameters, electricity prices, weather, and load fluctuations on system operation. The results show that compared to existing research, electric vehicles as a flexible energy storage device and mixed natural gas hydrogen supply, increase the economic benefits of IES by 19.8% and 23%, respectively.

AB In recent years, with the natural problems such as the primary energy shortage and Greenhouse Effect becoming more and more serious, many countries have put forward Carbon-Neutral plans to gradually use the wind and light this kind of clean energy to generate electricity. First, this paper constructs a new renewable hybrid energy power system, which is composed of wind turbine (WT), photovoltaic (PV), electric energy storage, hydrogen energy storage, electrolytic cell and hydrogen gas turbine (HGT). Secondly, the scheduling strategy considering the demand response (DR) is studied. In the economic evaluation, according to the typical and extreme situations of new energy power generation caused by weather factors, three scenarios are constructed for research. In the simulation analysis part, the YALMIP solver is used to call CPLEX based on MATLAB platform to solve the objective, and the optimal solution in the scheduling cycle is obtained. The results show that the scheduling strategy proposed in this paper can save 22.8% of the operating cost under the same conditions. In the evaluation of renewable energy efficiency, a new scenario is constructed, and the result is still ideal.

AB The multi-energy system, encompassing electricity networks, district heating networks (DHNs), and hydrogen- enriched compressed natural gas (HCNG) networks, provides an alternative for enhancing operational flexibility. This paper investigates a data-driven two-stage scheduling strategy of multi-energy system to promote uncertain renewable energy integration and improve economic benefits. Dynamic models for DHNs and HCNG networks are established, and the flexibility of multi-energy system is quantified through distribution-level power aggregation. To compromise flexibility enhancement and operational cost reduction, the multiobjective day-ahead scheduling optimization is conducted based on adaptive batch-ParEGO method. Taking day-ahead scheduling as a baseline, a data-driven real-time dispatch method is proposed based on the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, which adaptively modifies the energy management scheme in smaller temporal dimension to address uncertainties on both the load and source sides. The performance of the proposed two-stage scheduling method is demonstrated through numerical tests.

ID NATURAL-GAS; NETWORKED MICROGRIDS
AB Multi-energy microgrids (MEMG) are becoming increasingly popular. However, most existing MEMG works are mainly focused on economic operations while ignoring the MEMG's potential to enhance power system resilience through emergency islanding from the maingrid during extreme events. To bridge this gap, a resilient scheduling strategy for electricity-gas-hydrogen MEMGs is proposed in this work considering emergency islanding constraints due to uncertain maingrid failure during extreme events. To efficiently deal with the emergency islanding uncertainty, a unified scheduling model that incorporates both normal and islanded operation constraints is proposed. The proposed unified scheduling model not only facilitates seamless switching between normal and resilient operation modes, but also enables controllable system preparedness under the resilient operation mode. To solve the formulated stochastic optimization model, an efficient distributed solution methodology is developed based on the progressive hedging (PH) algorithm. Further, an improved PH algorithm is proposed to accelerate the solution process. The superiority of the proposed methods is demonstrated in numerical experiments by reducing 0.45% of operational cost, 17.13% of computational time, and 91.05% of load loss even in the worst-case emergency islanding scenario.

AB Making full use of renewable energy to supply clean energy for transportation sector can effectively reduce environmental pollution and realize the sustainable development. A hybrid electricity/hydrogen/gas/refueling station (EHGRS) powered by renewable energy in an off-grid region is proposed. It supplies electricity for electric vehicles (EVs), and hydrogen for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) and produces natural gas for natural gas vehicles (NGVs) simultaneously. A hybrid stochastic/information gap decision theory (IGDT) optimization method is employed for the scheduling problem of the hybrid EHGRS in an uncertain environment. The un-certainties of wind and photovoltaic (PV) power is modelled via scenarios, while the uncertainties of the de-mands of EVs, HFCVs and NGVs, depending on human behavior, are formulated with a bi-level IGDT method without knowing the accurate distribution information. The work aims to find the maximum expected profits of the hybrid EHGRS. Two different scheduling strategies, i.e. risk-averse and risk-seeker, with two contradictory attitudes under the uncertain demands are proposed. Results indicate that 1) The proposed hybrid EHGRS can simultaneously provide different fuels to EVs, HFCVs and NGVs. 2) Under the same condition, the profit for the risk-averse scheduling is decreased and the risk-seeker scheduling is increased, compared to the results obtained by the pure stochastic optimization.

AB Hydrogen blended gas turbines (HBGTs) are pivotal for the carbon emission reduction (CER) of urban integrated energy systems (UIESs). However, the traditional rough modeling performed in the existing research on optimal scheduling is not suitable for the implementation of HBGTs. To reflect the influence of hydrogen blending on the operation performance of HBGTs, a novel HBGT model is developed in this study based on the multidisciplinary integration modeling methodology with chemical reaction kinetics and system thermodynamics. This model can describe carbon emission and co-combustion power generation properties of HBGT. When the tracking of hydrogen-enriched compressed natural gas (HCNG) composition is considered, the model can be further applied to the stochastic optimal scheduling of electricity-HCNG UIESs with internal and external uncertainties to solve the carbon emission and renewable energy source (RES) consumption problems of UIESs. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed HBGT modeling method has low-carbon economy and offers accurate operation performance. Furthermore, HBGT power generation can reduce the carbon emissions of an electricity-HCNG UIES by 22.62%. Meanwhile, the economy and wind power consumption are improved by more than 0.71% and 6.53%, respectively. The proposed optimal scheduling model considering multiple uncertainties is more reliable with the improvement of confidence level, which is an important guide for obtaining the optimal hydrogen blending ratio and promoting the CER of UIES.

The gas produced is stored and converted back to electricity at a later time; or it is directly used to supply a gas load and/or sell in the gas market. In the first case, due to double energy conversion in a relatively less efficient process, a large portion of the energy is wasted. The latter case is examined in this paper, where PtG storage is optimally scheduled to convert waste/inexpensive electricity to synthetic natural gas for some useful operations at appropriate time periods. To that end, a new model is proposed for optimal day-ahead scheduling of PtG storage and gas load management in electricity and gas markets to minimize the cost of gas consumption for the gas load. A gas demand forecasting algorithm is integrated into the scheduling model. Reserve provision is formulated as part of the optimization problem to optimally manage the gas load in case of an outage in the gas grid. The application of the proposed model to a test case is examined, and the results are studied.

AB With increasing hydrogen usage, hydrogen subsystem should be considered in the multi-energy chain and a model is required that assumes current energy infrastructures, while preserving independent energy subsystems. In this study, a stochastic agent-based model is introduced for the coordinated scheduling of multi-vector microgrids considering interactions between electricity, hydrogen, and gas agents. Power to hydrogen (P2H) through electrolysis, hydrogen to power (H2P) through fuel cells, hydrogen to gas (H2G) through methanation, and gas to power (G2P) through distributed generation (DG) units are modeled to present the interactions among energy agents. The interactions in terms of shared variables and coupling constraints are described using augmented Lagrangian relaxation (ALR) and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to obtain three correlated optimization problems, preserving the privacy of energy sectors with minimum data exchange. An iterative process is accomplished among energy sectors to reach a consensus. Uncertainties in the wind turbine (WT) and photovoltaic (PV) power output, hydrogen vehicles (HVs), demands, and prices are captured using a stochastic method. To evaluate the proposed method, case studies are conducted using a multi-energy microgrid. The results verify that the microgrid is well scheduled and the interactions are accurately modeled, representing the effectiveness of the proposed method.

ID POWER
AB With the development of the new power systems, the issue of wind and solar power curtailment is increasingly prominent. The production and utilization of hydrogen can support the energy system with high renewable energy penetration. Therefore, this paper incorporates hydrogen coupling into the traditional integrated electricity-gas energy system and formulates a day-ahead and intra-day optimal scheduling model. Firstly, instead of using a constant coefficient, a piecewise function is developed to simulate the dynamic hydrogen production characteristics of the electrolyzer. Secondly, a multi-energy complementary integration model is established. In the integrated energy system, hydrogen is injected into natural gas pipelines via the hydrogen mixing node to power the gas turbine, and a novel hydrogen energy utilization method bypassing the methanation process is proposed. Finally, the spectral risk theory is introduced to assess the risk losses caused by uncertainties in the integrated energy system, comprehensively balance the operating cost and risk exposure. Six comparative case studies are designed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling model considering the dynamic hydrogen doping strategy and spectrum risk theory. Simulation results demonstrate that the diversified hydrogen utilization framework and the spectral risk assessment method significantly enhance system economics and renewable energy consumption.

   energy system; temporal relevance; Improved aumann-shapley value method
AB Waste-to-energy (WTE) is a technology that converts inexhaustible waste into electricity, thus significantly alleviating energy crisis. Integrating hydrogen storage into WTE provides an effective way to store and utilize surplus electricity from WTE on-site (by producing hydrogen). Additionally, integrating power-to-gas (P2G) into WTE provides an effective way to reduce CO2 emission from WTE on-site (by producing natural gas). To this end, a novel waste-driven renewable energy system (WRES), which is consisted of WTE, hydrogen storage, and P2G, has been proposed. However, the uncertain waste supply and electrical load markedly interfere with WRES operation. Meanwhile, when WTE, hydrogen storage, and P2G belong to different agents, the collaborative benefit from WRES operation should be rationally allocated among agents for system sustainability. This paper endeavors to achieve WRES scheduling and collaborative benefit allocation for WTE, hydrogen storage, and P2G under uncertainties. Firstly, a temporal relevance based distributionally robust optimization model is proposed for WRES scheduling under uncertainties, in which the possible range of the joint distribution for uncertainties is depicted by data covariance matrices involved ambiguity set. Secondly, collaborative benefit is allocated according to WTE, hydrogen storage, and P2G contributions, in which Gauss-Legendre quadrature formula is integrated with Aumann-Shapley value method to reduce calculation complexity. Finally, simulation results show that 1) the proposed scheduling model guarantees the economic and stable operation of WRES under uncertainties. 2) after considering the temporal relevance, WRES operation benefit is 8.35 % higher, which indicates that the proposed scheduling model has superiority in decision conservatism by introducing temporal relevance to remove impractical distributions in ambiguity set. 3) the proposed allocation model rationally distributes the collaborative benefit according to contributions, and presents lower calculation complexity, e.g., the calculation time is 95.52 % lower than the Shapely value method. This paper provides policy insights to promote widespread application and sustainable operation of WRES.

AB To address the challenges of high carbon emissions, significant costs, and complex energy management in large offshore platforms, this paper aims to establish an Integrated Energy System (IES) model for comprehensive management of gas, hydrogen, electricity, heat, and cooling energy. The objective is to decrease carbon emissions while minimizing costs. This paper integrates a stepped carbon trading mechanism to enhance the IES model. The refined model, which includes the stepped carbon trading mechanism, is evaluated across three distinct scenarios. Results indicate that the stepped carbon trading mechanism reduces carbon emissions by 44.7 tons compared to the traditional carbon trading mechanism and lowers costs by approximately 18.2 %. This demonstrates that the introduction of stepped carbon trading aids in both carbon emission reduction and cost control for offshore platform IES. Additionally, the time-scale scheduling model reveals changes in the operational outputs of cogeneration units, refrigeration units, and boiler units before and after optimization. This underscores the importance of effective energy management models for the synergistic operation of gas, hydrogen, electricity, heat, and cooling energy flows, significantly contributing to carbon emission reduction and cost control in offshore IES. The study highlights the critical role of advanced energy management strategies in enhancing the sustainability and economic efficiency of energy systems in offshore platforms.

AB To achieve low-carbon economic operation of hydrogen-doped integrated energy systems while mitigating the stochastic impact of new energy outputs on the system, the coordinated operation mode of hydrogen-doped gas turbines and electrolyzers is focused on, as well as a hybrid energy storage scheme involving both hydrogen and heat storage and an optimized scheduling model for integrated energy systems encompassing electricity-hydrogen-heat-cooling conversions is established. A model predictive control strategy based on deep learning prediction and feedback is proposed, and the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed strategy are demonstrated using error penalty coefficients. Moreover, the introduction of hydrogen energy exchange and ladder carbon trading is shown to effectively guide the low-carbon economic operation of hydrogen-doped integrated energy systems across multiple typical scenarios. A sensitivity analysis is conducted based on this framework, revealing that increases in the hydrogen doping ratio of turbines and the carbon base price led to higher system operation costs but effectively reduce carbon emissions.

AB In order to improve the consumption of renewable energy and reduce the carbon emissions of integrated energy systems (IESs), this paper proposes an optimal operation strategy for an integrated energy system considering the coordination of electricity and hydrogen in the context of carbon trading. The strategy makes full use of the traditional power-to-gas hydrogen production process and establishes a coupling model comprising cogeneration and carbon capture equipment, an electrolytic cell, a methane reactor, and a hydrogen fuel cell. Taking a minimum daily operating cost and minimal carbon emissions from the system as objective functions, a mixed-integer nonlinear optimal scheduling model is established. This paper designs examples based on MATLAB R2021b and uses the GUROBI solver to solve them. The results show that compared with the traditional two-stage operation process, the optimization method can reduce the daily operation cost of an IES by 26.01% and its carbon emissions by 90.32%. The results show that the operation mode of electro-hydrogen synergy can significantly reduce the carbon emissions of the system and realize a two-way flow of electro-hydrogen energy. At the same time, the addition of carbon capture equipment and the realization of carbon recycling prove the scheduling strategy's ability to achieve a low-carbon economy of the scheduling strategy.

AB Hybrid energy systems, integrating renewable energies, offer a sustainable and low-carbon solution for energy- intensive data centers, addressing the challenges posed by the variability of renewable sources and computational demands. This study proposes a stochastic optimization model of combined energy and computation scheduling of hybrid system and data center, in which a multi-energy storage system of electricity, hydrogen, natural gas, and heat is integrated to increase the flexibility and reliability of system. A scenario generation method for both renewable energy sources and computation loads is developed to characterize their uncertainties, which includes scenario identification, scenario sampling, and scenario generation and clustering steps. An optimization model, considering different objectives of operation cost, penalty cost of renewable power curtailment, and stepped carbon trade cost, is constructed to obtain the best energy and computation task coordinated scheduling strategies. A case study confirms the effectiveness of the proposed strategy for coordinating energy and computation scheduling in data centers. It compares the impact of key variables such as storage configurations and operational objectives. The strategy achieves a 15.26% cost reduction and a 10.79% carbon emission decrease versus traditional methods. Accounting for carbon allowances further cuts emissions by 59.04 %, albeit at a 7.67 % higher cost.

AB Multi-microgrid (MMG) systems provide an effective way to convert renewable energy into other forms of energy for low-carbon utilization. However, the coupling of multi-energy and renewable energy brings a challenge to the stable operation and dispatch of the system. Therefore, an electricity-thermal-gas-hydrogen MMG complementary optimization model based on peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity-thermal synergy is proposed. The model focuses on the coupling and conversion of electricity, hydrogen, and thermal through a hydrogen energy storage system (HESS) combined with renewable energy, and incorporates integrated demand response (IDR) and ladder-type carbon trading mechanism (LCTM). Subsequently, based on the cooperative game and the alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM), a multi-energy synergistic and complementary optimal scheduling strategy is proposed, which increases the flexibility of multi-energy sharing. In addition, a revenue allocation optimization strategy that takes into account the fairness and renewable energy consumption rate is proposed to achieve the stability of the alliance system operation. Finally, the simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed model and strategy, realizing the complementary sharing of regional multi-energy, enabling the expansion of the boundaries of optimal energy allocation, further improving the low-carbon economic operation capability of MMG, and reducing the dependence of the system on the energy market.

AB The integrated electricity-heat-gas-hydrogen energy system with demand-side management offers a promising pathway for multi-energy complementarity, efficient utilization, and flexible operation. However, traditional model-based control methods heavily depend on accurate mathematical models, making it challenging to adapt to the complex and dynamic operation environments of multi-energy systems. This work proposes a data-driven optimal energy scheduling framework using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for the integrated electricityheat-gas-hydrogen energy system. Firstly, multiple demand-side flexible sources are incorporated to enhance the operation flexibility, including electricity/heating/gas demand response program and controllable hydrogen fuel cell vehicle charging. Secondly, the coordinated optimization is formulated as a Markov decision process. The twin delayed deep deterministic policy (TD3) algorithm is used to deal with the flexible operation control. Finally, the safety and imitation (SI) mechanisms are proposed to improve the training performance of DRL, which ensures constraint adherence and accelerates policy learning of agent. The results show that the proposed SI-TD3 shows the fastest convergence and achieves the highest cumulative reward compared with the other baseline algorithms, including deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), SI-DDPG, and TD3. The system operation performance using the SI-TD3 algorithm is better than those of the three baseline algorithms, with improvements of 40.1%, 31.5%, and 25.9%, respectively.

AB To cope with the growing penetration rate of renewable energy and to enhance the absorption capacity of wind power, this paper investigates the applications of an Integrated Energy System (IES), Hydrogen Compressed Natural Gas (HCNG), and power-to-hydrogen (P2H) devices within the IES. It employs power-to-gas and gas blending with hydrogen to construct an efficient electricity-gas-electricity energy flow loop, establishing a Natural Gas-Electricity Coupling System (NGECS) model. On this basis, a coordinated scheduling method for gas-electric coupling systems using gas blended with hydrogen is proposed. A carbon trading mechanism is introduced to constrain carbon emissions, further reducing the system's carbon footprint. Multiple scenarios are set up for a comparative analysis in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. This study also analyzes the impact of different hydrogen blending ratios and methods on the low-carbon and economic performance of IES.

AB The combined heat and power (CHP) plant is one of the emerging technologies of gas-fired units, which plays an important role in reducing environmental pollutants and delivering high energy efficiency. Moreover, the hydrogen energy storage (HES) system with extra power storage from wind turbine via power to hydrogen technology allows the injection of stored energy into the power grid by reverse hydrogen to power services, offsetting in this way the uncertainty of wind power. Consequently, simultaneous usage of CHP and HES units not only makes the maximum use of wind power distribution but also increases flexibility and reduces the operating costs of the entire network. Therefore, this paper proposes an interval optimization technique for managing the uncertainty of wind power generation in the integrated electricity and natural gas (NG) networks considering CHP-HES. Moreover, to enhance the flexibility of the NG network, a linearized Taylor series-based model is proposed for modelling linepack of gas pipelines in the proposed scheduling framework that is formulated mixed-integer linear programming and solved using the Cplex solver. The obtained results indicate that the simultaneous use of CHP-HES in the day-ahead scheduling reduces the operating cost and increases the flexibility of the whole network.

AB Transport decarbonization including railway electrification has become a global trend in tackling the climate change challenge due to the substantive green-house-gas emissions from the transport sector. However, within the context of the rapidly growing electricity demand due to railway decarbonization, the existing power supply infrastructures are often stretched beyond their rating capacity, thus slowing down the railway electrification pace. To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel railway microgrid solution to economically and efficiently cater for the growing electricity demands of the railway sector. The proposed railway microgrid uses the existing traction network, local renewable generations and local power grid as its energy sources to meet both the traction and non-traction loads in the electrified railway systems. It also employs hydrogen storage systems and aggregated electric vehicle (EV) fleets to support flexible energy scheduling. To address the uncertainty of renewable energy and implement efficient energy scheduling, machine learning tools and agents are introduced in formulating and solving the optimal scheduling problem, including bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and an improved twins-actor deep deterministic policy gradient (Twins- Actor DDPG) method. To reduce the overall computational complexity, a fast recursive algorithm (FRA) is adopted to streamline the machine learning agents. Case studies confirm that the proposed optimal microgrid operation can achieve up to 18.7% costs reduction for the daily operation of the railway power supply system while meeting the electricity demand, and FRA can achieve up to 78.6% agent size reduction and 93.1% computational cost savings.

AB This paper proposes an individual-based distributed parallel (IBDP) method for the operation optimization of integrated energy systems considering heterogeneous structure. The proposed IBDP method utilizes individual-based models (IBMs) to describe integrated energy systems. In this model, three basic modelling units are summarized, from which, a general three-level model of integrated energy systems is inherited. Utilizing IBMs, the high-dimensional integrated energy system model is decoupled into distributed heterogeneous individuals. The individuals are with local information inside to protect their information privacy and independent operation from the environment. Meanwhile, global information, which provides with environmental boundary conditions, can be obtained through individual interactions. To solve the IBMs of integrated energy systems efficiently, an Proximal Jacobian alternating direction multiplier algorithm (Proximal Jacobian ADMM) is adopted to implement the IBDP where the subproblems of individuals run in parallel. To verify the veracity and stability of the proposed method, the IBDP is applied to optimize the operation strategy of integrated energy systems in four different scales, and the results are compared with that obtained by centralized optimization method.

AB With the rapid development of industry, the research of energy storage technology and renewable energy continues to be hot, and the energy industry opens the era of diversification. Multi-energy complementary has become a new trend in sustainable energy development, leading the energy industry to a new energy system of deep integration and integration of multiple energy sources. This paper proposes a hybrid optimization algorithm that combines particle swarm algorithms and Hooke-Jeeves (HJ) with a comprehensive evaluation index as the optimization objective, aiming to improve the speed of solving the capacity optimization of integrated energy systems. The multi-energy system configuration optimization platform that covers the index system, optimization model, and system analysis module was established to systematically solve the integrated energy system optimization configuration problem, moreover provide an important reference for integrated energy system design and implementation. Besides, the influence of optimization algorithms on the configuration results was analyzed. Taking the combination of soil source heat pump system and combined cooling, heating and power system as an example, this study quantifies and compares the optimization results and solution speeds of the hybrid algorithm and the traditional single optimization calculation. It is shown that the hybrid optimization algorithm reduces the amount of iteration steps by approximately 31% compared with the particle swarm algorithm and by approximately 48% compared with the HJ algorithm. This significantly improves the speed of the optimization computation while ensuring the accuracy of the computation results. (c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Renewable energy based multi-energy supply microgrids not only can cover different types of demands (such as, electricity/heat/gas), but also can interconnect with different utility grid networks (electricity/heat/gas). When there are large numbers of grid-connected microgrids, how to operate these multiple microgrids in real-time is a problem. In this paper, day-ahead stochastic optimization scheduling and real-time sliding window model predictive control are used to control the operation of microgrids. In order to consider the influence of future prediction on the current optimal decision results, different prediction methods are adopted to predict the load demands and renewable energy output. For example, online learning Markov chain prediction, and support vector machine are used to predict the future values. As for comparison, robust prediction and bilevel optimization are adopted to describe the future prediction uncertainty. The real-time operation of microgrids aims to follow the day-ahead exchanged energy with utility grids, which can minimize the impact of the microgrid on the utility grids. The supply network is an IEEE30 + gas20+ heat14 network. The results show that: 1) when the sliding window number is smaller, the total operation cost is larger, but the calculation time is smaller, the trade-off between sliding window numbers and calculation time should be considered; 2) the accuracy of the prediction impacts the 2-norm error of the operation cost, when we decrease by "1" unit of 2-norm prediction error of the whole system, the 2-norm operation cost will decrease by "0.15" unit; 3) from the view of the post-event analysis (total operation cost), for the Markov chain prediction method, the relative error is about 0.32%, is better than the support vector machine method; 4) in the robust cases, the larger the conservative value, the higher the stored hydrogen energy. At last, the results of real-time sliding window model predictive control problem are influenced by the future prediction methods and the window numbers. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The integrated energy systems (IESs) that combine multiple heterogeneous energy systems such as power, natural gas, and district heating systems, are believed to have high potentials in future energy systems owing to their advantages in economy, energy efficiency, and promoting renewable energy consumption. The complicated hydraulic and thermal operating conditions of the district heating network (DHN) render the dispatch of IESs a nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problem that is computationally intractable. To address this problem, firstly, we propose a hydraulic-thermal cooperative optimization (HTCO) model for the operation of IESs. Secondly, the DHN model is reformulated by introducing auxiliary variables to reduce the complexity, based on which the HTCO model is converted into a nonconvex quadratically constrained programming (NCQCP). Thirdly, a second-order conic relaxation model is proposed for the NCQCP model, and a penalty model is introduced based on the convex-concave procedure to reduce the relaxation errors. Finally, an iterative algorithm with efficient stopping criteria is developed for the HTCO model to find a local optimum, in which low optimality gaps (similar to 5.3% for the small case and similar to 2.4% for the big case) are numerically observed. Case studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

AB To enhance multi-energy complementarity and foster a low carbon economy of energy resources, this paper proposes an innovative low-carbon operation optimization method for electric-thermal-gas regional integrated energy systems. To bolster the low-carbon operation capabilities of such systems, a coordinated operation framework is presented that integrates carbon capture devices, power to gas equipment, combined heat and power units, and a multi-energy storage system. To address the challenge of high-dimensional constraint imbalance in the optimization process, a novel low-carbon operation optimization method is then proposed. The new method is based on an adaptive single-objective continuous optimization spiking neural P system, specifically designed for this purpose. Furthermore, simulation models of four typical schemes are established and employed to test and analyze the economy and carbon environmental pollution degree of the proposed system model, as well as the performance of the operation optimization method. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed method not only considers the economic viability of the target integrated energy system, but also significantly improves the wind power utilization and carbon reduction capabilities.

AB Hydrogen is becoming an increasingly appealing energy carrier, as the costs of renewable energy generation and water electrolysis continue to decline. Developing scalable modeling and decision tools for the H-2 supply chain that fully capture the flexibility of various resources is essential to understanding the overall cost-competitiveness of H-2 use. Here, we develop a H-2 supply chain planning model that determines the least-cost mix of H-2 generation, storage, transmission, and compression facilities to meet H-2 demands and is coupled with power systems through electricity prices. We incorporate flexible scheduling for H-2 trucks and pipeline, allowing them to serve as both H-2 transmission and storage resources to shift H-2 demand/production across space and time. The proposed model provides a reasonable trade-off between modeling accuracy and computational time, with linear relaxations for truck inventory routing and H-2 production unit commitment. The case study results in the U.S. Northeast indicate that the proposed flexible scheduling of H-2 transmission and storage resources is critical not only to cost minimization but also to the choice of H-2 production pathways between electrolysis and natural gas based production. Trucks as mobile storage could make intermittent electrolytic H-2 production more competitive by providing extra spatiotemporal flexibility.

AB With the development in the field of energy and the growing demand for sustainable energy, gas-electric integrated energy systems are attracting attention as an emerging energy supply method. At the same time, with the deep application of information technology, the cyber-physical interactions of gas-electric integrated energy systems are increasingly enhanced. To this end, first, the reliability assessment indices of a gas-electric integrated energy system, which comprehensively considers the interactions between cyber-physical and different energy sources, are established in this paper to quantitatively assess the reliability level of the system under different fault and failure conditions. Second, to solve the reliability optimization problem, a comprehensive reliability enhancement optimization model is constructed in this paper, which targets the sum of the total penalties of the failure rate and average repair time modification. The impact of the cyber systems on the gas-electric integrated energy systems is transformed into a modification of the failure rate and the average repair time, and the model is solved by an adaptive Gaussian particle swarm optimization algorithm. Finally, the applicability and superiority of the adaptive Gaussian particle swarm optimization algorithm to the reliability optimization of the gas-electricity integrated energy system are verified by conducting simulation tests on the gas-electricity integrated energy system coupled with an 8-node distribution system and the 11-node natural gas system in Belgium. Furthermore, the effects of cyber systems and cyber-attacks on system reliability optimization are also analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and the rationality of the newly defined reliability indices.

AB Modern urban integrated energy systems are usually large in scale and consist of several subsystems located in different areas with various types of users. The design and operation optimization of multi-area integrated energy systems (IES) faces challenges in integrating user engagement, operational independence of subsystems, and the combination of long-term objectives and operation optimization. To solve these problems, the present study proposes a supply-demand coordinated optimization method for multi-area IES to balance the long-term overall objectives with the independence of participants such as users and subsystems. Increasing overall benefits and ensuring fairness can be achieved by using the proposed methods. In the case study, considering long-term objectives, the carbon emissions of the system operation are reduced by 9.43% compared to the case without the long-term objectives. Meanwhile, the results show an approximately 25% reduction in the total cost and a 65% reduction in carbon emission, compared to the baseline. Moreover, the cost of different users decreases by 13%-17% from the baseline at the optimal agreed price. This optimization method provides a holistic framework for the design and operation, supply-demand coordination, and pricing of transactions for multi-area IES involving long-term planning and construction with multiple interests.

AB The presence of multiple uncertainties in demand response and renewable energy generation significantly impeded the planning of integrated energy systems (IES). To address this challenge, a novel hybrid robust -interval optimization (HRIO) framework was proposed in this study to facilitate flexible and robust uncer-tainty planning while reducing IES operation costs. The framework integrated robust optimization and interval analysis to account for the uncertainties associated with renewable energy generation output and demand response. To model IES planning as a deterministic bi-objective optimization problem with investment operation cost and robustness as the optimization objectives, a constrained multi-objective transition algorithm was developed to solve the problem. Simulation results obtained from a typical IES planning case demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed HRIO method in effectively coordinating the relationship between the system's econ-omy, robustness, and operation reliability. This study provided a theoretical guideline for IES operators and exhibited significant potential for engineering applications.

AB In order to achieve carbon peak and neutrality goals, many low-carbon operations are implemented in ports. Integrated energy systems that consist of port electricity and cooling loads, wind and PV energy devices, energy storage, and clean fuels are considered as a future technology. In addition, ports are important hubs for the global economy and trade; logistics optimization is also part of their objective, and most port facilities have complex logistics. This article proposes an energy-logistics collaborative optimization method to fully tap the potential of port-integrated energy systems. A logistics-energy system model is established by deeply examining the operational characteristics of logistics systems and their corresponding energy consumption patterns, considering ships' operational statuses, quay crane distribution constraints, and power balances. To better represent the ship-energy-logistics optimization problem, a hybrid system modeling technique is employed. The case of Shanghai Port is studied; the results show that costs can be reduced by 3.27% compared to the traditional optimization method, and a sensitivity analysis demonstrates the robustness of the proposed method.

ID OPTIMAL DISPATCH
AB Integrated Energy Systems (IESs) are important vehicles for achieving energy conservation and emission reduction. However, operating an IES smoothly is difficult due to source-load fluctuations and the complexity of the multiple timescales of different energy flows. To tackle the challenges, this paper proposes a two-stage dual-loop optimization framework for IESs, where the two stages comprise the first stage: day-ahead cooperative optimization of source-storage-demand (DCOS), and the second stage: intraday dual-loop rolling optimization control (IDRO). In DCOS, energy storage, and integrated demand response models are established, and a carbon emission trading mechanism is introduced to achieve an economically low-carbon operating plan. In IDRO, an electric power rolling optimization model based on model predictive control is established in the inner loop, and a cooling and heating power output adjustment strategy based on user comfort event-trigger mechanism is developed in the outer loop. The proposed optimization strategy enables the coordinated operation of multiple energy flows across various time scales, effectively mitigating the imbalance between production and demand during intraday operations under source-load fluctuations scenario. In case studies, this strategy is applied to a typical IES, with simulations conducted to evaluate its performance during typical summer and winter seasons.

AB As the energy crisis and the greenhouse effect intensify, developing a sustainable and clean energy system is particularly important. How to increase the utilization of clean energy and reduce carbon emissions is a pressing issue. To this end, an integrated energy system (IES) framework incorporating multi-stage hydrogen utilization and concentrated solar power (CSP) has been developed. This study optimizes the scheduling of the IES using a ladder-type carbon trading method to optimize the output of each unit, thereby achieving low-carbon economic operation. The research investigates the conversion and utilization among multiple heterogeneous energy flows, including electricity, heat, gas, and hydrogen, with a focus on the integration of multi-stage hydrogen utilization and CSP heat supply, and the interconnections among different units. Four comparative cases are established to evaluate the proposed IES framework in reducing the totalcost, mitigating renewable energy curtailment, and lowering carbon emissions. The results show that the proposed IES framework presents optimal results, with a total cost reduction of 19.74% and a carbon emission reduction of 36.79 tons, no new energy waste, and high carbon benefits. The proposed IES framework facilitates flexible and efficient distribution of multiple energy types, meeting energy demands while enabling multi-energy complementarity and feasibility.

AB Integrated energy systems combine multiple energy sources to improve efficiency and reduce pollutant emissions. However, the diversity of energy types within integrated energy systems results in a more complex structure. Analyzing economic, environmental, and energy performance alone does not accurately reflect the comprehensive performance of the system. Describing the various types of resources input to the system uniformly and thus comprehensively assessing the structure and processes of the system pose significant challenges. Therefore, based on conventional emergy analysis methodology, the materials consumption and costs of pollutant emissions over the whole life cycle of the system are considered, and a multi-objective sustainability optimization model is proposed to search for the optimal configuration of the solar-based integrated energy system. Optimization results show that the sustainability optimization model proposed in this study achieves better emergy performance compared to the conventional sustainability optimization model, the emergy yield, emergy investment ratio, environmental loading ratio, emergy yield ratio, and emergy sustainability index of the integrated energy system for the proposed model are 1.54 x 1017 seJ/y, 0.011, 20.08, 90.31, and 4.50, respectively. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the emergy yield is significantly affected by capacity, whereas the emergy investment ratio and emergy sustainability index are more sensitive to costs. The multi-objective sustainability optimization model proposed in this study provides a new perspective for addressing the relationship between different resources within integrated energy system, and is expected to guide the design of energy supply systems.

AB To solve the problems of low utilization of biomass and uncertainty and intermittency of wind power (WP) in rural winter, an interval optimization model of a rural integrated energy system with biogas fermentation and electrolytic hydrogen production is constructed in this paper. Firstly, a biogas fermentation kinetic model and a biogas hydrogen blending model are developed. Secondly, the interval number is used to describe the uncertainty of WP, and an interval optimization scheduling model is developed to minimize daily operating cost. Finally, a rural integrated energy system in Northeast China is taken as an example, and a sensitivity analysis of electricity price, gas production, and biomass price is conducted. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy can significantly reduce the wind abandonment rate and improve the economy by 3.8-22.3% compared with conventional energy storage under optimal dispatch.

ID GREEN AMMONIA; STORAGE
AB Power-to-ammonia (P2A) technology presents an effective strategy for facilitating the low-carbon transition of integrated energy system (IES), effectively addressing the stochastic and intermittent nature of renewable energy generation. In response to the challenges posed by the increased penetration of renewable energy, this paper develops an optimization scheduling model of IES based on chance constraints within an electricity-hydrogen-ammonia coupled architecture. The model integrates P2A technology, hydrogen blending in gas turbine (GT) and gas boiler (GB), and coal-ammonia co-combustion, while further modeling the dynamic characteristics of the electrolyzer. To account for renewable energy uncertainties, the probability reserve is formulated using chance-constrained programming (CCP). The model is solved using the sequence operation theory, which converts the CCP into a deterministic equivalent model to balance the expected and stochastic outputs of renewable generation. Case studies on four scenarios demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a 5.82% reduction in carbon emissions and a renewable energy utilization rate of 98.3%, outperforming traditional scheduling approaches. Additionally, the optimal system performance is achieved when hydrogen blending ratios reach 16% for GT and 18% for GB. These results underscore the model's effectiveness in enhancing low-carbon operation, maximizing renewable energy utilization, and improving the economic efficiency of IES.

AB Fuel expenses constitute the largest part of the operating cost of a merchant ship. Integrated energy systems that cover all energy loads with low fuel consumption, while being economically feasible, are increasingly studied and installed. Due to the large variety of possible configurations, design specifications, and operating conditions that change with time, the application of optimization methods is imperative. Designing the system for nominal conditions only is not sufficient. Instead, intertemporal optimization needs to be performed that can be static or dynamic. In the present article, intertemporal static and dynamic optimization problems for the synthesis, design, and operation (SDO) of integrated ship energy systems are stated mathematically and the solution methods are presented, while case studies demonstrate the applicability of the methods and also reveal that the optimal solution may defer significantly from the solutions suggested with the usual practice. While in other works, the SDO optimization problems are usually solved by two- or three-level algorithms; single-level algorithms are developed and applied here, which tackle all three aspects (S, D, and O) concurrently. The methods can also be applied on land installations, e.g., power plants, cogenerations systems, etc., with proper modifications.

AB Volt-VAR optimization (VVO) has been investigated extensively in power systems. However, under the era of integrated energy systems (IES), the growing interdependencies between different energy systems complicate traditional VVO. This is further hardened by incurred gas quality problems due to the hydrogen injection in IES, produced by widely applied power-to-gas (P2G) facilitates that couple between power and gas systems. This paper develops a two-stage volt-VAR-pressure optimization (VVPO) model for PV-penetrated IES to manage the variation of system voltages while managing gas quality indices. In addition to the traditional voltage regulating devices, P2G facilities, which can mitigate fluctuating PV output via converting the surplus generation into hydrogen, are also used for voltage management. A two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) based on moment information is utilized to model PV uncertainty. A semidefinite programming model is formulated and finally solved by the constraint generation algorithm. A 33-bus-20-node IES is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed VVPO on voltage management, ensured gas quality with high economic efficiency. The proposed VVPO is applicable to injecting other green gases into gas systems while ensuring power quality and enable system operators to provide low-cost but high-quality multi-energy to customers.

AB Recently, integrated energy systems have become a new type of energy supply model. It is clear that integrated energy systems can improve energy efficiency and reduce costs. However, the use of a battery energy storage system (BESS) as a backup power source will affect the operating costs of a regional integrated energy system (RIES) in different situations. In this paper, a regional integrated energy system including wind turbines, photovoltaics, gas turbines and battery energy storage was introduced. In order to obtain the minimum operation cost, an operation optimization model was built. The schedule plans of each unit were optimized by a moth flame optimization (MFO) algorithm. Finally, three different scenarios were proposed for the simulation optimization. The simulation optimization results show that when the BESS is used as a backup power source, the operating cost of the system and the resulting pollutant emissions are less than the diesel generator (DG) set. Therefore, it is worthwhile to use BESS instead of DG as the backup power source in RIES.

AB The optimal operation of integrated energy systems is affected by the network structure and source configuration in planning process. With the rapid developments of renewable energies, the optimal size and location of sources under uncertainty conditions should be considered in the planning. A robust optimization based coordinated network and source planning method of integrated energy systems is proposed in this paper. The coordinated network and sources planning model of integrated energy systems determining both the locations and sizes of the sources simultaneously is established. For the newly increased power loads, the constraint of gas and power supply necessities for new loads is added in the model. Additionally, to deal with the uncertainties of renewable energies, the robust optimization algorithm is applied to solve the planning problem, in which the random distribution parameters are unnecessary. The planning method is applied on an integrated energy system composed by a 20-node natural gas pipeline network and IEEE 33-bus testing system under 4 uncertainty scenarios. The detailed optimal sizes of sources at every bus can be obtained, and the total costs of the proposed robust planning method are at least 20.73% lower than the deterministic method under the 4 scenarios and different robust parameters. The simulating results show that for the most conservative condition, the proposed robust optimization based planning method can decrease 0.87% of the total costs under uncertainty conditions compared with the deterministic method.

AB The influence of global warming on building performance necessitates its consideration during the design phase. The conventional approach of separately designing the buildings and energy systems may not yield the globally optimal solution. To address this issue, this study proposes a coordinated optimization design approach for buildings and regional integrated energy systems (RIES) under future climate conditions. Firstly, a future regional load prediction model based on a Random Forest algorithm optimized by the Grey Wolf Optimizer is established. Next, a bi-level optimization model is proposed, with the upper level optimizing the building envelope to minimize costs and carbon emissions, and the lower level determining the optimal configuration capacity and operating strategy of RIES for cost minimization. Multi-objective grey wolf optimizer and CPLXE are employed to address the problem. Finally, the proposed method is validated using a case study of an office area in Jinan. The results show that the method can reduce costs by 14.6 % and carbon emissions by 50.93 % compared to the prototype building area with independent production systems, highlighting the potential of synergistic design between buildings and RIES. In addition, different optimization results were obtained under typical meteorological year, shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) 245, and SSP585 climate scenarios, indicating the impact of future climate on building and RIES design. Therefore, it is necessary to consider climate change in future design work.

AB This study tackles the multi-objective robust coordinated operation optimization of multi-park integrated energy systems (MPIESs) with categorized demand response (DR), accounting for diverse load characteristics across different parks, energy interdependence, uncertainties in wind and solar energy, and the flexibility of demandside management. First, categorized DR models are developed for industrial, residential, and commercial parks to reduce system operating costs and carbon emissions. A coordinated operation optimization model incorporating categorized DR into MPIESs is then proposed. Second, a bi-level operation framework for MPIESs is introduced to address uncertainties in wind and solar energy. The first level manages day-ahead operations based on complete wind and solar forecasts for a 24-h cycle, utilizing a unified adaptive robust optimization (UARO) method to derive DR plans across parks. The second level addresses intra-day operations, leveraging the GUROBI solver to dynamically adjust electricity transactions between parks and optimize the operation of energy conversion devices in response to hourly fluctuations in wind and solar energy. Finally, a case study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed categorized DR models and bi-level operation framework, benchmarking their performance against alternative operational approaches.

AB The use of renewable energy sources has energized the process of carbon neutrality, and in particular wind and hydrogen are being considered. However, each of them has its relative technical challenges, such as intermittency and uncertainty in the case of wind energy, and safety and economics in the case of hydrogen energy, which limits development. Expect to achieve optimal dispatch of the electric-hydrogen-thermal uncertainty of the two wind turbine co-generations in the two sets of parks. First, to measure the uncertainty of co-generation wind farms, a geometrical optimal Copula is selected for the two sets of wind turbine outputs, and a typical scenario is generated. Secondly, based on the uncertainty scenario establishment, by in hydrogen utilization, the scheduling situation is presented on a typical day economy under the carbon trading mechanism. The results show that the system by integrating the hydrogen energy industry chain, realizes the interaction with external carbon energy sources, adequately accommodates wind power generation, and the system operates economically under multiple uncertainty conditions. For the wind energy uncertainty study, the t-Copula function performs well on the Spearman side with-0.4923, and on the Kendall side with-0.3406. The placement of energy equipment is related to the impact of cost characteristics, and the microgrids can be selected to remove economically inefficient equipment through the scheduling assessment, when the low-utilization equipment is removed, the new scheduling strategy obtained shows that the cost of purchased electricity and gas is reduced, with a reduction of $65.94 and $34.12 in daily operating costs, respectively.

AB Integrated energy system as a welcome multiple-energy system has significant contribution to alleviate the worldwide energy shortage problem. In this paper, the theoretical model of integrated energy system was initially built. Also, a new self-adaption strategy relying on exhaustive search method is proposed for minimal hourly-operation-cost. On the basis, an optimization scheme oriented by minimal annualized system cost is presented for integrated energy system. Based on a case study, the optimal nominal capacity of devices and operation parameters are determined by the optimization scheme, respectively for isolated and connected scenarios with different operation strategies. In isolated scenario, the annualized system cost with self-adaption strategy is the lowest, around $23.60/m(2) for commercial building and around $19.39/m(2) for office building. In connected scenario, the minimal annualized system cost is $693.3 k (about $19.26/m(2)). Moreover, the applicability of building-scale and district-scale integrated energy systems in economy is compared. Finally, a collaborative optimization method that combines genetic algorithm and orthogonal experimental design is introduced to determine multiple decision variables for district-scale integrated energy system. The results show that the district-scale integrated energy system determined by collaborative optimization reduces the annualized cost by 0.67% (about $78.8 k), compared by non-collaborative optimization. These findings could provide the reference about integrated energy system optimization and further explore the development potential of multiple energy system. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Along with the popularity of distributed energy generations and hybrid energy appliances, the optimization of integrated energy system combining various kinds of energy has drawn more and more attention. In this paper, we establish a hierarchical model of integrated energy system, which composes of fundamental units such as energy converters, supply networks, and consumers. The fundamental units are modeled as individuals which operate independently and interact with others through mutual information. The fundamental units constitute low-level systems and the combinations of low-level systems make up high-level systems. In order to protect the information privacy of each individual and make full use of the limited mutual information, a decentralized optimization method is presented to optimize the operation strategy of the hierarchical system considering competitive activities between individuals. The individuals participate in an iterative process, interacting with others through an energy pricing mechanism until the system equilibrium achieved. Simulation studies are conducted on several integrated energy systems to investigate the performance of the proposed hierarchical model and decentralized optimization of coordinated electrical and thermal generations. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to a practical case of Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center, and the daily operation strategy of the energy supplier is optimized. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB As an energy system that uses the power grid and heat network to coordinate the energy interaction between subsystems in the region, the regional integrated energy system can further reduce the system's operating cost and improve the energy utilization rate. However, in the optimization of regional integrated energy systems, there is difficulty in balancing the accuracy of the results and the calculation time. Therefore, a nonlinear collaborative optimization model of a regional integrated energy system is established in this paper, which fully considers the electricity and heat sharing between energy stations. Subsequently, a three-layer-nested co-opti-mization method for a regional integrated energy system is proposed. The outer layer, middle layer, and inner layer optimize the rated capacity of the internal combustion engine, electric refrigeration ratio, and partial load rate of the internal combustion engine, respectively. Finally, the three-layer-nested co-optimization method is verified from the total system cost, energy utilization rate, and calculation time. The results show that compared with the exhaustive search method and genetic algorithm, the cost per unit area of the system is about 102.99 yen /m2 (reduced by 1.00 yen /m2), the energy utilization rate is 70.47% (increased by 2.43%), and the calculation time is about 50-100 h. The three-layer-nested co-optimization method significantly shortens the model's so-lution time while ensuring the optimization results' accuracy. Finally, this paper can provide a research idea for optimizing regional integrated energy system design.

AB Day-ahead scheduling optimisation plays a significant role in solving stable operation problems of district integrated energy systems (DIESs) by carrying out scheduling optimisation of key equipment of the system based on forecasting data. However, the stable operation of DIESs is affected by multiple uncertainties from sourceload. Day-ahead scheduling optimisation method is designed in this study for DIESs based on "prediction-optimisation" to reduce the impact of source-load uncertainty on the stable operation of system. Considering multidimensional source-load data, hybrid probability forecasting model based on Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN)-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-Gaussian Process Quantile Regression (GPQR) is introduced to quantify the uncertainty using prediction interval. K-means method is used to generate typical scenarios in optimisation step and these scenarios are fed into stochastic optimisation to obtain day-ahead scheduling optimisation results. The experimental results in case study show that hybrid probability prediction model exhibits good prediction performance, while the day-ahead scheduling optimisation based on stochastic optimisation for system's key equipment has the smallest error in typical summer and winter days compared with the real situation, which is 0.018 and 0.0176, respectively. The "prediction-optimisation" approach proposed in this paper shows significant advantages for improving the performance of day-ahead scheduling optimisation of DIESs.

AB Existing open-source modeling frameworks dedicated to energy systems optimization typically utilize (mixed-integer) linear programming ((MI)LP) formulations, which lack granularity for technical system design and operation. We present COMANDO, an open-source Python package for c omponent-o riented m odeling and optimiz a tion for n onlinear d esign and o peration of integrated energy systems. COMANDO allows to assemble system models from component models including nonlinear, dynamic and discrete characteristics. Based on a single system model, different deterministic and stochastic problem formulations can be obtained by varying objective function and underlying data, and by applying automatic or manual reformulations. The flexible open-source implementation allows for the integration of customized routines required to solve challenging problems, e.g., initialization, problem decomposition, or sequential solution strategies. We demonstrate features of COMANDO via case studies, including automated linearization, dynamic optimization, stochastic programming, and the use of nonlinear artificial neural networks (ANNs) as surrogate models in a reduced-space formulation for deterministic global optimization.

AB Integrated energy systems (IESs) can uniformly coordinate different locations and diversified forms of energy systems, which is critical for ensuring low-carbon and sustainable energy usage. This paper proposed a capacity and operation joint optimization method for an IES with multiple interconnected energy hubs (EHs) based on the Nash bargaining game. Firstly, considering the uncertainty of the EH, robust optimization was carried out for both long-term capacity planning and short-term operational strategies at the same stage. Furthermore, the optimization of the single EH is embedded in the cooperative framework of the IES, and it is formulated as an asymmetrical Nash bargaining game model, in which the players bargain over the transaction energy. Finally, this game model is solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm. Case studies with a typical IES including three EHs are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods. It was found that the proposed joint optimization method has better computational ability than traditional two-stage method. The asymmetrical bargaining solution can not only effectively reduce the cost of the IES, but also help achieve a fair benefit balance among EHs.

AB For a regional integrated energy system (RIES) composed of an energy supply network and distributed energy station, the uncertainty of distributed photovoltaic (PV) output and the fluctuation of various loads pose significant challenges to the stability of system operation and the accuracy of optimal scheduling. In order to enhance the operational reliability of regional integrated energy systems and reduce the impact of photovoltaic and load uncertainties on distributed energy stations, this study proposes robust optimization method of regional integrated energy systems that takes into account the uncertainty of the distributed energy station. First, the regional integrated energy system is divided into an upper electric-gas energy supply network and a lower distributed energy station. The upper model mainly realizes energy transmission, while the lower model is a two-stage robust optimization model of distributed energy stations in the form of min-max-min, which mainly realizes flexible energy supply of different types of energy. Then, the lower two-stage robust optimization model is simplified and solved using a column and constraint generation (CCG) algorithm. After that, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is used to solve the upper and lower models of the regional integrated energy system, and the solution scale is reduced while ensuring the correlation between the energy transmission network and the distributed energy stations. Finally, a test example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed method. It follows from simulation results that the robust optimization method can effectively reduce the instability of the system operation caused by uncertainty factors and improve the system's anti-interference ability, and in addition, systems with high penetration levels of photovoltaic output will benefit more from robust optimization.

AB Nowadays, to address the different demands of consumers, i.e., electricity, heat and gas, the concept of energy hub (EH) is emerged. Integrating multiple energy sources under the concept of energy hub can improve the efficiency and reliability of the system; moreover, efficiency increasing cause to decrease in environmental emission. Environmental emission is a very important issue from the global warming point of view that should be considered in the researches. In this regard, green hydrogen can be used as a clean energy carrier that can be stored for a long time without degradation. To this end, this paper focuses on the concept of hydrogen-based smart micro energy hub (SMEH) considering integrated demand response (IDR) and fuel cell-based hydrogen storage system (HSS). IDR is introduced to control consumers' electrical and heat demand patterns. Additionally, HSS not only can convert power from renewable energy sources (RESs) to hydrogen (P2H) in a low electricity price period and vice versa (H2P) in a high electricity price period but also can supply the hydrogen-based industry. The aim of the proposed model is to minimize the total energy cost of hydrogen-based energy hub integrated with IDR and HSS under a robust optimization (RO) approach considering the uncertainty of electricity price. The proposed optimization model provides day-ahead scheduling for SMEH, which would improve the operation of the energy system. Finally, simulation and numerical results are provided to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model. According to the obtained results, considered technologies cause to decrease in operation cost up to 7.8% and improve the system robustness against electricity market uncertainty up to 30%.

AB Economic and environmental benefits are the most important in the operation of community integrated energy systems (CIES), modeled as a bi-objective optimization problem. In the case of the uncertainties from loads and renewable energy generators, the effectiveness of the operation strategies may be degraded in the practical applications of CIES. In this paper, an improved triangle splitting based bi-objective optimization method is proposed to search for the Pareto optimal solution of the CIES operation. The general preference of decision-makers in practical applications is utilized in the search process to reduce the detailed search interval and consequently improve the optimization efficiency. In addition, a bi-objective uncertain optimization framework is established for the economic-environmental operation of the CIES under uncertainties. The correlation between uncertainties is considered to generate the operation scenarios, in which the solution probability function is employed to determine the final operation strategy with robustness. A comprehensive case study is conducted based on a practical CIES in China, proving the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methods.

AB This paper proposes a multi-individual distributed (MID) method for operation optimization of heterogeneous integrated energy systems. The proposed method decouples high-dimensional centralized problem of complex systems into distributed subproblems corresponding with independent small individuals. Each subproblem can be solved by appropriate algorithm according to its physical properties. In the MID method, the individuals carry out their own optimal operation strategies to maximize self-interests while information privacy and independent operation of system participants are protected. Furthermore, optimal energy market clearing prices, which guarantee the maximization of social welfare, are obtained in this method. When market transaction prices deviate from the optimal prices, there will be a marked decline in the benefit of the whole system.

AB Integrated Energy Systems (IESs) interconnect various energy networks to achieve coordinated planning and optimized operation among heterogeneous energy subsystems, making them a hot topic in current energy research. However, with the high integration of renewable energy sources, their fluctuation characteristics introduce uncertainties to the entire system, including the corresponding indirect carbon emissions from electricity. To address these issues, this paper constructs a two-stage, three-layer robust optimization operation model for IESs from day-ahead to intra-day. The model analyzes the uncertainties in carbon emission intensity at grid-connected nodes, as well as the uncertainty characteristics of photovoltaic, wind turbine, and cooling, heating, and electricity loads, expressed using polyhedral uncertainty sets. It standardizes the modeling of internal equipment in the IES, introduces carbon emission trading mechanisms, and constructs a low-carbon economic model, transforming the objective function and constraints into a compact form. The column-and-constraint generation algorithm is applied to transform the three-layer model into a single-layer main problem and a two-layer subproblem for iterative solution. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition is used to convert the two-layer subproblem into a linear programming model. A case study conducted on a park shows that while the introduction of uncertainty optimization increases system costs and carbon emissions compared to deterministic optimization, the scheduling strategy is more stable, significantly reducing the impact of uncertainties on the system. Moreover, the proposed strategy reduces total costs by 5.03% and carbon emissions by 1.25% compared to scenarios considering only source load uncertainty, fully verifying that the proposed method improves the economic and low-carbon performance of the system.

AB In the context of CO2 emissions reduction from power plants, CO2 removal from flue gas by chemical absorption with monoethanolamine is analyzed in detail. By applying process integration and multiobjective optimization techniques the influence of the operating conditions on the thermo- economic performance and on the optimal thermal integration within a power plant is studied. With the aim of performing optimization of complex integrated energy systems, simpler parameterized models of the CO2 capture process are developed. These models predict the optimized thermo- economic performances with regard to the capture rate, flue gas flowrate and CO2 concentration. When applied to overall process optimization, the optimization time is considerably reduced without penalizing the overall power plant model quality. This approach is promising for the preliminary design and evaluation of process options including a CO2 capture unit. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To address the challenge of grasping carbon emission costs in different dispatching cycles under multiple time scales of the Integrated Energy System (IES), a carbon-constrained multi-time scale optimization method for integrated energy systems is proposed. First, a novel mechanism was proposed, Carbon Constraint Mechanism, which includes carbon tax, green certificate trading, and tiered carbon trading mechanism. Second, the carbon constraint mechanism was introduced into multi time scale scheduling optimization, and an IES multi time scale low-carbon optimization scheduling model was established. Third, the economic cost, carbon emissions, and primary energy consumption were considered as objective functions in multi-objective optimal scheduling. Moreover, utilized day ahead scheduling results and real-time load forecasting to dynamically adjust the output power of IES equipment in combination with power change penalties and carbon constraints. The simulation results showed that, compared to dispatch optimization strategies that solely prioritized economy, this study reduced carbon emissions by 28.38 % across multiple time scales while enhancing the economic performance of IES by considering carbon constraints. The multi-time scale dispatch optimization, incorporating carbon constraint mechanisms, improved the system's stability and low-carbon economy, proving the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed optimal dispatch strategy.

AB In the context of "dual carbon", restrictions on carbon emissions have attracted widespread attention from researchers. In order to solve the issue of the insufficient exploration of the synergistic emission reduction effects of various low-carbon policies and technologies applied to multiple microgrids, we propose a multi-microgrid electricity cooperation optimization scheduling strategy based on stepped carbon trading, a hydrogen-doped natural gas system and P2G-CCS coupled operation. Firstly, a multi-energy microgrid model is developed, coupled with hydrogen-doped natural gas system and P2G-CCS, and then carbon trading and a carbon emission restriction mechanism are introduced. Based on this, a model for multi-microgrid electricity cooperation is established. Secondly, design optimization strategies for solving the model are divided into the day-ahead stage and the intraday stage. In the day-ahead stage, an improved alternating direction multiplier method is used to distribute the model to minimize the cooperative costs of multiple microgrids. In the intraday stage, based on the day-ahead scheduling results, an intraday scheduling model is established and a rolling optimization strategy to adjust the output of microgrid equipment and energy purchases is adopted, which reduces the impact of uncertainties in new energy output and load forecasting and improves the economic and low-carbon operation of multiple microgrids. Setting up different scenarios for experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the introduced low-carbon policies and technologies as well as the effectiveness of their synergistic interaction.

AB As the economy thrives, individual requirements for a comfortable living environment are increasing. The demand for thermal comfort is particularly high in winter. To improve the thermal comfort of households in a costeffective manner, a well-designed household energy consumption strategy that considers the multienergy coupling relationship within households needs to be proposed. Nevertheless, studies on optimal operational strategies for household integrated energy systems (HIES) to enhance environmental thermal comfort remain limited. Therefore, this paper proposes a scheduling strategy for HIESs to improve thermal comfort at a low cost. The predicted mean vote (PMV) index is introduced as a guiding metric to enhance the flexibility of system scheduling and maximize the integration of renewable energy sources to offset the energy surge associated with improved thermal conditions. Under time-of-use electricity and gas pricing, a multiobjective optimal scheduling model for integrated household electricity and heating systems was established for minimizing energy purchase costs and optimizing thermal comfort. This model was solved using the particle swarm optimization algorithm. Finally, simulations were conducted to explore the influence of varying the weights (G values) of the thermal comfort objectives on the system costs, environmental thermal comfort, and local consumption of photovoltaic energy. For HIESs, these simulations provide users with diverse scheduling solutions that effectively enhance the thermal comfort and local consumption of photovoltaic energy at a relatively low cost. The proposed static weight optimization strategy improves the environmental thermal comfort by 13.38 % and the local photovoltaic consumption by 22.10 %, with a 2 % increase in cost. Furthermore, a dynamic weight optimization strategy is proposed to better satisfy user demands. This strategy increased the thermal comfort and system's photovoltaic local consumption by 31.88 % and 53.86 %, respectively, with a 6.96 % increase in cost. Specifically, daytime thermal comfort increased by 53.82 %. Compared with the results of the static weight optimization strategy at the same cost, the all-day thermal comfort and the local photovoltaic consumption of the system under the dynamic weight optimization strategy increased by 0.56 % and 4.95 %, respectively, whereas the daytime thermal comfort was significantly enhanced by 23.01 %.

AB The application of integrated energy systems is significant for realizing the comprehensive utilization of various energy sources and improving the utilization rate of renewable energy. At present, the optimal operation of integrated energy systems is a research hotspot. However, shortcomings remain in the stochastic optimization operation and the scenario generation method. This paper proposes a stochastic optimization operation model of an integrated energy microgrid based on an advanced multi-scenario generation method. First, this paper establishes the time-divided probability distribution model of the forecasting error of the uncertain factors, such as photovoltaic (PV) power and load, which provide the basis for generating scenarios. Moreover, the covariance matrix is used to calculate the time correlation of the time-divided probabilistic distributed models, and the parameters of the covariance matrix are optimized. Second, based on multiple typical scenarios, the stochastic optimization operation model of the integrated energy microgrid is established. Finally, the real data is used to verify the proposed method. The results show that the nonparametric kernel density estimation method has the best fitting effect. On this basis, the time correlation and the operation costs are compared with the scenario sets generated by other methods, which proves the advantages of the proposed multi-scenario generation method and stochastic optimization operation model.

ID STRATEGY; MODEL
AB With the increasing global attention on energy efficiency and carbon emissions, the optimization of integrated energy systems (IES) has become the key to improve energy efficiency and reduce pollution emissions. However, most of the existing optimization methods cannot effectively deal with the complexity of high dimensional continuous action space. Therefore, this paper focuses on a novel multi-objective optimization strategy for the electricity-gas-heat integrated energy systems (EGH-IES). Firstly, considering the absorption capacity of wind power and the emission of pollutant gases, a multi-objective optimization model is constructed based on the mechanism model and operation constraints of each device in EGH-IES, in which the integrated operation cost and the environmental factors are taken as optimization objectives. Then, the multi-objective optimization problem is designed as the optimal strategy of interaction learning between agent and environment in reinforcement learning, and the output power of the devices constitutes the action of reinforcement learning. Additionally, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is introduced to enhance the training efficiency and exploration performance of the agent, and the deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPG) algorithm is employed to optimize the action, thus the output power of the appliances could be obtained. Finally, the simulation results show that compared with deep Q network (DQN) method and proximal policy optimization (PPO) method, the reward function value of the proposed method increases by 2.43% and 6.09%, respectively, which represents a reduction in economic cost and pollutant emissions. These verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed multi-objective optimization scheme in cost reduction and benefit improvement for the EGH-IES.

AB The inherent intermittency and variability of renewable energy sources present significant challenges to the optimal design and implementation of integrated energy systems (IES). This paper introduces a novel stochastic optimization model that integrates advanced scenario generation and clustering algorithm for renewable energy sources within a multi-objective, bi-level optimization framework. Specifically, the clearness index is employed to represent the stochastic distribution of solar radiation intensity by beta distribution, while wind speed uncertainty is modeled seasonally using the Weibull distribution. Monte Carlo sampling with synchronous back substitution is applied for scenario generation and reduction of solar radiation and wind speed. To address the multi-objective evaluation, the analytic hierarchy process is utilized, and the joint optimization is achieved by combining a region contraction algorithm with stochastic programming. The proposed methodology is validated on an IES featuring various heating devices, incorporating uncertainties in both wind and solar energy. The results indicate that the absorption heat pump-based scheme achieves superior energy-saving performance, achieving an energy rate of 0.4724. Additionally, the compression heat pump-based scheme exhibits excellent economic efficiency and environmental sustainability, with a cost of energy of 0.3639 and a renewable fraction of 0.5536.

AB This paper proposes a comprehensive framework including a multi-objective interval optimization model and evidential reasoning (ER) approach to solve the unit sizing problem of small-scale integrated energy systems, with uncertain wind and solar energies integrated. In the multi-objective interval optimization model, interval variables are introduced to tackle the uncertainties of the optimization problem. Aiming at simultaneously considering the cost and risk of a business investment, the average and deviation of life cycle cost (LCC) of the integrated energy system are formulated. In order to solve the problem, a novel multi-objective optimization algorithm, MGSOACC (multi-objective group search optimizer with adaptive covariance matrix and chaotic search), is developed, employing adaptive covariance matrix to make the search strategy adaptive and applying chaotic search to maintain the diversity of group. Furthermore, ER approach is applied to deal with multiple interests of an investor at the business decision making stage and to determine the final unit sizing solution, from the Pareto-optimal solutions. This paper reports on the simulation results obtained using a small-scale direct district heating system (DH) and a small-scale district heating and cooling system (DHC) optimized by the proposed framework. The results demonstrate the superiority of the multi-objective interval optimization model and ER approach in taclding the unit sizing problem of integrated energy systems considering the integration of uncertian wind and solar energies.

AB Biogas-solar-wind integrated energy systems are effective for optimizing rural energy consumption and improving agricultural production. The performance of an integrated energy system generally depends on its capacity configuration. However, the uncertainties of renewable energy sources and loads deepen the coupling relationship between the capacity configuration and energy dispatching of integrated energy systems, which makes optimizing the capacity difficult. We propose a two-stage robust optimization model for the capacity configuration of a biogas-solar-wind integrated energy system that is applicable to rural areas. First, a framework of the biogas-solar-wind integrated energy system was designed and diverse evaluation indices were introduced. Then, the integrated energy system model was transformed into a two-stage robust optimization problem, where the column-and-constraint generation algorithm is used to solve the installed capacity problem of the system equipment in the first stage, and the nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm is used to optimize the energy dispatching schedule in the second stage. Finally, the proposed model was applied to a rural area in China to confirm the rationality and effectiveness of the optimization results.

AB Future electricity generation systems must be optimized to provide flexibility that counteracts the variability of non-dispatchable renewable energy sources and ensures the reliability and safety of critical infrastructure, including the electric grid. The current state-of-the-art is to co-optimize the design and operation of integrated energy systems (IES) treating historical or predicted time-series electricity prices as fixed parameters. Recent literature has shown the limitations of this price taker assumption, which neglects how IES optimization decisions influence market outcomes. As such, this paper proposes a new optimization formulation that uses machine learning surrogate models, trained from a library of annual market operation simulations, to embed IES market interactions into the co-optimization problem directly. Using a thermal generator example built in the open-source IDAES computational environment, we show that the price taker approach routinely over predicts annual revenues by 8% or more compared to a validation simulation, where the proposed approach has a typical relative error of 1% or less.

AB Optimal design and control are often coupled tasks for improving energy system performances. There is a lack of study on the structure and control co-optimization of heat pump coupled with thermal energy storages, which can enhance the penetration levels of intermittent renewables in integrated energy systems, thus we proposed a coupled dynamic optimization method for the structure and control cooptimization of this kind of dynamic energy system, and applied it successfully to a transcritical CO2 ejector expansion heat pump coupled with hot and cold water storages for thermal energy charging. Based on a complicated nonlinear dynamic system model considering thermal stratification in thermal energy storages, the structure and control co-optimization solutions were obtained for this coupled system during energy charging by using the co-optimization method with genetic algorithm. The detailed structures of gas cooler, evaporator, hot and cold energy storage tanks were optimized, then a dynamic optimal control strategy was developed for the whole charging process. The overall coefficient of performance can be increased by 23.2% and the total power consumption can be reduced by 17.6% using this newly developed co-optimization strategy, compared to the constant control parameter strategy. This study would be helpful for a structure and control co-optimization of other dynamic or stable energy systems. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This manuscript develops a workflow, driven by data analytics algorithms, to support the optimization of the economic performance of an Integrated Energy System. The goal is to determine the optimum mix of capacities from a set of different energy producers (e.g., nuclear, gas, wind and solar). A stochastic-based optimizer is employed, based on Gaussian Process Modeling, which requires numerous samples for its training. Each sample represents a time series describing the demand, load, or other operational and economic profiles for various types of energy producers. These samples are synthetically generated using a reduced order modeling algorithm that reads a limited set of historical data, such as demand and load data from past years. Numerous data analysis methods are employed to construct the reduced order models, including, for example, the Auto Regressive Moving Average, Fourier series decomposition, and the peak detection algorithm. All these algorithms are designed to detrend the data and extract features that can be employed to generate synthetic time histories that preserve the statistical properties of the original limited historical data. The optimization cost function is based on an economic model that assesses the effective cost of energy based on two figures of merit: the specific cash flow stream for each energy producer and the total Net Present Value. An initial guess for the optimal capacities is obtained using the screening curve method. The results of the Gaussian Process model-based optimization are assessed using an exhaustive Monte Carlo search, with the results indicating reasonable optimization results. The workflow has been implemented inside the Idaho National Laboratory's Risk Analysis and Virtual Environment (RAVEN) framework. The main contribution of this study addresses several challenges in the current optimization methods of the energy portfolios in IES: First, the feasibility of generating the synthetic time series of the periodic peak data; Second, the computational burden of the conventional stochastic optimization of the energy portfolio, associated with the need for repeated executions of system models; Third, the inadequacies of previous studies in terms of the comparisons of the impact of the economic parameters. The proposed workflow can provide a scientifically defendable strategy to support decision-making in the electricity market and to help energy distributors develop a better understanding of the performance of integrated energy systems.

ID ALKALINE WATER ELECTROLYSIS; POWER
AB This paper proposed an optimized day-ahead generation model involving hydrogen-load demand-side response, with an aim to make the operation of an integrated wind-photovoltaic-energy storage hydrogen production system more cost-efficient. Considering the time-of-use electricity pricing plan, demand for hydrogen load, and the intermittency of renewable energy, the model has the ambition to achieve minimum daily cost of operating a hydrogen production system. The model is power-balanced, fit for energy storage devices, and developed through adaptive simulated annealing particle swarm optimization. Analysis results showed that the proposed optimized scheduling model helped avoid the significant purchase of electric power at peak times and reduced the cost of running the hydrogen production system, ensuring that the daily hydrogen energy produced could meet the daily demand for the gas load. This justified how the model and its algorithm were correctly and efficiently applied.

AB When optimizing the design of integrated energy systems, their energy demands are usually assumed as given input. However, the demand of energy systems may not always be available information or it can be uncertain, particularly for projects at the planning stage. Moreover, the overall energy demand is dependent on the behavior of many individuals, which might change as a result of technical, economic or policy interventions. Therefore, this study proposes a holistic approach to combine the demand modeling with design and dispatch optimization for integrated energy systems. The approach can be decomposed into two stages. Firstly, at demand simulation stage, Agent Based Modeling is adopted to generate uncertain demand scenarios for a case study community and the energy-consuming activities for various types of households living in different kinds of apartments are simulated based on probability models and demographic information. Dozens of demand scenarios are obtained via iterative simulation, and k-means clustering approach is further applied to generate representative stochastic scenarios. Secondly, at system optimization stage, the uncertain demand scenarios are used as input of an established stochastic Mixed Integer Linear Programming model, by which the system design and dispatch strategy can be optimized simultaneously. The case study shows that the obtained optimal solutions can save 36% of annual total cost compared to the business-as-usual baseline scenario.

AB The coordinated optimization scheduling of the integrated energy systems is vital in multi-energy complementarity and hierarchical utilization. However, the centralized optimization is inferior to the distributed optimization of the large-scale multiregion integrated energy system (MRIES) in data processing capacity and information security. This study proposes a distributed computing architecture based on the edge computing unit (ECU), which takes the energy hub as the main body and sets the partitioning principle and method of MRIES. The ECU can finally realize the whole-system collaborative optimization of MRIES, which contains electrical, natural gas, and district heating networks through internal autonomous optimization and boundary information interaction with the cloud computing center. At the same time, an improved nested algorithm based on the consensus-alternating direction method of multipliers is proposed, which ensures the convergence of the mixed-integer linear program and effectively improves the convergence speed. Combining the advantages of the model and algorithm provides a theoretical and algorithmic support for the optimization research of the MRIES.

AB By combining renewable energy systems (RESs) with buildings, building integrated energy systems (BIESs) reshape the building demand-supply relationship and contribute to both embodied and operational benefits. Their optimal designs, however, require consideration of various parameters and model complexity, making it challenging to solve multi-criteria problems and computationally intensive. This study aims to develop a datadriven two-phase optimization framework for exploring optimal BIES configurations. The novelties lie in 1) a co-simulation modelling and evaluation framework for BIES from both building and RES perspectives; 2) a twophase workflow to decouple the complex BIES model and solve multi-criteria decision problems and 3) an artificial neural network (ANN) surrogate model for rapid prediction. The proposed method is demonstrated using a prototype office building in a hot-summer and cold-winter area of China. The results show that RES-only optimization presents the lowest performances, necessitating the coordinated design for both building and RES sides. The simultaneous optimization method demonstrates the balanced quality for exploring both Pareto front and optimal solution, but encounters expensive computational costs (225 h) and convergence difficulty under 5000 optimization iterations. Comparatively, the proposed ANN-based two-phase optimization can achieve competitive solutions with half the computational time (90.6 h), which can be further reduced by efficient sampling methods. Overall, this study provides an optimization framework for holistically assessing and designing BIES that can approximate optimal configurations with significant computational savings.

ID OPTIMAL ENERGY MANAGEMENT
AB Power systems are susceptible to disruptions caused by natural disasters, leading to significant financial losses for distribution companies. The versatility of multi-carrier microgrids (MCMGs) in meeting the needs of various carriers, such as electricity and heat, has garnered considerable interest. The focus of this paper is on how transactive multi-carrier microgrids (TMCM) contribute to improving the resilience of energy systems during prolonged outages. A bi-level proactive day-ahead scheduling model of TMCMs is introduced herein that not only achieves optimal normal operation cost, but also ensures the maximum demand serving of power, heat, gas and hydrogen carriers during outages. The base interruptible program (BIP) ensures a successful and economically efficient way to ride through outage conditions, serving as an emergency demand response resource for the TMCM. Furthermore, each MCMG has its designated 24-hour marginal price that enables the power transaction among the MCMGs at both the normal and outage condition. The bi-level model is converted into a single-level scheduling model by applying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition. This approach utilizes a two-stage reformulation method to handle the integer variables. The simulation reveals that the need to sell power from MCMG 1 during the outage period has led to the supply of electricity in the market for six hours during peak time. Despite the only-power operation mode in five hours of the possible outage period, due to the high thermal load of microgrid 1, one of the CHP units is dispatched to produce 50-100 kW in cogeneration mode at 11:00-13:00.

AB With the rapid growth of penetration of distributed generations and the strong interdependencies of multiple energy sources, the optimal operation of integrated energy systems (IESs) is becoming more important than ever before. However, current optimal operation strategies for IESs may be impractical because their potential negative impacts on utility grids are generally not considered. Therefore, in this study, an original multiobjective optimization model for IES operation is formulated to minimize the operational cost, primary energy consumption, and carbon dioxide emission of IESs and to optimally reduce the power loss and voltage magnitude deviation of the utility grid. Then, a novel Pareto optimization algorithm, called multiobjective strength firefly algorithm (MOSFA), is proposed to solve the multiobjective operation problem of IES. The strength firefly algorithm (SFA) uses a Boltzmann distribution and a chaotic-sequence-based population selection process to facilitate local exploitation and global exploration. In addition, a generalized piecewise normal boundary intersection (GPNBI) method is developed to transform the multiobjective operation problem into a series of highly constrained single-objective optimization sub-problems that can be effectively solved by the SFA. Finally, a hyper-plane-based decision making strategy is introduced to identify the best compromise solution for the obtained Pareto frontiers. The GPNBI-inspired MOSFA was comprehensively evaluated on a novel IES powered by natural gas, wind and photovoltaic generators. The standard IEEE 39-bus system is considered as the utility grid. The numerical results demonstrated that the proposed MOSFA exhibits competitive performance when compared to the algorithms of the state, which means that the optimized operation strategy provides a better trade-off between all objectives considered in this study.

AB The uncertainty of renewable energy output randomness and multiple load demand uncertainty significantly increases the complexity of optimization and scheduling in regional integrated energy systems (RIES), rendering traditional optimization methods insufficient. This paper proposes a multi-scale optimization and scheduling strategy for RIES based on source-load forecasting. Firstly, considering the coupling characteristics of sources and loads, we construct a Multi-Task Multi-Head-based Source-Load Joint Forecasting Model (MTMH-MTL), which provides effective predictive data for optimization and scheduling. Secondly, to further mitigate the impacts of source and load randomness, we develop a multi-time scale optimization model, which plans unit output in two stages, namely, day-ahead and intra-day, through a rolling mechanism. Finally, case simulations confirm that the proposed approach flexibly reduces the influence of randomness on system operations. Compared to traditional methods, our approach reduces economic indicators by 9.17%, environmental indicators by 5.66%, significantly enhances RIES energy utilization, ensures dynamic user demand fulfillment, and strengthens energy stability.

AB Within the framework of "dual carbon", intending to enhance the use of green energies and minimize the emissions of carbon from energy systems, this study suggests a cost-effective low-carbon scheduling model that accounts for stepwise carbon trading for an integrated electricity, heat, gas, cooling, and hydrogen energy system. Firstly, given the clean and low-carbon attributes of hydrogen energy, a refined two-step operational framework for electricity-to-gas conversion is proposed. Building upon this foundation, a hydrogen fuel cell is integrated to formulate a multi-energy complementary coupling network. Second, a phased carbon trading approach is established to further explore the mechanism's carbon footprint potential. And then, an environmentally conscious and economically viable power dispatch model is developed to minimize total operating costs while maintaining ecological sustainability. This objective optimization framework is effectively implemented and solved using the CPLEX solver. Through a comparative analysis involving multiple case studies, the findings demonstrate that integrating electric-hydrogen coupling with phased carbon trading effectively enhances wind and solar energy utilization rates. This approach concurrently reduces the system's carbon emissions by 34.4% and lowers operating costs by 58.6%.

ID COMMITMENT; MODEL
AB The uncertainties of wind turbine (WT) output have large impacts on the optimal operation of integrated energy systems. This paper investigates the two-stage robust optimization (RO) of hybrid energy integration regarding wind volatility. In RO method, the WT output is modeled with an uncertainty budget, which represents the degree of conservatism. Simulation results validate that when the uncertainty budget rises to a maximal value, ESS degradation cost increases 25.7%, and total cost decreases 2.0%. Additionally, demand response program (DRP) exhibits elastic and voluntary merits. With the implementation of DRP, 6139.9$ total savings are achieved compared with the ordinary RO method. Meanwhile, the merits of stochastic optimization (SO) have also been studied. Despite the ESS degradation cost and total cost in SO being lower than those in RO, SO requires accurate probability distribution of uncertain variables in real situations. RO can shortly provide worst-case schemes which are highly appreciated by power utility companies. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Energy generation and its utilization is bound to increase in the following years resulting in accelerating depletion of fossil fuels, and consequently, undeniable damages to our environment. Over the past decade, despite significant efforts in renewable energy realization and developments for electricity generation, carbon dioxide emissions have been increasing rapidly. This is due to the fact that there is a need to go beyond the power sector and target energy generation in an integrated manner. In this regard, energy systems integration is a concept that looks into how different energy systems, or forms, can connect together in order to provide value for consumers and producers. Cogeneration and trigeneration are the two most well established technologies that are capable of producing two or three different forms of energy simultaneously within a single system. Integrated energy systems make for a very strong proposition since it results in energy saving, fuel diversification, and supply of cleaner energy. Optimization of such systems can be carried out using several techniques with regards to different objective functions. In this study, a variety of optimization methods that provides the possibility of performance improvements, with or without presence of constraints, are demonstrated, pinpointing the characteristics of each method along with detailed statistical reports. In this context, optimization techniques are classified into two primary groups including unconstrained optimization and constrained optimization techniques. Further, the potential applications of evolutionary computing in optimization of Integrated Energy Systems (IESs), particularly Combined Heat and Power (CHP) and Combined Cooling, Heating, and Power (CCHP), utilizing renewable energy sources are grasped and reviewed thoroughly. It was illustrated that the employment of classical optimization methods is fading out, replacing with evolutionary computing techniques. Amongst modern heuristic algorithms, each method has contributed more to a certain application; while the Genetic Algorithm (GA) was favored for thermoeconomic optimization, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was mostly applied for economic improvements. Given the mathematical nature and constraint satisfaction property of Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), this method is gaining prominence for scheduling applications in energy systems.

AB To fully explore the environmental benefits of integrated energy system (IES) and balance the interests of all parties involved in Demand Response (DR), a bi-level optimization model and a Stackelberg Game framework are proposed for multi-integrated energy systems (MIES) based on shared energy storage (SES). First, a bi-level optimization model for MIES is designed. The upper level optimizes economy, energy cost, and carbon emissions using the Non-dominated Sorting Whale Optimization Algorithm (NSWOA), while the lower level employs the Gurobi solver to ensure the balance between energy supply and demand within a typical day. Second, a Stackelberg Game framework is constructed to constrain the user behavior of DR and ensure orderly load changes. Moreover, an improved Nash bargaining algorithm with a comprehensive contribution factor, which is to quantify the contributions of each IES, is proposed to achieve reasonable profit distribution within the MIES. Simulation comparison shows that the proposed approach reduces costs and energy cost by 14.461 % and 22.925 %, respectively, which validate largely the model's effectiveness.

AB The exploitation of renewable energy sources is crucial in promoting energy transition from fossil-based to renewable-based, but their intermittent nature causes the mismatch of energy supply and demand. This can be resolved using an energy storage to store the excess energy from renewables and release it when the energy supply is in deficit. Hydrogen has a good potential for energy storage as it can tackle the spatial differences in renewable energy supply, but its storage in compressed gas or cryogenic liquid form incurs high investment cost. Liquid organic hydrogen carrier offers a cheaper and more convenient way of storing hydrogen as compared to conventional means. This paper proposes a cascade analysis approach for the targeting and scheduling of a self-sufficient standalone energy system that is fully supported by renewables and with liquid organic hydrogen carrier as energy storage. The fraction of hydrogen and electricity consumed for the system self-requirement is first determined before cascade analysis is performed to identify the optimal capacity of the energy system. Results indicated that 255,020 m(2) of solar panel is required for a region with 45.1 MWh daily electricity demand. If the system energy requirement is neglected, most equipment would be undersized by about 40%. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The capacity optimization of integrated energy systems (IESs) is directly related to economy and stability, while centralized optimization methods are difficult to solve for scenarios in which energy units belong to different operators. This study proposes a game theory-based multi-agent capacity optimization method for an IES to analyze the benefit interactions among independent operators in decision-making processes. The IES is composed of four plants: solar photovoltaic, wind turbine, combined heating and power system, and compressed air energy storage (CAES), wherein plant operators act as players, and the net present value (NPV) is selected as the utility function. The Nash equilibrium is proven to exist and is solved by the best response algorithm for analyzing self-interested optimization. The Shapley value method is adopted to deal with benefit allocation in cooperative coalition, considering both stability and fairness. Several case studies are conducted to analyze all fifteen possible game models among four players. The results show that the access of CAES could improve the environmental and economic performance of the IES. The completely cooperative game model yields better economic performance for the whole and for individuals; its total NPV is 20.15% higher than when individuals act alone.

AB Aiming at the uncertainty and complexity of multi-energy load forecasting in integrated energy systems, this study proposes a hybrid Quantile Regression (QR) model based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)-Time Step Attention. In the feature engineering phase, this model uses a method that combines Mutual Information and LightGBM for comprehensive variable analysis and feature screening to maximize the reduction of redundant features and avoid the omission of key feature variables. In the forecasting model, to address the problem of wide forecast ranges due to increased uncertainty at inflection points, an improved Quantile Regression Loss function is utilized to constrain the forecast intervals through a penalty mechanism, which narrows the forecast range while ensuring coverages. Furthermore, bayesian optimization is utilized to independently optimize the hyperparameters of the cold, heat, and electricity load respectively to match different load characteristics and improve the model training efficiency. The experimental results show that under the precondition of ensuring that the model forecast interval coverage is 100 %, when the Prediction Interval Nominal Confidence is 90 % and 95 %, the load prediction Average Interval Score of this model was reduced by an average of 36.74 %-51.48 % and 44.14 %-55.24 %, respectively.

Therefore, an adaptive clustering-based hierarchical layout optimisation method is proposed for a large-scale integrated energy system, considering energy balance, transmission losses and construction costs. First, an adaptive clustering partition method based on energy balance and load moments is proposed to determine the optimal location of energy hubs and to allocate each distributed generation and load to different energy hubs, forming multiple regional integrated energy systems adaptively. Then, the proposed hierarchical layout optimisation model is formulated as to find the modified minimum spanning tree of the regional integrated energy system and multi-regional integrated energy systems, respectively, to construct an economical and reliable interconnection network. Finally, the effectiveness of the optimisation model and strategy is verified by simulations.

AB The main aim of designing any energy system is to ensure that maximum energy is generated with minimum capital investment. Also, the cost associated with generating electricity from the system should also be minimum. In order to achieve these aims, integrated energy systems are to be designed and optimized in such a way that the best possible sizing of the components is obtained upon cost and other constraints. This paper gives the details of a solar photovoltaic (PV) and proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell based integrated energy system (IES) proposed in an Indian village. The estimation of the expected load profile of the village and optimization of the system is done using hybrid optimization model for electrical renewable (HOMER) software. The framework adopted for the optimization, the results obtained after simulation and their analysis have been included in detail. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nowadays, both of economy and sustainability are requirements for energy systems. This study proposes a Stackelberg-based bi-level integrated energy optimization system for examining the impact of different mechanisms on the low-carbon economy of integrated energy systems (IES) by considering energy interaction, demand response, carbon trading costs, and green certificate trading benefits. An IES is developed based on the reversible solid oxide cell (RSOC) and the combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) system. Eight scenarios are presented in order to investigate the impact of multiple mechanisms on the system. Carbon Emission Trading (CET) and Green Certificate Trading (GCT) significantly contribute to the utilization of renewable energy, thereby prompting IES to operate with low carbon emissions. Bi-level optimization adjusts the electricity price to influence dispatch of IESs, and the curtailment percentage is significantly reduced. Moreover, The Demand Response (DR) curve elucidates the system's propensity to supply energy at each period, which can help RDC set the electricity price accordingly. Finally, anew optimization method with fixed electrical trading prices from optimization result is implemented to analyze the sensitivity of parameters. The result shows that transferring carbon trading costs from the upper RDC level to the IES is abetter choice for carbon reduction than bi-level optimization when C>0.3.

AB This paper focuses on the day-ahead scheduling of a multi-carrier multi-microgrid that delivers electricity, heat, and hydrogen to its customers. The microgrids are equipped with renewable sources, combined heat and power, gas boiler, electric boiler, multi-energy storage, and power-to-hydrogen facilities, and aim at minimizing their operational and environmental costs. Demand response for electrical and hydrogen loads as well as thermal comfort for heat demand have been considered to increase flexibility. The distribution company, which aims at maximizing its profit, imports electricity and natural gas from the main grid. Stochastic optimization is proposed, and the generated scenarios were reduced using the mixed-integer linear programming method. Considering that the problem possesses two conflicting objective functions, the problem was two-level with nonlinear terms. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, duality theory, and Fortuny-Amat transformation were implemented to transfer the problem into a single-level mixed-integer linear programming problem. The effectiveness of the proposed framework in four cases has been tested on a hypothetical multi-carrier multi-microgrid. Energy storage, demand response, and thermal comfort resulted in a microgrid cost reduction of 12.31 % and a distribution company profit reduction of 17.25 %. According to the results, thermal comfort can reduce MGs costs remarkably since it adds more flexibility.

AB The inherent intermittency and fluctuation of renewable energy generation introduce uncertainty in electricity carbon emission intensity, posing challenges to the low-carbon and economic scheduling of integrated energy systems. To this end, this paper proposes an optimization model for integrated electricity-heat-gas energy system operation considering uncertain indirect carbon emission intensity. First, considering the tiered carbon trading mechanism, an optimization framework for a park-level model is developed. Then, polyhedral uncertainty sets are introduced to capture the uncertainties in renewable energy generation and carbon emission intensity, offering a flexible and intuitive approach to handling diverse uncertainty types. These uncertainty sets are integrated into the optimization problem to enhance robustness. Finally, the uncertainty set-based stochastic optimization method is introduced to improve the model's robustness, addressing both cost minimization and carbon reduction under uncertain conditions. Case studies using data from a Mediterranean-region hospital demonstrate the model's effectiveness in addressing uncertainties at park-level systems and providing robust solutions that balance cost efficiency and environmental impact.

DE Wind power; Energy storage; Grey wolf optimization; Capacity allocation;

AB Integrated energy systems play a crucial role in the transition to sustainable energy solutions, requiring a delicate balance between economic efficiency and reliability. Energy storage and demand response are pivotal components for managing power fluctuations and optimizing consumption. This paper introduces a hybrid approach that combines Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) with Local Search Heuristics (GWOLSH) to achieve optimal energy system configurations. The approach formulates a hybrid energy storage capacity allocation method that considers the needs of wind power companies and users. It begins by constructing load-shifting and load-reduction models based on flexible user-side load response characteristics. In a comparative analysis, GWOLSH exhibits superior performance over WSO and PSO, evidenced by achieving a lower cost reduction of 330,595 USD (GWOLSH) compared to 344,974 USD (WSO) and 350,694 USD (PSO), along with higher percentage improvements in system stability (0.38 % for GWOLSH, 0.39 % for GWO, and 0.40 % for Particle swarm optimization (PSO)) and greater user satisfaction levels (0.8985 for WSOLSH, 0.8930 for GWO, and 0.8928 for PSO). This hybrid configuration proves effective in enhancing both economic efficiency and system reliability, offering a promising solution for maintaining a consistent power supply amid fluctuations, identifying energy system configurations that enhance economic efficiency while bolstering system reliability to ensure a consistent power supply amid fluctuations.

AB Demand response has gradually evolved into integrated demand response (IDR) as energy integration technology develops in integrated energy systems (IESs). The IES has a large amount of data interaction and an increasing concern for users' privacy protection. Based on the combined cooling, heating, and power model, our study established an IDR management model considering demand-side energy coupling, focusing on cost optimization. In terms of privacy protection in the IDR management process, an optimization method based on the Adam algorithm was proposed. Only nonsensitive data, such as gradients, were transmitted during the processing of the Adam-based method by relying on a centralized iterative computing architecture similar to federated learning. Thus, privacy protection was achieved. The final simulation results proved that the proposed IDR management model had a cost reduction of more than 9% compared with a traditional power demand response. Further simulations based on this model showed that the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed Adam-based method are better than those of other distributed computing algorithms.

AB Promoting energy transformation in rural areas, building a Rural Integrated Energy System, and developing multi-energy complementary and comprehensive utilization of rural energy in accordance with local conditions are important paths to support global low-carbon transformation and rural revitalization. However, how to consider the coupling synergy of multiple devices and plan the capacity of multiple devices in rural energy systems in an economical, low-carbon, and reliable manner is an urgent issue facing the development of Rural Integrated Energy System. This paper proposes a bi-level programming optimization method of Rural Integrated Energy System based on coupling coordination degree of energy equipment. Firstly, a multi-dimensional rural user energy utilization framework is designed that comprehensively considers agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, and lifestyle. Secondly, the bi-level optimization model of the Rural Integrated Energy System based on the coupling coordination degree of energy equipment is constructed. The upper-level planning model puts forward the equipment coupling coordination degree, and determines the equipment selection scheme for different types of Rural Integrated Energy System planning. The lower-level planning model considers economy, low carbon, and reliability, and uses the improved multi-objective Harris Hawk optimization algorithm to solve the capacity of different energy equipment in the Rural Integrated Energy System. Finally, the effectiveness and scientific nature of the model and method proposed in this paper are verified by the Integrated Energy Systems of a rural area in the north of China. In addition, by comparing the equipment selection scheme with the traditional method, it can be found that the optimization scheme in this paper that considers the coupling coordination of energy equipment reduces the annualized total cost by 29.34 %, reduces the annual carbon emissions by 60.43 %, and increases the reliability by 15.85 %. The collaborative planning of energy economy, low carbon energy and reliable energy has been realized.

AB Under the low carbon background, a multi-objective scheduling model of electrical-thermal integrated energy system which aims at minimizing the integrated operating costs and minimizing the carbon trading costs is established. The uncertainty of wind power brings new challenge to integrated energy systems. In recent years, light robust optimization has been effectively applied to solve the uncertainty of wind power. However, traditional light robust optimization has the shortcomings of over-conservative decision or excessive violation of constraints. Therefore, light robustness coefficient is introduced to adjust the deterioration tolerance of the objective function. To constrain the relaxation, the relaxation threshold and the ladder penalty coefficient are defined to generate the ladder penalty cost. Then, the ladder light robust optimization is used to deal with the uncertainty of the source-load sides and a multi-objective scheduling model based on the ladder light robust optimization is proposed. Finally, the Multi-objective Optimization Bacterial Colony Chemotaxis (MOBCC) algorithm is used to solve the model. Simulations results show that the proposed model can reduce the total costs by 5.56% and the wind power curtailment rate to 0.45%. Furthermore, different schemes are compared to verify that the ladder light robust optimization can provide a trade-off between economy and conservation of the system.

AB In integrated energy systems, large fluctuations of renewable energies can be lowered effectively through optimal scheduling for the district heating and electric power systems. In this paper, an optimal scheduling scheme is proposed with the following steps: 1) A pipeline decomposition-based method is developed for improving the accuracy of the heating system model; 2) Based on the improved heating system model, a rolling optimization model for the operation of district heating and power systems is established considering the dynamic virtual energy storage of heating inertia in heating pipelines and buildings; 3) The inequality equations of electric power flows obtained by the second-order cone optimization are taken as parts of the constraints; 4) A cost-function that can evaluate the minimization of the differences between exchange power and day-ahead scheduling power in the future time is set. In theory, the proposed method can accurately predict the powers of renewable energies and outdoor temperature several steps ahead. For verification, an integrated energy system composed of an IEEE-33 bus and a 13-pipeline heating system is applied to testing. The results show that the method has the capability of smoothing out the power fluctuations caused by renewable energies and load uncertainty.

AB The urgent need to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 has led to a growing focus on innovative approaches to producing, storing, and consuming energy. Integrated energy systems (IES) have emerged as a promising solution, capitalising on synergies between energy networks and enhancing efficiency. Such a holistic approach enables the integration of renewable energy sources and flexibility provision from one energy network to another, reducing emissions while facilitating strategies for operational optimisation of energy systems. However, emphasis has been mostly made on steady-state methodologies, with a dynamic verification of the optimal solutions not given sufficient attention. To contribute towards bridging this research gap, a methodology to verify the outcomes of an optimisation algorithm is presented in this paper. The methodology has been applied to assess the operation of a civic building in the UK dedicated to health services. This has been done making use of real energy demand data. Optimisation is aimed at improving power dispatch of the energy system by minimising operational costs and carbon emissions. To quantify potential discrepancies in power flows and operational costs obtained from the optimisation, a dynamic model of the IES that better captures real-world system operation is employed. By incorporating slow transients of thermal systems, control loops, and non-linearity of components in the dynamic model, often overlooked in traditional optimisation modules, the methodology provides a more accurate assessment of energy consumption and operational costs. The effectiveness of the methodology is assessed through model-in-the-loop co-simulations between MATLAB/Simulink and Apros alongside a series of scenarios. Results indicate significant discrepancies in power flows and operational costs between the optimisation and the dynamic model. These findings illustrate potential limitations of conventional operational optimisation modules in addressing real-world complexities, emphasising the significance of dynamic verification methods for informed energy management and decision-planning.

AB The unbalance between the renewable energy sources and user loads reduces the performance improvement of regional integrated energy systems (RIES), in which the multi-energy storage system with battery and heat tank is necessarily integrated. This paper aims to optimize the sites and capacities of multi-energy storage systems in the RIES. A RIES model including renewable wind power, power distribution network, district heating network, multi-energy storage system, and heat pump to convert electricity to heat is constructed. An optimization method combining a mixed-integer nonlinear programming optimization model is proposed to minimize the comprehensive cost of RIES. The second-order cone relaxation method performs convex relaxation of the power flow constraints, and the district heat network is operated under a constant-flow-variable-temperature strategy. The original optimization model is transformed into a mixed-integer second-order cone programming problem to solve. Three solution methods, including enumeration method, improved enumeration method and genetic algorithm, are employed to determine the optimum installation locations, and they are compared in computation time and efficiency. The results demonstrate that the distributed hybrid integration of electricity and thermal energy storages improves the RIES economy by collaborating the power and heat balances and reducing the purchased electricity from the grid. By integrating the hybrid storage system, the curtailed wind is reduced by 53.9%, and the economy is improved by 13.4%.

AB Now that China has outlined its goals of "carbon peak and carbon neutrality", the development of clean energy will accelerate, the connection between different energy systems will be closer, and the development prospects of the integrated energy service industry will be broader. Integrated energy services are promoting energy transformation and services. "Carbon peaking, carbon neutrality" and other aspects will also have multiple values and far-reaching significance. Before implementing integrated energy services, the top-level design of integrated energy system planning must be carried out, and how to achieve the optimal allocation of capacity in the field of integrated energy systems is an urgent problem to be solved in integrated energy system planning. This paper combines practical engineering experience and the latest theoretical research results to creatively introduce, for the first time, a comprehensive evaluation into the initial planning stage, and proposes, also for the first time, a three-level multi-element comprehensive energy system planning optimization method which combines multi-element requirements to carry out comprehensive energy system planning and optimization. The three-tier planning and optimization solution results in the optimal planning scheme of the integrated energy system, thereby making the scheme more specific and reliable. According to the demand data of an industrial park, this method was applied to complete a case analysis of integrated energy system planning, which verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the method. This method is easy to popularize, and it will guide the planning of integrated energy systems, promote integrated energy services, promote energy transition, and make positive contributions to achieve carbon neutrality as soon as possible.

AB To balance the stability and economic benefits of integrated energy systems (IES) during low-carbon optimization, this paper proposes a two-stage robust optimization scheduling method that considers ammonia energy and waste heat utilization. Firstly, this paper analyzes the Power-to-Ammonia (P2A) operational mechanism and the energy input-output transformation relationship and establishes a Power-to-Ammonia equipment model incorporating waste heat utilization. Subsequently, the low-carbon operational characteristics of the integrated energy system with cooperative operation between Power-to-Ammonia and coal-fired units are explored by integrating Power-to-Ammonia with ammonia-coal co-firing technology. Then, the paper uses an adjustable uncertainty set to describe the variability of renewable generation (RG) and constructs a max-min structured integrated energy system with a two-stage robust optimization scheduling model to minimize the worst-case scenario system operating costs. Finally, the Column-and-Constraint Generation (C&CG) algorithm decomposes the two-stage robust optimization issue into a master problem and sub-problems for the iterative solution. Furthermore, the proposed method is simulated in an actual integrated energy system in northern China. Simulation results indicate that with the intervention of renewable generation uncertainty, the model developed in this study reduces operating costs and carbon emissions by 13.98 % and 20.95 %, respectively, effectively enhancing the capability for low-carbon economic operation. This study provides crucial theoretical support for advancing the low-carbon energy conversion of integrated energy systems.

AB Globally, countries have established timelines and technological pathways towards achieving "carbon neutrality". Regional integrated energy systems, as an efficient and clean mode of energy provision, are particularly suitable for supplying various forms of energy to building users. However, due to the complexity of their structure and multiple energy flow couplings, regional integrated energy systems face challenges in system optimization, warranting further exploration in design optimization and benefit analysis. Therefore, a regional integrated energy system was established, integrating renewable energy, energy storage, and power/thermal sharing between stations. A multi-objective optimization model for the regional integrated energy system was established, targeting economic benefits, carbon reduction, and reliability. Overall benefits of the internal energy stations in the regional integrated energy system were meticulously analyzed, considering system benefits, inter-station energy sharing, and energy storage. Research findings indicate, the regional integrated energy system constructed in this study exhibited superior energy-saving, carbon reduction, and independence, compared to other integrated energy systems. For the proposed system, the annual total cost was 38.41 CNY/m2, primary energy consumption stood at 16.26 kWh/m2, carbon emission was recorded at 4.33 kg/m2, and the system interaction power measured 9.99 kWh/m2. Final, this study provides theoretical support for the application and promotion of regional integrated energy systems.

AB This study proposes a two-level optimization scheduling method for multi-region integrated energy systems (IESs) that considers dynamic time intervals within the day, addressing the diverse energy characteristics of electricity, heat, and cooling. The day-ahead scheduling aims to minimize daily operating costs by optimally regulating controllable elements. For intra-day scheduling, a predictive control-based dynamic rolling optimization model is utilized, with the upper-level model handling slower thermal energy fluctuations and the lower-level model managing faster electrical energy fluctuations. Building on the day-ahead plan, different time intervals are used for fast and slow layers. The slow layer establishes a decision index for command cycle intervals, dynamically adjusting based on ultra-short-term forecasts and incremental balance corrections. Case studies demonstrate that this method effectively leverages energy network characteristics, optimizes scheduling intervals, reduces adjustment costs, and enhances system performance, achieving coordinated operation of the IES network and multi-energy equipment.

AB In the context of dual-carbon goals, it is essential to coordinate low-carbon policies and technologies. As a promising approach for clean energy integration, the combined heat-power-hydrogen virtual power plant (CHP-H VPP) effectively consolidates electricity, heat, and hydrogen to meet increasing energy demands and reduce carbon emissions. To this end, this paper proposes an optimal scheduling method for CHP-H VPPs based on a stepped carbon trading mechanism. First, at the low-carbon technology level, a CHP-H VPP architecture is constructed, incorporating thermal power units, hydrogen-doped gas turbines, hydrogen-doped gas boilers, and two-stage power-to-gas (P2G) systems. Second, at the policy level, a stepped carbon trading model is established to constrain system carbon emissions and an optimization model is formulated to minimize operating costs and emissions. Finally, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with linearly decreasing constraints is employed to refine solution accuracy and accelerate convergence by progressively narrowing the search space and guiding the algorithm toward optimal solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model enhances both the economic performance and carbon-reduction capabilities of the system; the simulation results also show that the proposed model effectively improves economic returns by reducing operating costs and enhancing carbon-reduction capacity, with a 7% reduction in run time.

AB The optimal operation of integrated energy systems (IESs) is of great significance to facilitate the penetration of distributed generators and improve its overall efficiency. A grid-connected IES is proposed in this paper for the synergetic interactions of electricity, thermal and gas energy flows, in which the biogas-solar-wind complementarities are fully considered and the digester heating is applied to provide an appropriate temperature for biogas production from anaerobic digestion. Its multi-objective optimization (MOO) model is constructed to optimize the operational cost, carbon dioxide emission and energy loss while considering digesting thermodynamic effects for anaerobic digester and uncertainty of wind and solar power, which is then compared to that of a natural gas-solar-wind IES. Thereafter, we develop an improved realization of multitasking paradigm within the domain of MOO to simultaneously solve the multi-objective operation optimization of the two IESs. In the associated multitasking algorithm, the underlying similarities of distinct optimization tasks are learned online to mitigate the harmful inter-task interactions and thereby facilitate improved convergence characteristics. The efficacy of the proposed multitasking algorithm has been comprehensively assessed on a novel biogas-solar-wind IES and a natural gas-solar-wind IES. Simulation results validated that the proposed IES can be operated in a more cost-efficient and environmentally friendly manner by comparing to the natural gas-solar-wind IES; the developed multitasking MOO algorithm can provide a better performance than other state-of-art multitask and single-task optimization algorithms.

AB Distributed power systems in the U.S. and globally are evolving to provide reliable and clean energy to consumers. In California, existing regulations require significant increases in renewable generation, as well as identification of customer-side Distributed Energy Resources (DER) controls, communication technologies, and standards for interconnection with the electric grid systems. As DER deployment expands, customer-side DER control and optimization will be critical for system flexibility and demand response (DR) participation, which improves the economic viability of DER systems. Current DER systems integration and communication challenges include leveraging the existing DER and DR technology and systems infrastructure, and enabling optimized cost, energy and carbon choices for customers to deploy interoperable grid transactions and renewable energy systems at scale.
   This paper presents a cost-effective solution to these challenges by exploring communication technologies and information models for DER system integration and interoperability. This system uses open standards and optimization models for resource planning based on dynamic-pricing notifications and autonomous operations within various domains of the smart grid energy system. It identifies architectures and customer engagement strategies in dynamic DR pricing transactions to generate feedback information models for load flexibility, load profiles, and participation schedules. The models are tested at a real site in California Fort Hunter Liggett (FHL). The results for FHL show that the model fits within the existing and new DR business models and networked systems for transactive energy concepts. Integrated energy systems, communication networks, and modeling tools that coordinate supply-side networks and DER will enable electric grid system operators to use DER for grid transactions in an integrated system.

AB Integrated energy systems (IESs) strengthen electricity-gas-heat multi-energy coupling and reduce wind and light abandonment. For grids with superior distribution, IESs are similar to virtual energy storage systems and are able to realize efficient interaction with the grid by synergizing the operating status of the internal equipment and improving the security, economy, and flexibility of the grid's operation. However, the internal equipment coupling of an IES is complex, and determining how to evaluate its adjustable capacity range (that is, the upper and lower boundaries of its external energy demand) considering the uncertainty and volatility of wind power and photovoltaic output is a problem to be solved. To solve this problem, this paper presents a chance-constrained evaluation method for the adjustable capacity of IESs. Firstly, mathematical models and operational constraints of each device within the IES are established. Secondly, based on the mathematical model of chance-constrained planning, an adjustable capacity range assessment model considering the uncertainty of wind and photovoltaic output is established. Finally, the MATLAB/Yalmip/Gurobi solver is used for the optimization solution, and the adjustable capacity range interval of the constructed IES model is solved using an arithmetic example to analyze and verify the correctness and validity of the method and to study the influencing factors of its adjustable range.

AB With the increasing power demand of water distribution systems, utilizing pumps and water tanks as flexibility resources for the power system can effectively enhance the operational flexibility and efficiency of integrated energy systems. This paper proposes a data-assisted two-stage robust optimization method, incorporating a dynamic risk tolerance adjustment mechanism, to coordinate the operation of power and water supply systems, improve renewable energy penetration, and reduce overall operational costs. The proposed method first employs data-assisted techniques to generate uncertainty predictions and applies two-stage robust optimization to determine safe operational boundaries. Then, a convex hull method is used to construct probabilistic operation regions under different scheduling risk tolerances. Simultaneously, a dynamic risk tolerance adjustment mechanism is introduced, where the risk tolerance parameter is iteratively updated based on real-time evaluation indices to enhance the system's adaptability to uncertainties. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively coordinates power-water system operations, enhances the flexibility of the water distribution system, improves renewable energy utilization, and reduces peak loads and reserve capacity requirements in the power system. Furthermore, the dynamic risk tolerance adjustment mechanism and probabilistic operation regions enrich scheduling strategies, enabling the system to dynamically optimize scheduling schemes based on load fluctuations and renewable energy forecasting accuracy, achieving an optimal balance between security and economy.

AB The operation of energy systems considering a multi-carrier scheme takes several advantages of economical, environmental, and technical aspects by utilizing alternative options is supplying different kinds of loads such as heat, gas, and power. This study aims to evaluate the influence of power to hydrogen conversion capability and hydrogen storage technology in energy systems with gas, power, and heat carriers concerning risk analysis. Accordingly, conditional value at risk (CVaR)-based stochastic method is adopted for investigating the uncertainty associated with wind power production. Hydrogen storage system, which can convert power to hydrogen in off-peak hours and to feed generators to produce power at on-peak time intervals, is studied as an effective solution to mitigate the wind power curtailment because of high penetration of wind turbines in electricity networks. Besides, the effect constraints associated with gas and district heating network on the operation of the multi-carrier energy systems has been investigated. A gas-fired combined heat and power (CHP) plant and hydrogen storage are considered as the interconnections among power, gas and heat systems. The proposed framework is implemented on a system to verify the effectiveness of the model. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the model in terms of handling the risks associated with multi-carrier system parameters as well as dealing with the penetration of renewable resources.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Hydrogen is characterized by zero carbon emissions and high energy density, which can effectively support the consumption of a high proportion of intermittent new energy. Considering the seasonal nature of renewable energy sources, a seasonal hydrogen storage model is incorporated in an electric-hydrogen integrated energy system (EH-IES). In this paper, a two-layer optimization method is proposed for EH-IES with seasonal hydrogen storage. The problem of co-optimizing the equipment capacity and configuration in the proposed system is coordinated by establishing a two-layer optimization framework. Specifically, the system is optimized to minimize cost and carbon emissions at the upper layer using the multi-objective stochastic paint optimizer (MOSPO) algorithm, with the capacity configuration results being transmitted to the lower layer. The lower layer, aiming to reduce the total system cost, utilizes a commercial solver to obtain the optimal economic scheduling results for a typical day. The final analysis of the four scenarios shows that the increase in renewable energy reduces the purchasing cost of electricity by 1.89%, while in contrast, the total cost increases by 4.4% in the system with a lower proportion of renewable energy. In the case of higher heating and cooling loads, the increase in renewables reduces the purchase cost of natural gas by 9.10%. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can leverage the seasonal complementary benefits to drive new energy consumption, enhance system operation efficiency, and effectively reduce EH-IES's total operation cost and carbon emission.

AB Integrated energy systems offer higher energy, environmental, and economic benefits than conventional separate systems. To comprehensively assess the performance of the integrated energy systems, applying life cycle assessment methods, the life-cycle primary energy saving ratio, renewable energy supply ratio, and electricity supply ratio are aggregated into a composite technical index, the life-cycle carbon dioxide emissions reduction ratio and life-cycle sulfur dioxide emissions reduction ratio are aggregated into a composite environmental index, and the life-cycle annual total costs and life-cycle annual costs saving ratio are aggregated into a composite economic index to fully assess the economic, technical, and environmental performances of the system. A new multi-objective optimization model is constructed with composite technical, economic, and environmental indices as objective functions. Optimization results indicate that under the optimal configuration, the composite technical, economic, and environmental indices of the system reach 0.894, 0.909, and 0.915. Compared to the reference system, the highest life-cycle primary energy saving ratio, life-cycle annual costs saving ratio, life-cycle carbon dioxide emissions reduction ratio, and life-cycle sulfur dioxide emissions reduction ratio are 31.20 %, 22.13 %, 52.70 %, and 88.90 %, respectively. The lowest life-cycle annual total costs are 67750.47 $, and the highest renewable energy supply ratio and electricity supply ratio are 59.22 % and 91.70 %, respectively. The multi-objective optimization model presented in this work offers a different viewpoint for comprehensively evaluating the technical, economic, and environmental performances of the integrated energy systems, which is predicted to guide the design of the integrated energy systems.

AB Based on analysis of construction and operation of micro integrated energy systems (MIES), this paper presents economic optimization for their configuration and sizing. After presenting typical models for MIES, a residential community MIES is developed by analyzing residential direct energy consumption within a general design procedure. Integrating with available current technologies and local resources, the systematic design considers a prime mover, fed by natural gas, with wind power, photovoltaic generation, and two storage devices serving thermal energy and power to satisfy cooling, heating and electricity demands. Control strategies for MIES also are presented in this study. Multi-objective formulas are obtained by analyzing annual cost and dumped renewable energy to achieve optimal coordination of energy supply and demand. According to historical load data and the probability distribution of distributed generation output, clustering methods based on K-means and discretization methods are employed to obtain typical scenarios representative of uncertainties. The modified non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm is applied to find the Pareto frontier of the constructed multi-objective formulas. In addition, aiming to explore the Pareto frontier, the dumped energy cost ratio is defined to check the energy balance in different MIES designs and provide decision support for the investors. Finally, simulations and comparision show the appropriateness of the developed model and the applicability of the adopted optimization algorithm.

AB As the integration and complexity of integrated energy systems (IES) continue to increase, the synergistic optimization of operation strategies and configuration schemes is encountering formidable challenges. This study presents a novel IES planning model that enables hierarchical optimization of operation strategies and configuration schemes, considering hybrid electric and thermal energy storage. In the initial phase, a population intelligence approach is employed to optimize the configuration scheme of the system. Subsequently, in the second stage, mathematical planning methods are utilized to optimize the operation strategy of the system, thereby further enhancing its performance. The case study reveals that the proposed hierarchical configuration and operation optimization model significantly improves the system's independence, energy, environmental, and economic performance compared to multiple operational strategies such as following electric load (FEL), following thermal load (FTL), and following hybrid load (FHL). Specifically, in comparison to rule-based operation strategies, the proposed model achieves a maximum annual cost-saving rate (ACSR), primary energy saving rate (PESR), pollution emission reduction rate (PERR), and performance comprehensive index (PCI) of 22.45 %, 35.73 %, 35.77 %, and 30.07 %, respectively. Additionally, through an in-depth comparative analysis of four scenarios, namely hybrid electro-thermal energy storage, electrical energy storage, thermal energy storage, and no energy storage, it is found that hybrid electro-thermal energy storage technology exhibits significant advantages in terms of enhancing energy efficiency, environmental friendliness, and operational independence of the IES.

AB The planning of integrated energy systems (IES) faces significant challenges due to the presence of multiple uncertainties caused by stochastic demands and renewable energy generation. Particularly, how to balance different conflicted objectives in IES planning under multiple uncertainties is a major obstacle with few studies. Thus, this paper proposes a novel multi -objective optimization framework (MOOF) for uncertain IES planning with demand response to achieve the synergistic enhancement of multiple performance indicators of the system while ensuring its flexibility and safety. The proposed MOOF encompasses several key steps. Firstly, a multiobjective optimization model under various uncertainties is constructed, with the minimization of investment and operating costs, maximization of exergy efficiency, and minimization of carbon emissions as optimization objectives. Secondly, the chance constraint approach is used to convert the constraint conditions into deterministic ones. Subsequently, the Pareto dominance concept is incorporated into robust, interval, and opportunistic optimization techniques to obtain three deterministic transformation methods for multi -objective optimization with uncertainty. Further, a high -efficiency constrained multi -objective coevolutionary algorithm (CMCA) is developed to solve the proposed planning model, which has the characteristics of nonlinearity, and highdimensional complexity. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed MOOF and CMCA is verified through numerous case studies.

AB Combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) integrated energy systems can realize the gradient utilization of energy and the coordination and complementarity of multiple energy sources, which is the primary choice for solving the energy crisis and alleviating the environmental pressure. However, most current design and operational optimizations for CCHP are performed under rule-based operational strategies. This paper constructs a two-level alternating optimization framework for the planning-operation of the CCHP system with an embedded scheduling strategy. The upper-level solves for the optimal capacity configuration of the system to optimize energy, economic and environmental performance, and the lower-level solves for the operating capacity of the equipment system to optimize the operation and maintenance cost. In order to obtain the optimal configuration scheme and scheduling strategy for the system, a novel multi-objective weIghted meaN oF vectOrs (MOINFO)mixed integer linear programming (MILP) method is proposed. The optimization results suggest that the hybrid CCHP for three buildings (market, office, and restaurant) under the two-level optimization model can achieve better economic, energy, and environmental performance than the rule-based single-level optimization model. Generally, for the market, office and restaurant, the two-Level model achieves maximum economic, energy and environmental performance improvements of 29.12%, 29.88%, and 42.13%; 38.32%, 19.56%, and 34.68%; and 47.37%, 30.93%, and 45.47%, respectively.

AB According to the necessity of establishing an effective, dependable, and cost-effective system to supply various demands, the significance of an energy hub has emerged in recent years. Also, the other aspect dealing with decreasing the global warming issues should be taken into account. To this end, a smart multicarrier energy hub (SMEH) coordinated with an integrated demand response program (IDRP) and hydrogen storage system (HSS) as flexible resources has been proposed. Managing the consumption of electrical and thermal demands is handled by IDRP, whilst fuel cell-based HSS technology has an important role in lessening the air pollutant emissions. In reality, HSS could convert electrical power to hydrogen energy via power to hydrogen (P2H) at low price hours or in high renewable energy resources (RERs) penetrations; however, at high price periods or in low RERs penetrations, electricity is generated through hydrogen-based fuel cells. In addition to the aforementioned parts, combined heat and power (CHP), boiler, gas-fired units (GFUs), HSS, electrical heat pump (EHP), energy and thermal storage systems (ESS/TSS), and RERs are also considered in the SMEH. The scenario-based stochastic method is utilized to handle the fluctuations of electricity price and RERs' output. The multiobjective scheduling framework of the problem is modeled as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) to investigate and obtain the economic-environmental benefits. Consequently, the applicability of the introduced methodology is verified via sample case studies. Simulation outcomes represent that applying IDRP and HSS results in a decrement in overall cost and total emission by about 1.54% and 2.9%, respectively.

AB Against the backdrop of rapidly increasing renewable energy penetration, many regions are facing the phenomenon of power abandonment. To enhance the absorption capacity of renewable energy, constructing an integrated energy system holds significant economic and environmental benefits. This study first introduces a power-to-gas (P2G) conversion technology incorporating an intermediate buffer link, and constructs an electricheat-hydrogen-natural gas energy hybrid storage system. The P2G process can be further detailed into two stages: power-to-hydrogen and power-to-natural gas, and a two-stage bidirectional coupling system of "electrichydrogen-electricity" and "electric-gas-electricity" is formed through fuel cells and gas turbines, respectively. Secondly, concentrated solar power plants and fuel cells are regarded as a novel combined heat and power (CHP) unit, replacing traditional CHP methods. Additionally, flexible load technology is introduced to participate in the scheduling of the integrated energy system. Finally, an economic dispatch model for the electric-heat-gas integrated energy system was developed, and the optimization problem was addressed using a mixed-integer programming algorithm. The results indicate that incorporating flexible loads reduces the total cost by 1.32 %, power curtailment losses by 13.93%, and the electric load peak-to-valley difference by 22.05%. With the integration of P2G technology, the total cost decreases by 1.92 %, and power curtailment losses by 79.92 %. The introduction of a novel CHP unit lowers the total cost by 5.88 %, cuts carbon emissions by 49.15 %, and decreases the all-day gas purchase by 24.49%. These results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Integrated energy systems (IES) have been applied to raise the efficiency of energy utilization and facilitate the sustainable transition of society and energy system. To further explore the multi-energy coupling capacity and carbon reduction potential of the IESs, this study proposes a cooling-heat-electricity-gas collaborative optimization model of IES given ladder carbon trading (LCT) mechanism and multi-energy demand response (MDR). To begin with, the MDR model is developed following the demand characteristics of the system. Given the incentive effect of the LCT on the low-carbon performance of the IESs, the multi-energy coupling low-carbon operation optimization model is proposed. By constructing four application scenarios, the proposed model is practiced in investigating the performance of IES across various market mechanisms. The simulation findings indicate the introduction of the LCT cuts the carbon emissions of the IES by approximately 6.7%, and the MDR mechanism effectively optimizes the energy use curve by regulating user behavior. The combined consideration of the two market mechanisms saves around 9.21% of the IES's operation cost and strengthens the performance of IES towards the green and economic operation. The carbon market requires rational prices to inspire IES. The proposed model offers a significant benchmark for the IES's green performance optimization.

Nevertheless, this method requires a high-value chain for application due to its high investment cost at present. Producing, and then selling, hydrogen via electrolyzers is more valuable than storing it for a later generation. The two hydrogen production methods of SMR and electrolysis can be combined with the operation optimization of electrical and natural gas systems to form a flexible energy-use mechanism. A model of the flexible energy-use mechanism is established. The model can be integrated into interdependent natural gas and electricity systems, aiming to alleviate the shortage of natural gas, improve energy efficiency and lower carbon emissions. To demonstrate the economic feasibility and carbon dioxide emissions reduction of the proposed mechanism, a bus-6 power system integrated with a node-6 natural gas system and an IEEE 30-bus system with a modified Belgian 20-node gas system are examined. It is concluded that the proposed flexible energy-use mechanism in the power and natural gas systems has higher economic value and lower carbon emissions than the power-to-hydrogen-to-methane-to-pipeline path.

AB The energy network is a hub center connecting the energy supply side and the energy demand side, which has high flexibility. At the same time, energy hub is the key to coupling different energy networks. Therefore, from the optimization of the output of the energy hub to the optimization of the coordinated operation state of the multi-energy network is the core of the regional integrated energy system operation optimization research. This paper focuses on the operation optimization of regional integrated energy systems based on modeling of Electricity-Thermal-Natural Gas Network. Firstly, a general model of Electricity network, Natural Gas network, and Thermal network is established, on this basis, according to the coupling mechanism of multi-energy network, a comprehensive model of Electricity-Thermal-Natural Gas coupling system is established. Secondly, considering the constraints such as energy balance and transmission power of external network, an economic dispatching model of regional integrated energy system considering ladder carbon trading mechanism is established with the objective of minimizing economic cost. Thirdly, Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm is used to solve the economic dispatch model, and the optimization results of the energy hub are obtained. Combined with the general energy network model, the optimization results of each energy network are further obtained according to the characteristics of energy balance and energy flow transmission of the system, including equipment output, gas turbine efficiency, thermal medium velocity, etc. Finally, in order to illustrate the advantages of this method, "Following power load", "Following heat load", and "Optimal scheduling" are set up in the simulation, and the simulation results show that the total operation cost of "Optimal scheduling" mode is reduced by 8.44% and the environmental emission is reduced by 15.03% compared with the other two modes, and the technical and economic characteristics of "Optimal scheduling" mode have strong advantages in the three modes.

AB Introducing electric and thermal energy storage into Combined Cooling, Heating, and Power (CCHP) systems can greatly reduce dependence on fossil fuels and significantly decrease greenhouse gas emissions. This study proposes a distributed collaborative optimization operational strategy for integrated energy systems in industrial parks based on a leader-follower game framework. In this approach, the integrated energy seller serves as the leader. At the same time, new energy-based CCHP operators and load aggregators act as followers, working out their interaction strategies to achieve optimal objectives. First, the mathematical model of the industrial park's integrated energy system is presented and embedded within a leader-follower game framework that incorporates tiered carbon trading and demand response, thereby establishing a one-leader-multiple-followers distributed collaborative optimization model. Second, an improved Integrated Arctic Puffin (IAPO) optimization method is combined with the CPLEX solver to determine the optimal layout and operational plan for the developed optimization model. Finally, case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating that both the supply-side revenue and the demand-side consumer surplus are enhanced. The case study results indicate that the proposed two-tier optimization model achieves significant improvements of 10.47 % and 16.18 % in economic and environmental performance, respectively. In comparison, the storage systems' charge-discharge cycle depth and effective capacity utilisation rate are improved by 17.21 % and 21.85 %, respectively.

AB The operational performance of integrated energy systems (IESs) varies with their configuration. The equipment model directly influences the capacity configuration of IESs. The conventional static model assumes that equipment efficiency is constant, ignoring its off-design characteristics. For this reason, this paper establishes a dynamic model considering the off-design characteristics of the equipment. Based on the dynamic and static models, bi-level optimization models with the minimum total cost as the optimization objective are established to optimize the configuration of IESs, and the optimization results are System 1 and System 2, respectively. Then, the operational performance of the two systems under the dynamic optimal scheduling model is compared. The results demonstrate that the capacity of the absorption chiller (ABC), combined heating and power (CHP) unit in System 1 are larger than in System 2 owing to the difference in equipment models, whereas the capacity of ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) shows the opposite trend. The larger capacity of the GSHP increases the grid power consumption of System 2 but also reduces its operating efficiency. The greater operation energy con-sumption and grid power consumption make the operating cost, carbon tax, and total cost of System 2 under the design condition higher than that of System 1, with an increased rate of 1.38%, 3.47%, and 1.14%, respectively. As with the design condition, the carbon tax, operating cost, and total cost of System 2 are higher than those of System 1 under both summer and winter operating conditions, particularly under summer operating conditions, where the carbon tax, operating cost, and total cost increase by 2.27%, 1.24%, and 0.88% respectively. Even if the energy price changes, the carbon tax, operating cost and total cost of System 2 in a typical year are still greater than those of System 1. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the off-design characteristics of equipment in the bi-level optimization design model.

AB With the popularization of renewable energy and widespread use of electric vehicles (EVs) and hydrogen fuel energy vehicles (HFEVs), the coupling between renewable energy and urban transportation systems (UTSs) and power distribution grids is deepening, and the impact of large-scale HFEV deployment on power distribution networks (PDNs) is increasing. A spatiotemporal model of the impact on the urban distribution network in the case of large-scale access to EVs and HFEVs was established in this article. Based on the simulation of EV and HFEV travel paths, a spatiotemporal model of the UTS electric load was obtained. In addition, distributed hydrogen refueling stations were modeled, including electrolyzers and hydrogen storage stations. To achieve low-cost operation of the integrated energy system, a cost optimization model based on the integration of electricity, hydrogen, transportation, and natural gas was proposed. Finally, based on operational data of the integrated system, the simultaneous integration of EVs and HFEVs into the comprehensive urban energy system was simulated, and numerical analysis was performed. The results showed that when EVs and HFEVs were connected to the comprehensive urban energy system in different proportions, they could exert different impacts on the system, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed model.

AB For a few decades, operators of energy systems have sought to achieve appropriate frameworks due to energy crises and rapid growth in energy requirements. In this regard, this study presents a multi-objective optimization model for an energy hub (EH) designed to manage a diverse energy portfolio. The EH receives electricity, natural gas, hydrogen, seawater, and solar energy as inputs, aiming to satisfy electricity, heating, and freshwater demands at the output port while considering a limited available area. The model incorporates the selection of the optimal solar energy technology (photovoltaics, parabolic dish, or parabolic trough collector) through a comprehensive evaluation encompassing technical, economic, and environmental aspects. To achieve optimal scheduling of the EH's production units, the model factors in forecasts of solar energy availability alongside electrical, heat, and water load demands. The evaluation of the EH's performance is conducted through a multiobjective framework considering social welfare, CO2 emissions, voltage stability margin (VSM), a newly proposed simplified fast temperature stability index (SFTSI), and a similarly novel simplified fast pressure stability index (SFPSI). The optimization problem is formulated within a MATLAB environment and solved using a multiobjective Archimedes optimization algorithm across five distinct case studies, each characterized by a varying designated area for solar energy generation. The effectiveness of the proposed model and optimization technique is validated through test systems, with the obtained results demonstrating significant improvements compared to a baseline scenario. These improvements include a 36.18% reduction in CO2 emissions, a 14.22% increase in total social welfare, and reductions in the average values of VSM, SFTSI, and SFPSI when incorporating all solar energy technologies.

AB Amid surging global energy demands and worsening environmental decay, Community Integrated Energy Systems offer a viable solution through the coordination of diverse energy sources and technologies. With the goal of minimizing operating costs and carbon emissions while maintaining the power balance of electricity, cooling, heating, and natural gas, this study proposes an optimization scheduling strategy of the community integrated energy system combined with integrated demand response. Through a case study, the community integrated energy system involvement in integrated demand response was rigorously assessed and the impact of altering PV penetration rates was examined. The results indicate that application integration demand response can effectively reduce 20.26 % of the total system operating costs by shifting both peak load of electricity and heating or cooling. And the transferable and reduced loads in integrated demand response perform better than the replaceable load. The empirical analysis also confirms a 31.39 % reduction in total operational costs and a 25.51 % decrease in carbon emissions upon increasing the PV penetration rate from 20 % to 50 %, demonstrating the dual benefits of economic efficiency and environmental sustainability. This work serves as a pivotal reference for future policy formulation in sustainable community energy systems.

AB Facing the growing pressure of climate change and environmental protection, integrated energy systems (IESs), which comprise different energy sources, have become promising candidates for future energy systems. However, the capacity configuration of each source remains challenging due to the various couplings, randomness of renewables and numerical optimization difficulty. In this paper, a hierarchical optimization framework is proposed to determine the component capacities of trigeneration IESs, i.e., systems involving combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) generation. The potential variation in the demand and renewable resource availability are considered stochastic factors and captured as scenarios generated according to a probability function. In the first level, with the component capacities and scenarios defined, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem is formulated to minimize the total system cost. Then, in the second level, the Monte Carlo method is applied to calculate the expectation by feeding different scenarios into the MILP and sampling the minimal costs. Finally, as the second level returns the expected value of the system cost considering the given component capacities, a genetic algorithm is adopted in the third level to search the optimal component capacities. Compared to the conventional deterministic optimization method, the proposed stochastic optimization method reduces the annual operational cost while allowing a wider operational range. In addition, it is revealed that the inclusion of heat storage and grid connections yields notable benefits in terms of IES cost reduction. Graphic abstract

AB With the increasing uncertainty of energy supply side output, fully encouraging users to participate in demand response through different types of demand response incentive mechanisms has become one of the effective ways to deal with the uncertainty of integrated energy system operation and improve the overall energy efficiency. However, in existing studies, the coordination of uncertainty handling, optimization of demand response incentive strategies, and demand response measures at different time scales have not been adequately considered in the operation of integrated energy systems. Based on these considerations, this paper proposes a multi timescale game optimization scheduling model for Park-level Integrated Energy System considering multiple types of demand response models. In the day-ahead stage, a Park-level Integrated Energy System optimization game scheduling model based on the demand response comprehensive incentive mechanism is established, and the uncertainty of the predicted value of distributed renewable energy and multi-type energy load was characterized based on the fuzzy chance-constrained programming method. In the intraday and real-time stages, a rolling optimization scheduling model is established with the minimum cost of Park-level Integrated Energy System operator scheduling. For the proposed model, an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm and an iterative solution strategy of CPLEX solver are introduced. Finally, the simulation results of an actual case show that the proposed model can effectively improve the Park-level Integrated Energy System operator and user economy while ensuring reliability.

AB An integrated energy system interconnects multiple energies and presents a potential for economics improvement and energy sustainability, which has attracted extensive attention. However, due to the obvious volatility of energy demands, most existing integrated energy systems cannot operate in a totally self-sufficient way but interact with the upper grid frequently. With the increasingly urgent demand for energy saving and emissions reduction, renewable resources have occupied a larger and larger proportion in energy system, and at last they may be dominant in the future. Unlike conventional fossil fuel generation, the renewable resources are less controllable and flexible. To ease the pressure and guarantee the upper grid security, a more independent integrated energy system is required. Driven by that, this paper firstly reviews the optimal strategies considering both independence and benefit from perspectives of individual efforts and union efforts. Firstly, the general optimization process is summarized in terms of energy flows modelling and optimization methods to coordinate supply-demand side and realize benefit maximization. Based on that, handling with uncertainty of high-ratio renewable energy is reviewed from uncertainty modeling methods and multi-stage operation strategy perspectives to make the strategy accurate and reduce the adverse effects on the upper grid. Then, the hybrid timescale characteristics of different energy flows are explored to enhance operation flexibility of integrated energy systems. At last, the coordination among different participants is reviewed to reduce the whole adverse effect as a union. Remarks are conducted in the end of each part and further concluded in the final part. Overall, this study summarizes the research directions in operation optimization of integrated energy systems to cater for a renewable energy dominated scene to inspire the latter research.

AB Energy interactions across integrated energy systems constitute crucial means to enhance energy efficiency and match supply and demand. However, the cooperative operation and benefit distribution among multiple integrated energy systems still need in-depth exploration. To fill this gap, this paper presents an asymmetric Nash bargaining optimization model for multiple integrated energy systems considering peer-to-peer trading. First, a scheduling model for multi-integrated energy systems is formulated considering carbon trading. Then, the model is incorporated into Nash bargaining framework and transformed into the alliance cost minimization subproblem and peer-to-peer trading payment bargaining subproblem. The bargaining power factor is introduced to measure the contribution of participants in energy sharing. The alternating direction multiplier method is utilized to handle the proposed model. Finally, a case study is carried out to validate the validity of the proposed strategy. The results show that compared with the independent operation mode, the performances of three integrated energy systems in collaborative operation mode are enhanced by 11.7 %, 9.0 %, and 4.8 % respectively. The distributed algorithm can reduce the computation time by 30 % and obtain highly efficient solutions while protecting private information of each participant. This research provides support and practical tools for conducting peer-to-peer transactions of multiple integrated energy systems.

AB Integrated energy systems (IESs) integrate and coordinate multiple types of energy resources, which feature enhanced energy efficiency in a wide area. Herein, energy cascading utilization technique is an effective way for multiple IESs to improve the energy utilization efficiency and reduce the operation cost by reutilizing the waste heat in the optimal dispatch model. In this paper, we focus on the small-sized IES which can refer to a plant. Here, an economic dispatch model is set up for multiple IESs to obtain an optimal dispatch decision with energy cascading utilization techniques. Furthermore, in order to preserve the privacy of participating plants, a decentralized optimization framework is proposed to solve the optimal dispatch model using an alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM), where only a limited set of information is shared among participants while convergence is guaranteed. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and its solution method.

AB The integration of multi-energy within distribution networks has escalated the need for efficient operation and control of integrated energy systems (IES). Addressing the complexities of real-time scheduling and low-carbon optimization, we propose a novel artificial intelligence driven multi-agent system (MAS) approach for modeling the interactions and operations within the multi-agent integrated energy systems (MA-IES) framework. In this framework, distinct components such as electric, gas, and heat networks are conceptualized as autonomous agents, each responsible for managing its domain while interacting with other agents to achieve system-wide efficiency and economical goals. The agents communicate and coordinate through a distributed online optimization framework, utilizing the alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM) to ensure effective consensus despite the inherent nontransparency of information exchange. This MAS based approach allows for dynamic adaptation of strategies based on local data and global objectives, significantly enhancing the responsiveness and adaptability of MA-IES. We further integrate an objective function reliant on a tiered carbon pricing mechanism to assess and minimize the environmental impact of operations. Enhanced by adaptive penalty coefficients within the ADMM, our MA-IES framework demonstrates improved convergence rates and robustness in operational scenarios. Empirical validation through detailed case studies confirms the superior performance of our MAS-based model, demonstrating its potential to realize an efficient and economical low-carbon operation of MA-IES.

AB This study proposes an optimized economic scheduling strategy for multi-energy-integrated highway service centers (MEIHSCs) within a 24 h operational timeframe. With the imperative of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, highway areas are increasingly incorporating renewable energy systems, such as photovoltaic arrays, to capitalize on abundant resources along highways. Considering the diverse load demands of new energy vehicles and the mismatch between energy supply and demand on the highway, MEIHSCs must adapt to these trends by establishing integrated networks for electricity, natural gas, and hydrogen refueling. However, there is a lack of coordination between equipment switching and the phases of low electricity prices and peak renewable energy periods. To address this challenge and improve economic efficiency, this study proposes an economic dispatch strategy that combines economic incentives based on carbon trading and critical peak pricing mechanisms. This strategy aims to maximize economic benefits while fully meeting the load demands of new energy vehicles. Case studies indicate that operating costs are reduced by 28.04% compared to strategies without new energy installations, and by 47.85% compared to strategies without optimization. The results demonstrate that this integrated and optimized strategy significantly reduces energy costs and enhances economic benefits in highway service centers.

AB A new integrated energy plant is suggested and studied in the current research, aiming at enhancing the exergetic efficiency and minimizing the total product cost of a waste-to-energy (WTE) plant. For the integration, the condenser of the WTE plant is substituted with a thermoelectric generator. Accordingly, the conventional and integrated energy systems are studied comprehensively from energy, exergy, exergoeconomic, and environmental viewpoints and compared together. The parametric study indicated that the proposed system has important advantages over the conventional WTE plant, demonstrating higher exergy efficiency, higher power output, lower total product cost, and lower CO2 emission. In addition, the suggested integrated model is optimized using a multi-criteria optimization (MCO) approach with a specific MATLAB program. The MCO analysis for the best operating point reveals an exergetic efficiency of 17.22% and total cost rate of 184.2 $/h. Furthermore, investigating the scatter distribution of the effective parameters demonstrates that the TEG inlet pressure and figure of merit are the most sensitive parameters and should be kept at their lowest value. It can be concluded that the proposed integration would improve the performance of WTE plants while reducing the total product cost and levelized CO2 emissions.

AB Two of the most critical issues encountered in the day-ahead scheduling of regional integrated energy systems are the uncertainty of renewable energy resources and complexity of load demand. Furthermore, varying operating conditions also pose challenges for economical day-ahead scheduling. This paper proposes a scenario-based dayahead scheduling approach for regional integrated energy systems to minimize operating costs by mining historical data. A hybrid dynamic energy hub model with variable efficiency that integrates an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm and analytical formulation is proposed. We developed a scenario-based scheduling optimization model in which climate data and load data are predicted using XGBoost and the probability distributions of their predicted errors are estimated using a Gaussian mixture model. Monte Carlo simulation and Kmeans clustering were used to generate and reduce scenarios and a success-history-based adaptive differential evolution algorithm was adopted to search for optimal solutions for day-ahead scheduling. Furthermore, a weighted average electricity purchasing strategy was adopted to address uncertainty and further improve operating economy by adjusting the output of gas turbines and electricity purchasing for actual scheduling. Case studies were conducted to verify that the proposed approach can reduce daily operating costs and enhance the operating economy of regional integrated energy systems.

AB Integrated energy systems (IES) can help achieve greater energy efficiency, and then ultimately promote a climate-neutral economy by utilizing local renewable resources. Demand-side energy-saving measures can reduce operational costs associated with energy usage. Most existing IES models, however, focus on supply-side optimization, while the demand-side energy-saving potential and its impacts on whole-system performance are still not clear. The increasing carbon tax makes it even more important to understand the interactions between supply and demand sides to achieve a sustainable system with a minimal carbon charge. Hence, this study proposes a co-optimization model to simultaneously optimize the supply and demand sides of an IES considering the impact of the carbon tax. A selection tree is developed to describe various demand-side envelope upgrading technologies, and a binary tree is established by generating a set of supply-side scenarios with corresponding probabilities. Based on these results, an improved two-stage stochastic programming model is proposed. The robustness of the modeling results was further validated by a simulation-optimization-based uncertainty analysis addressing price uncertainties. A case study in Shanghai indicates that the proposed co-optimization model achieves more cost-efficient solutions than supply-side-only optimization considering carbon tax. Introducing carbon tax can reduce the installed capacity of fuel-based energy technologies by up to 24% and greatly accelerate the penetration of renewables. The increasing carbon tax also promotes the adoption of more advanced energy-saving technologies. Uncertainty analysis reveals acceptable robustness of the optimal demand-side scheme and supply-side configuration with a deviation of less than 5% and a coefficient of variation of 7%. Overall, the observations of the proposed model and case study provide valuable insights for IES design considering an emerging charge of carbon tax.

AB Achieving resilience enhancement and carbon neutrality is a pressing global goal, and integrated energy systems (IESs) are emerging as a promising solution to meet the growing energy demands of diverse users sustainably and economically. However, the intricate structure and energy flow couplings within IESs present significant challenges for system optimization. This study introduces a novel multi-objective optimization model for designing and enhancing a Renewable Integrated Energy System (RIES) that incorporates renewable energy sources, energy storage technologies, and energy sharing mechanisms. The proposed method combines a gravity search algorithm (GSA) with a multi-objective optimization framework to enhance resilience, carbon reduction, and economic benefits. By integrating energy storage and renewable energy, the RIES minimizes energy losses and addresses the mismatch between renewable energy generation and user demand. The effectiveness of the proposed system was verified through a case study based on a standard IEEE test system. The experimental results demonstrate that adding wind turbines reduces system generation by 6.61 %, energy storage integration further reduces generation by 9.4 %, and including photovoltaics achieves a total reduction of 10.8 %. Furthermore, the proposed demand response program (DRP) effectively balances electricity supply and demand, achieving a 45 % reduction in the daily peak load. Optimization results also reveal that renewable energy utilization improves by 0.77 %, highlighting the enhanced operational efficiency and resilience of the system. This work presents a comprehensive framework for optimizing integrated energy systems, offering theoretical guidance and practical solutions for energy planners and policymakers.

AB In order to facilitate more renewable energy and reduce carbon emissions, a novel structure of the virtual power plant (VPP) is designed including the power-to-hydrogen (PtH) equipment and the steam methane reforming (SMR) plant, as well as adjustable load, energy storage devices and wind power plants. On this basis, a flexible carbon emission mechanism is proposed based on the energy coordination among power-to-hydrogen equipment, SMR plants and gas-fired units. Under this new structure and carbon emission mechanism, the VPP makes purchasing and selling decisions in the day-ahead and real-time markets and optimizes the operating strategies of its internal components. It is established both of a deterministic model and a robust optimization model for purchasing and selling strategies of the VPP considering flexible carbon emission mechanism in this paper. In addition, the two models are simulated and analyzed. According to the simulation results, the VPP, based on the proposed new structure and flexible carbon emission mechanism, can not only make steady profits, but also facilitate more wind energy, while meeting the demand for hydrogen, electricity and reducing carbon emissions. The flexible carbon emission mechanism would not only satisfy the carbon emissions constraints, but also increase the whole profit of the VPP compared with the independent carbon emission mechanism. In order to deal with the uncertainty of wind power output and electricity market price, the scheduling strategy of the VPP is more conservative and less economical since robust optimization maximizes operational benefits in the worst case scenario. Nevertheless, it has stronger robustness and the ability to resist the fluctuation of the market price. The buying and selling behaviors and adjustable loads of VPP are affected by the uncertainty of electricity price. Based on the simulation analysis of deterministic scenarios and uncertain scenarios, the proposed flexible carbon emission mechanism can significantly improve the operating profit of the VPP.

AB The energy price uncertainty in energy markets is the main challenge for achieving economic modeling of energy consumption and generation. This paper proposes optimal energy scheduling in a smart energy hub (SEH) under the uncertainty of electricity prices in the day-ahead. The proposed optimization approach is implemented by a two-layer interval approach for minimizing energy generation cost. In first layer optimization, demand side management (DSM) for electrical demand subject to the optimal level of electrical consumption is implemented. In second-layer optimization, the interval approach is used for modeling uncertainty. The energy generation cost is converted to bi-objective functions including average and deviation costs with conflicting nature than each other. Also, the multi-performance of the hydrogen storage system based on electrical and natural gas generation is considered for managing uncertainties in second layer optimization. Since the interval optimization approach is proposed in the second layer, minimizing the average cost and deviation cost are formulated as bi-objective functions by the augmented epsilon-constraint method. In the following, the LINMAP procedure is utilized to achieve maximum compatibility and the best trade-off consequence in the Pareto frontier of the multi-objective functions. Finally, the proposed optimization approach is modeled as a numerical simulation in the case studies to verify obtained results. The participation of the DSM and the hydrogen storage systems leads to minimizing the average and deviation costs by 3.03 % and 3.16 % in comparison with non-participation.

AB Hydrogen-based regional multi-energy system (RMES) formed by uniting multiple integrated energy systems (IESs) in the region and combining the hydrogen energy industry chain is conducive to promoting a clean and low-carbon energy transition. However, the new characteristics of hydrogen-based RMES, such as multiple energy flows, multiple time scales, and multiple spatial scales, increase the difficulty of low-cost planning and flexible operation. Therefore, a novel multi-time-space scale optimization framework is proposed for the hydrogen-based RMES. Firstly, a hydrogen-based RMES is constructed, with electricity and hydrogen shared between communities, and the cooling, heating, electricity and hydrogen supply and demand balance of the system is modeled. Then, a four-phase multi-time-space scale optimization framework is proposed. The first and second phases are co-optimized to determine system configuration and day-ahead hourly operation scheme for the region to minimize both total annual cost and daily operation cost. Intra-day operation scheme for each community with 15 min time interval is obtained through moving-horizon optimization method in the third phase. In the fourth phase, with the objective of minimizing the amount of adjustment, the operation scheme of the electricity-related equipment with 5 min time interval in each community is optimally obtained. Finally, a case study is conducted with a region consisting of industrial, residential, and commercial community. The results show that, compared to the isolated IES, the total annual cost, annual carbon emissions, and total grid interactions of the hydrogen-based RMES are reduced by 3.4 k$ (0.9%), 1309.9 t (9.4%), and 1365.1 MWh (9.2%), respectively. In addition, the operation scheme obtained can flexibly coordinate various types of

AB The presence of distributed energy sources in integrated energy systems make it difficult to meet the real-time balance between supply and demand, requiring the deployment of energy storage systems. Hydrogen storage can compensate for the lack of electrochemical energy storage in the energy, time and space dimensions. Meanwhile, the cooperative operation of participants within an integrated energy system, compared to individual operation, can help generate additional benefits and reduce carbon emissions. Therefore, this paper proposes a method for optimising the operation of integrated energy systems based on a cooperative game containing hydrogen energy storage systems. Firstly, a model for optimising the operation of an integrated energy system with hydrogen storage energy system considering the revenue from hydrogen sales is constructed. Secondly, a benefit allocation mechanism for the cooperative game based on the shapley value method is proposed. Finally, the BPSO-SA optimisation algorithm is proposed for solution. The total operating cost of the collaborative operation scenario is reduced by 22.96% and the carbon emissions are reduced by 80.11% compared to the independent operation scenario, the operating cost savings and carbon emissions reduction are allocated to the participants according to their contribution, encourage participants to build integrated energy systems through collaboration.

AB With the widespread integration of renewable energy sources into IES (Integrated Energy Systems), the uncertainties in renewable energy outputs and the volatility of user loads present new challenges for energy scheduling optimization. To effectively address these uncertainties, this paper proposes a scheduling method for IES based on an enhanced DM (Diffusion Models). Firstly, a mathematical model of a regional IES encompassing energy supply devices, energy coupling devices, and energy storage devices is constructed. Secondly, an enhanced DM optimized with a VAE (Variational Autoencoder) is developed. By efficiently generating data in the latent space, this model enhances the representation capability of uncertainty factors, enabling precise modeling of fluctuations in wind and solar power outputs as well as heating, cooling, and electrical loads. Finally, leveraging the improved DM, a large number of high-quality error scenarios are generated, and scheduling optimization experiments are designed with the objectives of minimizing economic costs and carbon emissions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves more efficient energy distribution and lower carbon emissions but also maintains the continuous and stable operation of the system when faced with uncertainties such as renewable energy generation fluctuations and changes in load demand.

AB To achieve the goal of carbon neutrality,effectively managing load fluctuations while controlling total carbon emissions presents a significant challenge for the new power system. This study addresses issues such as carbon reduction and efficiency enhancement, improving the integration of clean energy, and reducing energy costs for enterprise clusters integrated energy systems. We innovatively combine Dynamic Green Certificate Trading (GCT), Carbon Emission Trading (CET) mechanisms, and Integrated Demand Response (IDR) to propose a multi- energy complementarity optimization scheduling method that considers the GCT-CET mechanisms and IDR. First, we establish an optimization model for an integrated energy system that accounts for the coupling of electricity, gas, heat, and cold, with the goal of minimizing system operational costs, carbon emissions, and green certificate trading costs. Based on optimizing the energy supply side's outputs, we utilize energy conversion devices to enhance multi-energy complementary capabilities. On the demand side, we develop an integrated demand response model to smooth load curves. By introducing demand-side integrated energy response and the carbon emission trading (CET) mechanism, we aim to achieve carbon reduction and peak shaving, resulting in a significant carbon reduction effect of 21.6 %, with peak-to-valley differences in electricity, heat, and cold loads reduced by 23.47%, 23.47%, and 20.99%, respectively. Additionally, we incorporate a dynamic green certificate trading mechanism to explore its impact on carbon emissions and the integrated energy supply structure. The results demonstrate that the optimization model for enterprise clusters' integrated energy systems, which considers the GCT-CET mechanisms and IDR, effectively enhances the economic efficiency of the system, providing important insights for the sustainable development and environmental protection of future energy systems.

AB The coordination of distributed energy resources (DERs) within virtual power plants (VPPs) is expected to generate significant economic benefits and enhance the operational stability of modern power systems. However, achieving massive coordination of heterogeneous and uncertain DERs remains a challenge in current research. To address this issue, this article proposes a novel bi-level optimization approach based on mean-field reinforcement learning (MFRL) to enable the coordination of massive DERs in VPPs. The problem is decomposed into multiple subproblems: the upper-level subproblem models power dispatch among integrated energy systems (IESs) in response to coordinated demand, while a series of lower-level subproblems determine the operational schemes of DERs within individual IESs. Considering the large decision space, an MFRL algorithm with fast Shapley credit allocation is developed to efficiently solve the upper-level optimization. Meanwhile, the lower-level subproblems are formulated as small-scale mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems, addressing the difficulties caused by IES heterogeneity in applying mean-field approximation. Simulation results show that the proposed approach significantly improves convergence speed and reduces the global cost of VPP operation, especially in massive-scale scenarios. In test scenarios ranging from 10 to 500 agents, the proposed bi-level optimization approach improves the objective by 4.8%-26.6%, compared to the advanced baseline method.

AB An interconnected energy hubs (EHs) framework aims to enhance the efficiency of the multicarrier energy system through realizing optimal coordination among existing players. In this paper, EH concept is studied in networked microgrids (MGs) structure to exploit the potential capabilities of microgrids in satisfying various types of energy demands. In the proposed model, MGs and distribution network are independent entities which have their local scheduling problem. To coordinate the operation of entities, a distributed algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is exploited to resolve the conflict of exchanged power between multi-MGs and distribution network. Considering the uncertainties, a distributed robust model is employed to precisely analyze the performance of multicarrier energy networked MGs in different robustness levels. The efficiency of the ADMM model on integrated energy systems is tested on a networked MGs. The achieved results can ensure the light computational burden and convergence of proposed distributed algorithm. The proposed EH optimization problem is solved via Gurobi optimizer packages. According to the results, the ADMM converges to the final solution after 5 iterations, and with increasing the robustness level, the operation costs of EHs increases. The obtained results by Gurobi is more optimal than heuristic algorithms. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, using integrated energy systems for residential-scale applications has been of great interest to the researchers. The objective of this study is the proposal, techno-economic analysis, and optimization of the best prime mover for the residential scale combined cooling, heating, and power generation system (CCHP). Different prime movers consisting of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), internal combustion engine (ICE), microgas turbine (MGT), and hybrid SOFC/GT system for power production are integrated with HRSG and double effect Li/Br refrigeration system for heating and cooling generation, respectively. A parametric study is conducted on the best case to find the key decision variables. Also, a very cutting-edge optimization, which is 3D multi-objective optimization, is carried out for minimizing the unit product cost and emission and maximizing the exergetic efficiency. Results revealed that the hybrid SOFC/GT has higher exergy efficiency of 69.06% and unit product cost of 37.78 $ GJ(-1), among other case studies. Also, optimization results indicate a maximum exergy efficiency of 73.15%, and a minimum cost of 25.08 ($ GJ(-1)) can be reached for the SOFC-/GT-based CCHP system. Moreover, the optimized emission for the best-case scenario becomes 62.52 g MWh(-1).

ID ALGORITHM; DESIGN
AB With rapidly developing new energy technologies, rational energy planning has become an important area of research. Ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) have shown themselves to be highly efficient. effective in reducing building or district energy consumption and operating costs. However, when optimizing integrated energy systems, most studies simplify the GSHP model by using the rated coefficient of performance (COP) of the GSHP unit, neglecting factors such as soil, buried piping, and actual operating conditions. This simplification leads to a deviation from the actual operation of GSHPs, creating a gap between the derived operational guidelines and real-world performance. Therefore, this paper examines a hotel equipped with photovoltaic panels, a GSHP, and a hybrid energy storage unit. By constructing models of the underground pipes, GSHP units, and pumps, this paper considers the thermal exchanger between the underground pipes and the soil, the thermal pump, and the operating status of the unit. The purpose is to optimize the running expenses using an enhanced mote swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to calculate the optimal operating strategy of system equipment. Compared to the simplified energy system optimization model, the detailed GSHP unit model shows a 21.36% increase in energy consumption, a 13.64% decrease in the mean COP of the GSHP unit, and a 44.4% rise in system running expenses. The differences in the GSHP model affect the energy consumption results of the unit by changing the relationship between the power consumption of the PV system and the GSHP at different times, which in turn affects the operation of the energy storage unit. The final discussion highlights significant differences in the calculated system operating results derived from the two models, suggesting that these may profoundly affect the architectural and enhancement processes of more complex GSHP configurations.

DE Stationary-mobile energy storage systems; Lyapunov optimization;
   Spatial-temporal optimization strategies; Flexibility evaluation
   framework; Integrated energy systems
AB With the severe issues of spatial-temporal renewable energy (RE) consumption in integrated energy systems (IES), stationary-mobile energy storage systems (SMESS) have emerged as a promising paradigm. Specifically, stationary energy storage systems (SESS) participate in load flexible adjustment while mobile energy storage systems (MESS) realize spatial power shifting. To achieve the spatial-temporal power balance of regional IES, the control strategy of SMESS is proposed. The use of SMESS control strategy has greatly promoted the spatialtemporal RE consumption of IES. The MESS strategy gives four conditions to determine the charging and discharging power by comprehensively assessing the RE levels in both the departure and destination regions. Meanwhile, the SESS strategy efficiently performs peak shifting and valley filling for load management in the IES. The combined use of SESS and MESS demonstrates the complementary nature of energy storage across both time and space. Then, to solve the proposed spatial-temporal coupled SMESS problem, an improved Lyapunov optimization approach is leveraged, which minimizes the weighted sum of drift function and operation costs, and the constraint range of the weighting factor is improved to address the issue of local optimality in the optimization results caused by the unconstrained weighting factor. Afterward, the flexibility evaluation framework is introduced to quantify the flexibility of IES with SMESS scheduling. This method is tested under the Shanghai IES case, the results exhibit that the consumption of renewable energy is elevated, the costs of scheduling in IES are alleviated, and the flexibility of regional IES is enhanced.

AB The transition to low-carbon energy systems requires innovative solutions to address renewable energy variability, demand-side uncertainty, and user engagement. Integrated Energy Systems (IES) link electricity, gas, and heat to improve grid flexibility and renewable integration. This paper presents a novel framework for optimizing community energy management in IES, incorporating behavioral insights, advanced optimization, and gamification. Using Self-Determination Theory (SDT) to model user motivations, the framework integrates a differentiable Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) layer for uncertainty handling in energy forecasting. Gamification strategies incentivize user participation, aligning individual behavior with system goals. A multi-objective model minimizes costs, enhances flexibility, and promotes sustainability. A case study demonstrates that the framework reduces system costs approximately by 15%, cuts carbon emissions nearly by 20%, and increases user engagement scores roughly by 25% compared to conventional strategies. This work contributes: (1) integrating SDT and DRO for energy management, (2) a DRO layer for robust machine learning, (3) a multi-objective optimization framework, and (4) gamification strategies to enhance user participation. The framework bridges technical and behavioral approaches, offering actionable insights for resilient energy systems.

AB This study proposes a partition optimization design method that combines K-means and genetic algorithm (GA) for regional integrated energy systems (IESs) composed of complex loads. Building partitions are obtained by a multi-energy unified clustering model based on a K-means algorithm and performed for the electrical, heating, cooling, and gas loads of various buildings. The availability of all types of resources is evaluated by clustering the local resource data. According to the unified analysis of characteristics such as the thermoelectric ratio of loads and availability of resources, suitable energy supply equipment are selected to form an alternative structure set. Capacity configuration optimization models are established based on energy, economy, and environmental evaluation indicators considering the off design performance of the equipment. The GA is used to optimize the configuration of each alternative structure for every partition. The system evaluation indicators are sorted by the linear weighting method to obtain an optimal system configuration suitable for each building partition. A case study is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The energy supply effect of the system designed for each partition is significantly improved compared with that of a separated production system. The proposed method has engineering significance for guiding the construction of regional IESs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With various social capital gradually into the electric power market, different virtual power plants will belong to different interest subjects in the future. The main development direction of China's energy market is to build a regional comprehensive energy market with multi-agent participation. Because the traditional power grid electricity price adopts monopoly transaction mode, the market enthusiasm is not high. In view of the situation, this paper proposes a two-level optimization model of master-slave game based on dynamic pricing. In order to encourage electric energy transactions between distribution network operators and multiple virtual power plants, distribution network operator solves the internal optimal electricity price according to the price response of virtual power plants in the optimization process. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy can promote energy sharing among integrated energy systems.

AB For integrated energy systems (IES) composed of a set of energy hubs (EHs), a consensus control method is usually adopted to achieve accurate sharing of electrical and thermal composite energies. To solve the communication redundancy problem of the consensus control method, a hierarchical optimization and distributed control scheme based on a dynamic event-triggered mechanism of EHs is proposed to realize stable operation of IES. An economic optimization strategy based on equal increment principle is improved to minimize the operation costs of IES in the second layer. Due to consensus control being integrated into the supply-demand power deviation calculations of EHs, the desired electrical and thermal power trajectories are accurately determined. To improve dynamic response performances in the presence of uncertain disturbances, an event-triggered communication mechanism is designed in the primary layer. The triggering threshold can be adjusted dynamically according to changes of electrical and thermal power outputs, and the redundant communication requirement in the electrical branches is reduced. Considering the coupling characteristics of IES energy networks, a consensus control method is promoted to synchronously track the desired electric and thermal power trajectories of EHs, and the goal of accurate power sharing is achieved. The frequency and pipeline pressure fluctuations are also limited within the allowable range. The economic optimization and coordinated operation of electrical and thermal composite energies in IES are guaranteed by the proposed hierarchical control structure. Additionally, only information from neighboring EHs at the event-triggered time is involved, so the computation simplicity and control performance can be obtained simultaneously. The hardware-in-loop experimental results are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

AB The operating multi-carrier integrated energy systems (MIESs) at the building level face challenges from multiple deep uncertainties related to resources, demands, and market prices. These uncertainties complicate decisionmaking and affect system reliability, cost-efficiency, and sustainability. Tackling these challenges requires advanced optimization models capable of handling many simultaneous uncertainties. This study addresses this need by developing a bi-level, many-objective stochastic optimization model. The upper-level optimization applies information-gap decision theory to evaluate risk-averse and risk-seeking decision policies, ensuring the system's adaptability under many uncertain parameters. This level uses a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III to solve the many-objective optimization problem, generating a many-dimensional Pareto efficient solution set. It then utilizes a hybrid decision-making tool that combines the fuzzy satisfying method with a conservative approach to select the final optimal solution from this set. The lower-level optimization formulates a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem to minimize the costs of energy, emissions, and multi-carrier energy not supplied while maintaining technical constraints. The model validates its effectiveness across diverse real-world urban settings, including hospital and industrial applications, demonstrating its ability to generate robust operational strategies for MIESs. The results confirm that the proposed model outperforms conventional methods by providing efficient operational strategies for MIESs under uncertainties.

AB Buildings produce a significant share of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, making homes and businesses a major factor in climate change. To address this critical challenge, this paper explores achieving net-zero emission through the carbon-aware optimal scheduling of the multi-energy building integrated energy systems (BIES). We integrate advanced technologies and strategies, such as the carbon capture system (CCS), power-to-gas (P2G), carbon tracking, and emission allowance trading, into the traditional BIES scheduling problem. The proposed model enables accurate accounting of carbon emissions associated with building energy systems and facilitates the implementation of low-carbon operations. Furthermore, to address the challenge of accurately assessing uncertainty sets related to forecasting errors of loads, generation, and carbon intensity, we develop a learning-based robust optimization approach for BIES that is robust in the presence of uncertainty and guarantees statistical feasibility. The proposed approach comprises a shape learning stage and a shape calibration stage to generate an optimal uncertainty set that ensures favorable results from a statistical perspective. Numerical studies conducted based on both synthetic and real-world datasets have demonstrated that the approach yields up to 8.2% cost reduction, compared with conventional methods, in assisting buildings to robustly reach net-zero emissions.

AB The building sector accounts for the largest portion of total final energy consumption in most countries, and is responsible for around one third of carbon emissions, which have been regarded as the cause for global warming and climate changes. District energy network, which can supply consumers with heating/cooling and electricity, is an effective and proven approach to enhance energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. Currently, the approach of integrated energy systems (including renewable energy) tends to be increasingly necessary and significant for the district energy network. This article presents a comprehensive review of energy performance of district energy networks, focusing on optimization and evaluation of district heating network combining with other relevant energy systems and renewable technologies. This review consists of the concept of district energy network, typical applications of district energy network, and significant literatures of energy performance of various energy networks based on theoretical modelling and analysis, physical experimental studies and numerical simulations. Furthermore, over 30 factors affecting energy performance have been substantially investigated and assessed. This review has demonstrated that main effects on energy network performance are significantly linked to configurations and capacities of system, climate conditions (locations and time), and the interaction between various factors. An optimal overall performance of district energy network would need to integrate several advanced energy systems, e.g. a balanced energy network.

AB Operational optimization plays a vital role in ensuring the economy, security, and environmental friendliness of integrated energy systems (IES), while the nonlinear operating characteristics of energy converters have brought significant challenges to the accurate modeling and solution. Considering the nonlinear energy conversion processes, a novel adaptive piecewise linearized weighted directed graph model of IES is proposed in this paper. To accurately construct the complex energy flow relationship in IES, a weighted directed graph is first presented to describe the energy generation, conversion, storage, consumption, and demand response, thus realizing the automatic modeling of IES. On this basis, for the diverse partial-load performance of energy converters, an adaptive piecewise linearization strategy is developed to approximate the nonlinear operating characteristics of various energy converters adaptively. By taking the system operating cost, calculation time, energy mismatch, and optimization model complexity as evaluation indicators, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the numerical simulations of a typical small-scale combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) system and a large-scale IES in a realistic industrial park. Compared with the constant efficiency method and the equispaced piecewise linearization method, the computational efficiency and accuracy are remarkably improved by the proposed method.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Day-ahead dispatch optimization, as an essential dynamic function required for the optimum energy management of integrated energy systems, is suffered from the curse of dimensionality and high computational cost when it faces with nonlinear, non-convex, and in particular high-dimensional situations. The critical one factor contributing to these phenomena is the dynamic constraints which are coupled in a time-series way. To this end, a new search strategy is proposed in this paper to handle the time-series constraints in harmony search (HS) based day-ahead dispatch problems, called as conductor harmony search (CHS). The CHS introduces a state matrix to record the values of time-series constraints. Moreover, when the variable values at a certain moment are altered during the improvement process, the variables at the coming moment are modulated to enable the corresponding values in state matrix remain unaffected. In contrast to existing constraint handling methods, the CHS guarantees the least impact on the dynamic boundaries of feasible regions in the remaining moments. Simulations reveal that the proposed CHS is effective and powerful to solve the day-ahead dispatch problem by comparing with some existing algorithms. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As global climate change and energy crises intensify, the pursuit of low-carbon integrated energy systems (IESs) has become increasingly important. This paper proposes an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) designed to optimize the multi-objective low-carbon operations of IESs, aiming to minimize both operating costs and carbon emissions. The IGA incorporates circular crossover and polynomial mutation techniques, which not only preserve advantageous traits from the parent population but also enhance genetic diversity, enabling comprehensive exploration of potential solutions. Additionally, the algorithm selects parent populations based on individual fitness and dominance, retaining successful chromosomes and eliminating those that violate constraints. This process ensures that subsequent generations inherit superior genetic traits while minimizing constraint violations, thereby enhancing the feasibility of the solutions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we tested it on three different IES scenarios. The results demonstrate that the IGA successfully reduces equality constraint violations to below 0.3 kW, representing less than 0.2% deviation from the IES's power demand in each time slot. We compared its performance against a multi-objective genetic algorithm, a multi-objective particle swarm algorithm, and a single-objective genetic algorithm. Compared to conventional genetic algorithms, the IGA achieved maximum 5% improvement in both operational cost reduction and carbon emission minimization objectives compared to the unimproved single-objective genetic algorithm, demonstrating its superior performance in multi-objective optimization for low-carbon IESs. These outcomes underscore the algorithm's reliability and practical applicability.

AB In order to achieve digital and intelligent upgrading of traditional industrial parks, and support high-quality regional development and renewable energy consumption, there is an urgent need for intelligent scheduling models in parks. This paper combines the smart park management system and the physical model of the parklevel integrated energy system to establish a cluster architecture, and a three-stage collaborative operation method for green power trading in park-level integrated energy system cluster is proposed to solve the problem of green power trading in multi park integrated energy systems, achieving accurate prediction and on-site consumption of distributed green power. Firstly, based on the big language model LLAMA-7B, green power prediction is implemented, and further the purchase and sale types of power parks are divided by green power. Secondly, based on the green electricity price quota curve prediction model and dynamic green electricity pricing strategy, the differential prices for green electricity transactions between parks are formulated. On this basis, a multi-objective low-carbon economic optimization operation model is established to solve the contradiction between economic and environmental factors brought by green electricity exchanges. The case analysis shows that compared with the three scenarios of no green electricity-fixed carbon price-park operation alone, no green electricity-tiered carbon trading-park operation alone, and fixed green electricity price-tiered carbon trading- park cluster operation, the comprehensive cost of the green electricity dynamic pricing-tiered carbon trading- park cluster operation scenario proposed in this paper decreased by 24.76 %, 24.28 %, and 0.97 %, respectively; Compared with single objective optimization, the multi-objective optimization model proposed in this paper can comprehensively plan the economic cost, actual carbon emissions, and new energy utilization rate of the park-level integrated energy system cluster, and has a positive promoting effect on the intelligent scheduling of multi park integrated energy systems.

AB The present research conducts a comparative analysis and techno-economic optimization of three novel integrated energy systems for producing hydrogen, power, and desalinated water. These systems consist of heliostat field collectors, photovoltaic panels, a Rankine cycle, an organic Rankine cycle (ORC), and multi-effects water desalination systems. The main difference between the three proposed systems is the electrolyzer type. Three electrolyzer types are utilized: solid oxide electrolyzer cell (SOEC), polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer (PEM), and alkaline electrolyzer. This research aims to compare these three types of electrolyzers in an integrated system to analyze their performance from both exergy and economic viewpoint at their optimum conditions. Parametric studies on system exergy efficiency and hydrogen production rate were also conducted. The results demonstrate that in the exergy-economic optimum conditions, the exergy efficiency of the combined solid oxide system, polymer exchange membrane system, and Alkaline system are 13.15%, 13.04%, and 12.41%, respectively. As SOEC works at high temperatures, both thermal and electrical energy cooperate to produce hydrogen. Therefore, the maximum hydrogen production rate and system exergy efficiency happen in the integrated SOEC system. Although the SOEC system has the most significant cost rate of 0.9372 $/s, the most expensive hydrogen cost belongs to the PEM system with a charge of 3.54 $/kg, and the cheapest one is produced in the alkaline system at 2.94 $/kg.

AB Predictive-based decision optimization methods have gained traction in integrated energy system operations, particularly when historical source-load data is accessible and uncertainties exist. However, these methods typically isolate prediction from optimization, ignoring current impacts on future states and prioritizing economic benefits, causing load fluctuations and supply volatility that restrict real-time decision-making. To address this challenge, this study proposes a real-time optimization method utilizing online model predictive control (MPC) for a system integrating electricity, thermal energy, hydrogen, and gas. A novel evaluation framework is developed to balance economic benefits with operational stability, accompanied by a dynamic adjustment strategy for control and prediction horizons. Case studies demonstrate the outstanding performance of the online MPC method and illustrate the differences from traditional predictive-based methods. Specifically, our method increases economic benefits by 2.96 %. Under renewable energy disturbances, the proposed method improves energy supply reliability by 6.58 % and 7.76 % compared to traditional methods #1 and #2, respectively. The study underscores how multi-energy and multi-market interactions affect benefits, with halting hydrogen conversion reducing economic gains by 0.61 % and stopping electric vehicle discharging cutting them by 15.97 %. The results highlight the method's effective balance between economy and stability in dynamic supply-demand scenarios, which is promising for system optimization.

AB The exponential growth in demand for computing power has resulted in a rapid expansion of energy consumption and CO2 emissions from data centers. Consequently, the full utilization of renewable energy sources is regarded as the most effective strategy for data centers to achieve near-zero carbon emissions. However, due to the mismatch between the intermittency of renewable energy and the time-varying workloads. Data centers still face challenges in integrating renewable energy and exploiting the regulation potential of computing tasks. Therefore, this study proposes a novel multi-featured collaborative optimization framework for low-carbon data center integrated energy systems (DCIES) that integrates task scheduling mechanism, renewable energy uncertainty and hybrid cooling. Firstly, the renewable energy scenario generation is based on the generative adversarial network with gradient penalty. The two-stage distributionally robust optimization model for DCIES based on data-driven uncertainty set is established to address the renewable energy uncertainty. Secondly, this study exploits the flexibility regulation potential of data center by formulating the workload scheduling mechanism for multiple tasks with different server execution times and delay-tolerant times. The results reveal that the DCIES collaborative optimization scheme, which integrates the task scheduling mechanism, renewable energy uncertainty and hybrid cooling, could reduce the total cost and CO2 emissions by 23.2 % and 28.4 %, respectively, while reducing the renewable energy curtailment by 7.4 %. This multi-featured collaborative optimization of data center computing electricity and thermal provides a novel approach to the low-carbon and sustainable development of data center buildings.

AB Decarbonization efforts across North America, Europe, and beyond rely on variable renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, as well as alternative fuels, such as hydrogen, to support the sustainable energy transition. These advancements have prompted a need for more flexibility in the electric grid to complement non-dispatchable energy sources and increased demand from electrification. Integrated energy systems are well suited to provide this flexibility, but conventional technoeconomic modeling paradigms neglect the time-varying dynamic nature of the grid and thus undervalue resource flexibility. In this work, we develop a computational optimization framework for dynamic market-based technoeconomic comparison of integrated energy systems that coproduce low-carbon electricity and hydrogen (e.g., solid oxide fuel cells, solid oxide electrolysis) against technologies that only produce electricity (e.g., natural gas combined cycle with carbon capture) or only produce hydrogen. Our framework starts with rigorous physics-based process models, built in the open-source Institute for the Design of Advanced Energy Systems (IDAES) modeling and optimization platform, for six energy process concepts. Using these rigorous models and a workflow to optimally design each technology, the framework is shown to be capable of evaluating new and emerging technologies in varying energy markets under a plethora of future scenarios (i.e., renewables penetration, carbon tax, etc.). Ultimately, our framework finds that solid oxide fuel cell-based coproduction systems achieve positive profits for 85% of the analyzed market scenarios. From these market optimization results, we use multivariate linear regression (R2 values up to 0.99) to determine which electricity price statistics are most significant to predict the optimized annual profit of each system. The proposed framework provides a powerful tool for directly comparing flexible, multi-product energy process concepts to help discern optimal technology and integration options.

AB To improve the economic efficiency of urban integrated energy systems (UIESs) and mitigate day-ahead dispatch uncertainty, this paper presents an interconnected UIES and transmission system (TS) model based on distributed robust optimization. First, interconnections are established between a TS and multiple UIESs, as well as among different UIESs, each incorporating multiple energy forms. The Bregman alternating direction method with multipliers (BADMM) is then applied to multi-block problems, ensuring the privacy of each energy system operator (ESO). Second, robust optimization based on wind probability distribution information is implemented for each ESO to address dispatch uncertainty. The column and constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm is then employed to solve the robust model. Third, to tackle the convergence and practicability issues overlooked in the existing studies, an external C&CG with an internal BADMM and corresponding acceleration strategy is devised. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the adoption of the proposed model and method for absorbing wind power and managing its uncertainty results in economic benefits.

AB In this paper, an equilibrium -heuristic online prediction optimization approach is proposed for multi -market peer -to -peer (P2P) electricity-hydrogen trading of integrated energy systems (IESs) with uncertainties. First, the IES, consisting of a hydrogen energy storage subsystem and a combined cooling, heating, and power subsystem, is constructed in the distribution network to improve energy utilization and market efficiency. Then, a bi-level optimization model for IESs, participating in the P2P electricity-hydrogen energy trading, the real-time electricity, and the ancillary service markets, is proposed, in which the top-level model can be formulated as a P2P electricity-hydrogen trading pricing model through the social welfare maximization problem, and the lower -level model is used to maximize the IES operating profit. To effectively solve the bi-level model, the game equilibrium -based ADMM distributed algorithm is used to obtain the P2P trading volume and prices of the top-level model, and a new hybrid heuristic algorithm, called hybrid sand cat swarm optimization and improved honey badger algorithm (SCIHB), is proposed to solve the lower level model. SCIHB utilizes a hybrid mechanism and an adaptive learning rate parameter to balance local exploitation and global exploration. Furthermore, a new online learning probabilistic prediction method based on the hidden Markov model and wavelet transform is introduced to describe the uncertainties of wind power, electricity prices, and frequency regulation prices. Finally, case studies are conducted on an IEEE 33 -bus test system, and the numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed P2P trading model and solution approach.

AB Integrated Energy Systems (IES) play a pivotal role in achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals. However, previous research in IES operation has mainly focused on energy flow constraints, neglecting the impacts of renewable energy output, energy prices, carbon emission, and storage status. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a Comprehensive Self-Adaptive (CSA) operation strategy as a key component of our two-tier synergistic optimization method, optimizing an IES integrated with Concentrated Photovoltaic/Thermal systems. In the upper-tier capacity configuration, the proposed method considers the full life-cycle carbon emissions of equipment. In the lower-tier operational strategy optimization, the CSA operation strategy automatically adjusts energy generation, utilization, and storage by comprehensively evaluating hourly operating costs, hourly carbon emissions, and hourly storage benefits. Compared to traditional operation strategies and other adaptive methods, the newly developed strategy consistently demonstrates superior performance. When contrasted with separate energy systems, IES operating under the CSA operation strategy markedly stands out, achieving a cost savings rate of 25.87 %, a CO2 reduction rate of 61.54 %, and an electricity matching ratio of 91.24 %. Additionally, the paper explores the performance of the CSA operation strategy across various regions, confirming its feasibility and generalizability under diverse load and irradiance conditions.

AB The development of heat and power generation systems has a major step towards sustainable development, reducing fossil energy consumption and reducing environmental pollution. Integrated energy systems are considered widely due to their high efficiency. In the present paper, an intercooled gas turbine system is developed to achieve a system with high thermal efficiency as well as better economic performance and cleaner production. The main goals of the suggested system is improvement of thermodynamic and exergo-economic performance beside multi-criteria optimization, which lead to improve the system sustainability. The intercooled gas turbine in the current work integrated with hot water system and thermoelectric generator unit to develop an advanced combined heat and power system. A comprehensive energy, exergy, and exergo-economic analyses are employed to price assessment of the new introduced system. A comparative analysis with conventional intercooled gas turbine system is presented. The results of thermodynamic modeling indicate that an improvement about 613.3 kW, 8.21 kW, and 12.3 kW can be obtained in the gas turbine, Kalina cycle, and regenerative organic Rankine cycle subsystems. The results of energy and exergy analysis show that the values of both energy and exergy efficiencies for all subsystems experience increment in the new introduced. Parametric analysis based on thermodynamic and exergo-economic criteria is done and a triple objective optimization conducted to determine the best system configurations. The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution is employed to choose the final optimal state of the system. The result of optimum selection among non-dominant solutions suggested by Pareto points indicates that the energy efficiency, total exergy destruction rate and electricity cost rate are 53.91%, 2392.01 kW, and 52.29 $/h.

AB Significant growth in gas-fired combined heat and power units worldwide has enhanced the degree of interdependency between power, natural gas and district heating systems. This study establishes a bi-level optimization model for integrated energy systems that handles the interaction between centralized energy generation and the heating costs of end users in winter. The upper level of the model is designed to maximize the total benefit of the integrated energy system, and the lower level is designed to minimize the heating bills of residents. The lower level considers the thermal inertia of the building and the thermal comfort of the inhabitants. The indoor temperature demand is converted to a heat demand within a feasible interval. The nonlinear bi-level model is transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming formulation using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality condition. The optimal results of the traditional and proposed models are compared in case studies. The impacts of three representative auxiliary equipments (power to gas, electric boiler and gas tank) on wind power integration or gas generation cost are also investigated.

AB With the development of energy conversion technologies such as combined heat and power and gas power generation, various forms of energy, such as the electricity, gas, and heat of regional integrated energy systems have become highly coupled. Aiming at regional electricity-gas systems (REGS), this paper focuses on the interaction between an electricity power system and a natural gas system. A comprehensive analytical model of the REGS combined with distributed gas injection is proposed, where a regional energy station (RES) is considered as an energy coupling link. The REGS's energy flow is optimized to minimize the operation cost of the RES by comprehensively considering the cost of distributed gas injection, the penalty of wind curtailment, and the constraints of the energy network. Furthermore, multiple RESs and distributed gas injections are used as a control to study the effects of various adjustable resources on the economics of REGS' operating costs, flexibility of renewable energy consumption, and safety of pressure support capabilities. Subsequently, a system optimization scheduling strategy without considering gas injection point and the corresponding strategy considering hydrogen or upgraded biogas as gas injection temperament are studied. Numerical example shows that with the introduction of distributed gas injection points, the economic dispatch strategy considering the upgrade of biogas and hydrogen injection improved the economic, pressure reduction level, and wind power consumption rate of the system, which are important for improving the stability and flexibility of REGSs.

AB The optimized operation of integrated energy systems (IES) is of great significance to reduce carbon emissions and improve the overall efficiency of the system, at present, IES planning lacks comprehensive planning. As a response, in this paper, a grid-connected IES is proposed, which considers the complementarity of geothermal energy and solar energy and takes heat storage into account. The multi-objective optimization problem of IES is studied for the coupling mode of electric energy, heat energy and cold energy. Taking a multi-functional park as the research object, a multi-objective optimization model was established aiming at integrating operation cost, exergic efficiency and pollution gas emission penalty cost. MO-NSGA-II algorithm was proposed to solve the optimization model, and it was compared with MOI-PSO algorithm and MO-WA algorithm. The results show that MO-NSGA-II algorithm has stronger convergence, pareto solution set is obviously better than the other two optimization algorithms, and the solution set has better continuity and uniformity. Secondly, the comparison between IES and the traditional energy supply system proved the superiority of IES in multi-objective. The cost saving rate of IES was up to 57.3%, exergic efficiency was improved 39.5% and pollution emissions were reduced 54.8%. It also proved again that MO-NSGA-II algorithm had a good effect on solving the IES model in this paper. Then, we analyzed the cold, hot and electric energy hub scheduling diagram of the three algorithms and found that MO-NSGA-II algorithm had better self-regulation ability, and the coordinated output ratio of gas turbine and power grid was a key factor affecting the overall economic and environmental benefits of IES, which was strongly correlated with the operation strategy of the system. These results can provide reference for the optimization of integrated energy system and further tap the development potential of multi-energy system.

AB Due to the challenges associated with grid management, it is crucial to develop energy management systems that consider optimal resource performance within an integrated system and enable control of power exchange with the grid. Simultaneously, addressing the demand for multiple energy sources is a critical step towards achieving an economically and efficiently integrated energy system (IES), which plays a pivotal role in promoting sustainable IES development. Building upon these considerations, this article proposes a two-objective optimization model that incorporates the concept of demand response and integrated energy systems, while considering comprehensive economic and energy efficiency benefits. To ensure realism, a range of linear and nonlinear constraints are employed. To address such a problem, a two-stage modeling and solution approach is proposed. Initially, flexible electrical and thermal loads are combined to establish a mechanism for effectively responding to system behavior. Subsequently, a multi-objective model is presented to enhance energy generation and transfer efficiency, taking into account both demand response and economic aspects. Given the distinct properties of these objectives, a multi-objective grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) is developed. The Pareto concept is utilized to enhance search performance, and fuzzy theory is employed to select the optimal solution from the set of solutions. Finally, the proposed model and algorithm are evaluated under various operating conditions on the studied system. The results demonstrate that this model effectively improves economic aspects, enhances efficiency, and reduces pollutant emissions to an acceptable level.

AB With increasing distributed energy resource integration, future power and energy systems will be more decentralized using advanced Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. Integrated energy systems (IESs) boost the whole energy efficiency by coordinating multiregional energy resources and networks. However, distributed coordination of the IES requires different subregions or energy hubs (EHs) to share their sensitive information (e.g., energy demands and operation status) explicitly, which poses serious privacy leakage. To this end, secure multiparty computation (SMPC) is innovatively introduced to the distributed optimization of the IES in this article. First, the standardized modeling of multiple interconnected EHs with the linearized network models is formulated to analyze the IES's inherent energy and information interaction comprehensively. Then, a privacy-preserving distributed optimal energy flow algorithm is proposed by combining the Paillier Cryptosystem mechanism with the alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM). Theoretical analysis proves the proposed method is convergent without sharing sensitive information in plaintext. Numerical experiments on a three-subregions IES validate that the proposed method has better convergence performance than the differential privacy-based method. Results show that the maximum relative error of the distributed optimal solutions with various step sizes is no more than 0.072% compared with the centralized method.

AB Large-scale hydrogen production with wind power generation has been gaining increasing attention and applications. Achieving a good balance between the capacity and cost of wind power generation however remains as a critical challenge restricting the develop-ment of wind-hydrogen integrated energy systems (WHIES). In addition, the aging factor may come in over time, making negative impacts on the efficiency and cost of WHIES. In this work, a method is proposed to seek a good balance between the capacity and cost of WHIES. Specifically, by comparing operational data and equipment condition, we evaluate the aging status of the wind power generation system and the hydrogen production sys-tem, then the aging economic model of WHIES is proposed. By taking into account the actual operating conditions in constructing the WHIES objective function with the aging factor, the proposed model allows striving to maximize the production capacity with the minimum cost. An improved multi-objective gray wolf optimizer algorithm is developed to solve the WHIES cost optimization problem. Finally, case studies are carried out via MATLAB based on the configuration and experimental data fora specific wind farm located in Ningxia, China. Our results help achieve a balance between maximizing capacity and minimizing cost under various conditions. & COPY; 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Design optimization and granularity analysis of district heating systems

AB In the low-carbon transition process of district heating systems (DHS), the need for widespread access to renewable energy and lower carbon emissions conflict with the existing structure of large centralized DHS. This paper proposes an optimized design of the DHS based on granularity analysis methodology to harness distributed solar energy. This study applies a hierarchical clustering method to get the possible scheme set based on the given geometrical information of an area with distributed solar heating system (SHS). This study further carries out pipe network routings and the pipeline sizing optimization to implement the scheme with the best economic performance. To disclose the relationship between granularity and SHS access ratio, we propose a quantitative granularity estimation method considering the spatial distribution of heat in the sense of Manhattan distance. This study calculates optimal schemes' total annual cost (TAC) and potential operation instability (PRI) under a series of SHS access ratios. A real DHS covering a heating area of 164300 m2, and 21 buildings is selected for a case study. At a granularity of 4.50%, TAC is reduced by 16.04%, and PRI by 58.06% compared to the existing design where granularity is not considered and one substation covering the entire area. As the SHS access ratio increases from 0 to 12%, the optimal granularity value increases from 4.50% to 16.84%, indicating a higher granularity is necessary to utilize solar energy. Our work shows that a proper selection of granularity in the design stage is essential to the economic and stable operation of DHS with renewable energy access. The result from this study is also meaningful to the design and operation control of district energy systems and integrated energy systems.

ID FRAMEWORK; DEMAND
AB With the escalating dependence on electricity and natural gas infrastructure, ensuring both reliability and economic efficiency becomes paramount. It necessitates reliability centric measures to mitigate disruptions that could cascade between these interconnected systems. To address this challenges, this paper introduces a reliability-constrained two-stage stochastic model to optimize power-to-gas (P2 G) and gas-to-power (G2P) unit placement and sizing, aiming to enhance the reliability of both systems under stochastic scenarios. The proposed model, employing Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) within its optimization framework, seeks to minimize investment, operation, and reliability costs. By addressing temporal uncertainties in component outages for both systems and considering uncertainties in power and gas system loads with a high temporal resolution and annual load growth, the model provides a comprehensive reliability perspective. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is conducted to explore the impact of varying Values of Lost Load (VOLL) on the planning results. Numerical evaluation, using two integrated energy systems including IEEE 14-bus-10-gas node, and large-scale energy systems including IEEE 118-bus-85-gas node integrated power-gas system (IPGS), demonstrates a significant 12.53 % improvement in overall system reliability. Furthermore, a 2.81 % reduction in operation costs and a substantial 26.3 % reduction in reliability costs, validating the effectiveness of the proposed model.

UEHN have been expected to provide an effective way to accommodate the intermittent and unpredictable renewable energy sources, in which the application of stochastic optimization approaches to UEHN analysis is highly desired. In this paper, we propose a chance-constrained coordinated optimization approach for UEHN considering the uncertainties in electricity loads, heat loads, and photovoltaic outputs, as well as the correlations between these uncertain sources. A solution strategy, which combines the Latin Hypercube Sampling Monte Carlo Simulation (LHSMCS) approach and a heuristic algorithm, is specifically designed to deal with the proposed chance-constrained coordinated optimization. Finally, test results on an UEHN comprised of a modified IEEE 33-bus system and a 32-node district heating system at Barry Island have verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

AB This paper addresses the critical challenge of scheduling optimization in regional integrated energy systems, characterized by the coupling of multiple physical energy streams (electricity, heat, and cooling) and the participation of various stakeholders. To tackle this, a novel multi-load and multi-type integrated demand response model is proposed, which fully accounts for the heterogeneous characteristics of energy demands in different campus environments. A leader-follower two-layer game equilibrium model is introduced, where the system operator acts as the leader, and campus load aggregators, energy storage plants, and wind farm operators serve as followers. The layer employs an enhanced particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to iteratively adjust energy sales prices and response compensation unit prices, influencing the user response plan through the demand response model. In the lower layer, the charging and discharging schedules of energy storage plants, wind farm energy supply, and outputs of energy conversion devices are optimized to guide system operation. The novelty of this approach lies in the integration of a game-theoretic framework with advanced optimization techniques to balance the interests of all participants and enhance system coordination. A case study is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, demonstrating significant economic benefits. The results show that the model encourages stakeholders to invest in energy infrastructure and actively participate in coordinated dispatch, leading to improved overall system efficiency and comprehensive revenue enhancement for the multi-agent energy system.

AB An optimal energy scheduling strategy for integrated energy systems (IESs) can effectively improve the energy utilization efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. Due to the large-scale state space of IES caused by uncertain factors, it would be beneficial for the model training process to formulate a reasonable state-space representation. Thus, a condition knowledge representation and feedback learning framework based on contrastive reinforcement learning is designed in this study. Considering that different state conditions would bring inconsistent daily economic costs, a dynamic optimization model based on deterministic deep policy gradient is established, so that the condition samples can be partitioned according to the preoptimized daily costs. In order to represent the overall conditions on a daily basis and constrain the uncertain states in the IES environment, the state-space representation is constructed by a contrastive network considering the time dependence of variables. A Monte-Carlo policy gradient-based learning architecture is further proposed to optimize the condition partition and improve the policy learning performance. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, typical load operation scenarios of an IES are used in our simulations. The human experience strategies and state-of-the-art approaches are selected for comparisons. The results validate the advantages of the proposed approach in terms of cost effectiveness and ability to adapt in uncertain environments.

AB Aiming at the problem of source-load uncertainty caused by the increasing penetration of renewable energy and the large-scale integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into modern power system, a robust optimal operation scheduling algorithm for regional integrated energy systems (RIESs) with such uncertain situations is urgently needed. Based on this background, aiming at the problem of the irregular charging demand of EV, this paper first proposes an EV charging demand model based on the trip chain theory. Secondly, a multi-RIES optimization operation model including a shared energy storage station (SESS) and integrated demand response (IDR) is established. Aiming at the uncertainty problem of renewable energy, this paper transforms this kind of problem into a dynamic robust optimization with time-varying parameters and proposes an improved robust optimization over time (ROOT) algorithm based on the scenario method and establishes an optimal scheduling mode with the minimum daily operation cost of a multi-regional integrated energy system. Finally, the proposed uncertainty analysis method is verified by an example of multi-RIES. The simulation results show that in the case of the improved ROOT proposed in this paper to solve the robust solution of renewable energy, compared with the traditional charging load demand that regards the EVs as a whole, the EV charging load demand based on the trip chain can reduce the cost of EV charging by 3.5% and the operating cost of the multi-RIES by 11.7%. With the increasing number of EVs, the choice of the starting point of the future EV trip chain is more variable, and the choice of charging methods is more abundant. Therefore, modeling the charging demand of EVs under more complex trip chains is the work that needs to be studied in the future.

AB Hydrogen-enriched compressed natural gas (HCNG) is a promising technology capable of significantly reducing carbon emissions in conventional gas units. Its integration into microgrids enhances the coupling and complementarity of diverse energy sources. Shared energy storage systems, which play a crucial role in improving energy utilization, have garnered increasing attention in recent research. However, the deployment of HCNG technology involves multiple stakeholders, posing challenges in balancing their respective benefits. To address this, we propose a novel scheduling method for Integrated Energy Management that accounts for electricity-heatHCNG coupling and shared energy storage services. First, we model the proton exchange membrane electrolyzer and HCNG energy coupling device, incorporating HCNG loads on the demand side to enhance hydrogen production and utilization efficiency. Additionally, tiered carbon trading mechanisms, integrated demand response strategies, and shared energy storage are introduced to optimize carbon reduction on both the demand and storage sides while effectively constraining energy emissions. The strategic interactions between integrated energy microgrid operators and load aggregators are modeled using a Stackelberg game approach, and the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium solutions are rigorously proven. Finally, the proposed model is solved using the Black-winged Kite algorithm in conjunction with the CPLEX solver.Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing revenue increases of 9.15% for integrated energy microgrid operators and 8.29% for load aggregators, alongside a reduction in carbon emissions by 8.76%.

AB Liquefying hydrogen is an efficient way to store and transport hydrogen. However, the hydrogen liquefaction process is energy intensive. Therefore, an integrated liquefaction process of hydrogen and natural gas utilizing the mixed refrigerant cycle and the hydrogen Claude cycle is proposed. The process not only couples a steam methane reforming process to produce hydrogen and a carbon dioxide refrigeration cycle to assist in pre-cooling, but also employs a solar energy absorption refrigeration system to enhance energy efficiency. The proposed process is simulated and optimized using HYSYS and the particle swarm optimization algorithm, and energy, exergy, and economic analyses are performed. The energy analysis shows that the specific energy consumption of the proposed process is 5.2201 kWh/kg, a reduction of 10.67% compared to the base case. The exergy loss and exergy efficiency are 64,904 kW and 62.21%, which are 13.63% and 6.63% lower than the base case, respectively. The economic analysis shows that the total annualized cost of the process is USD 28.6 million per year. The proposed integrated liquefaction process not only realizes the high efficiency of energy utilization but also follows the development trend of integrated energy systems.

AB To efficiently tackle the optimal operation problem of multi-stakeholder integrated energy systems (IESs), this paper develops a multi-objective optimization and multi-attribute decision-making support method. Mathematically, The optimal operation of IESs interconnected with distributed district heating and cooling units (DHCs) via the power grid and gas network, can be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem considering both economic, reliability and environment-friendly objectives with numerous constraints of each energy stakeholder. Firstly, a multi-objective group search optimizer with probabilistic operator and chaotic local search (MPGSO) is proposed to balance global and local optimality during the random search iteration. The MPGSO utilizes a crowding probabilistic operator to select producers to explore areas with higher potential but less crowding and reduce the number of fitness function calculations. Moreover, a new parameter selection strategy based on chaotic sequences with limited computational complexity is adopted to escape the local optimal solutions. Consequently, a set of superior Pareto-optimal fronts could be obtained by the MPGSO. Subsequently, a multi-attribute decision-making support method based on the interval evidential reasoning (IER) approach is used to determine a final optimal solution from the Pareto-optimal solutions, taking multiple attributes of each stakeholder into consideration. To verify the effectiveness of the MPGSO, the DTLZ suite of benchmark problems are tested compared with the original GSOMP, NSGA-II and SPEA2. Additionally, simulation studies are conducted on a modified IEEE 30-bus system connected with distributed DHCs and a 15-node gas network to verify the proposed approach. The quality of the obtained Pareto-optimal solutions is assessed using a set of criteria, including hypervolume (HV), generational distance (GD), and Spacing index, among others. Simulation results show that the number of Pareto-optimal solutions (NPS) of MPGSO are higher by about 32.6 %-62.1%, computation time (CT) are lower by about 2.94 %-46.1 % compared with other algorithms. Besides, to further evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in addressing larger-scale issues, the study employs the modified IEEE 118-bus system of greater magnitude. The proposed MPGSO algorithm effectively handles multi-objective and non-convex optimization problems with Pareto sets in terms of better convergence and distributivity.

AB Rural areas currently exhibit characteristics of multifunctional regional differentiation, with significant differences in energy utilization among different regions and issues such as low renewable energy utilization and unreasonable consumption structures. This paper initially constructs a multiple regional integrated energy systems (MRIES) in rural areas and introduces the Power to ammonia-anaerobic fermentation (P2A-AF) coupled system to enhance the accommodation rate of renewable energy and operational efficiency. Subsequently, random fuzzy modeling is employed to address the random fuzzy uncertainties associated with renewable energy. Then, the MRIES co-optimization model based on peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading is constructed and solved. After that, the conditional value at risk (CVaR) value of net load deviation is introduced to measure the risk level of each RIES, and the improved Shapley value revenue allocation model is constructed. Finally, the simulation yields: compared to standalone operation, the MRIES co-optimization model improves the system economy and the local accommodation of renewable energy by 13.16 % and 9.37 %. The deviations in wind turbine and photovoltaic output characterized by random fuzzy simulation, compared to considering randomness alone, are reduced by 4.33 % and 9.31 %, respectively. The improved Shapley profit distribution model has allocated 41.28 %, 44.66 %, and 14.06 % of the profit to RIES1-3, respectively, ensuring fairness while addressing risk variations. The results demonstrate that the proposed MRIES collaborative optimization model can significantly improve the low-carbon characteristics and economic efficiency of rural energy use. It is suggested that future research consider the source-load characteristics of rural areas in different regions to develop more applicable energy strategies for various rural RIES, providing new insights for global rural energy use.

AB This study investigates the integration of multiple energy carriers within a unified, multi-carrier energy system using an energy cascade approach. The system harnesses geothermal energy to power interconnected subsystems, including an organic Rankine cycle (ORC), liquefied natural gas (LNG), and a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack. The dual ORC system and LNG stream are directly fed from the geothermal source, while the SOFC stack uses methane produced during LNG regasification. Besides electricity, the system generates hydrogen and desalinated water by incorporating a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer and a reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plant. The electricity produced by the upper ORC powers the PEME for hydrogen production, while freshwater production is supported by the combined output from the lower ORC, LNG turbine, and SOFC. A detailed thermo-economic analysis assesses the system's efficiency and economic feasibility. Optimization efforts focus on three areas: electrical efficiency, hydrogen, and freshwater production, using artificial neural networks (ANN) and genetic algorithms (GA). The optimization results reveal that Ammonia-propylene excels in electrical efficiency, R1234ze(Z)-ethane in net power output, R1233zd(E)-propylene in cost-effectiveness, R1234ze(Z)ethane in hydrogen production, and Ammonia-ethane in water production. The study offers valuable insights into enhancing the efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of integrated energy systems.

AB Integrated energy systems (IESs) are essential for enabling the energy transition in communities and reducing CO2 emissions. This paper proposes a novel IES that combines photovoltaic (PV) and solar thermal energy with coordinated electrical and thermal energy storage to meet the energy demands of residential communities. The system also incorporates hydrogen production for fuel cell vehicles. A dual-objective optimization model was developed, minimizing both economic costs and CO2 emissions. The system's performance was evaluated using data from a case study in Dalian, which showed that the IES successfully reduced the annual total cost and CO2 emissions compared to conventional systems. The key findings showed that PV electrolysis for hydrogen production provides both economic and environmental advantages. The system's integration of solar thermal energy offers higher economic efficiency, while PV energy supplies enhance coordination. Additionally, carbon trading prices effectively reduce emissions, but excessively high prices do not always lead to better emission outcomes. This study introduces a comprehensive, multi-energy approach for optimizing the energy supply, contributing novel insights to the field of sustainable energy systems.

AB The clean Energy router based on advanced adiabatic compressed air energy storage (AA-CAES) has the characteristics of large capacity, high efficiency and zero carbon emission which are an effective mitigation scheme for the integration of renewables and peak-shaving and a new clean energy technology for storing energy in the world. A novel solar-thermal-assisted AA-CAES (ST-AA-CAES) is proposed in this paper, integrating variable thermal energy storage to improve the system electric to electric (E2E) and round-trip efficiency (RTE). The efficiency and exergy evaluation of ST-AA-CAES are carried out to determine the performance of ST-AA -CAES. The results illustrate that E2E, RTE, and exergy efficiency can reach 56.4%, 95.5%, and 55.9%, respectively. Meanwhile, the details of exergy efficiency and destruction of each subsystem are demonstrated. Particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to analyse the economy of optimally integrated energy systems which has the advantages of high accuracy, convenient implementation and fast convergence. The system can be applied in abundant solar energy resources area with high efficiency and multi-energy supply capability.

AB As an important part of the new power system, it is crucial to consider the efficiency, economy and environment of the integrated energy system simultaneously. In order to improve the efficiency of solving multi-objective optimization scheduling problems for integrated energy systems, a variable step-size approximation method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a model of integrated energy system is constructed, and the source-side and loadside exergy equations of different energy networks are given, as well as the mathematical expressions of equipment by combining the idea of unification. Secondly, in comparison with the ergodic weights approach, the variable step-size approximation method theoretical minimum reduction percentage of solution time is deduced by mathematical methodology under the m objective functions. Finally, the results from an integrated energy system including a modified New England 30-bus system, a 6-node heat network and a 7-node gas network demonstrate that the multi-objective function proposed compromises the economy, environment and efficiency of integrated energy system compared to the traditional optimization problem. In comparison with the ergodic weights approach, the step size approximation method can save over 97 % of the solution time, and the percentage of average error can be as low as 0 % under the multi-objective functions.

AB Reliable energy supply is a significant challenge for the power system operators. The increase of emerging resources, as well as multi-carrier consumers in energy systems, lead to the integration of multi-carrier energy systems. The energy hub (EH) is one of the central infrastructures which smooths the combination and interdependency of various energy carriers to increase the efficiency and reliability. A novel technology, such as power-to-gas (P2G) storage, is a great option for achieving a renewable resources-based integrated energy system with high efficiency. The P2G storage is regarded as a viable energy storage approach to cover everincreasing renewable energy resources variability in power system operations. The contribution of this paper is to present an optimal stochastic scheduling problem of EH integrated with P2G storage, combined heat and power (CHP) unit, wind power, boiler, electrical storage, and thermal storage to meet electrical, heat, and gas demands considering demand response program (DRP). The load shifting based DRP is applied on the electrical loads to reduce the operation cost of the EH. Also, the P2G storage system is used as a new resource that makes a connection between electrical and natural gas networks by converting the power to hydrogen and after that to natural gas through two processes including electrolysis and mechanization, respectively. A scenario-based stochastic approach is applied to handle the uncertainties related to the electrical loads, wind power, and electricity price. The objective of the proposed problem is to minimize the total operation cost of EH, which is modeled as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem model. The numerical results are implemented for different cases which demonstrate the effectiveness of the integration of the P2G based multi-carrier energy storage and DRPs on the operation cost of EH. The achieved results confirm the proposed approach by demonstrating the considerable reduction in operating cost of the EHS by approximately 7%.

AB Renewable energy is highly efficient, clean, and low-carbon, and it has become the key to energy transformation. The lack of renewable energy consumption capacity has become a major restriction on the development of renewable energy generation industry, and the application of hydrogen storage technology to port integrated energy systems (IES) is considered an effective solution to the problem of grid-connection of renewable energies. The application of hydrogen storage technology to improve renewable energy consumption and integrated energy use has important research significance. This paper studies optimization of the IES considering multi energy collaboration in carbon-free hydrogen ports. Security constrained unit commitment (SCUC) is a key issue in the operation of IES. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is constructed with objectives of minimizing the operating cost of energy system. Furthermore, a customized enhanced particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is designed to solve the SCUC optimization problem. Enhanced PSO can obtain satisfying solutions in large-scale instances within a short time. Extensive numerical experiments have been conducted and the results demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of enhanced PSO in solving problems.

AB Against the backdrop of efforts to achieve "carbon peak" and "carbon neutrality," integrated energy systems (IES) have become an important direction in the development of energy systems due to their advantages of high efficiency, energy saving, and environmental protection. In this paper, a synergistic planning approach for IES considering ground source heat pump (GSHP), organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and power-to-gas (P2G) is proposed. Firstly, this paper constructs a multi-objective planning model for IES that includes ORC, P2G, and GSHP techniques to balance the system's economy, environmental friendliness, and energy efficiency. Subsequently, GSHP heating/cooling ratio, ORC power supply ratio, and direct embedding of P2G are introduced to propose three novel operation strategies (improved following electrical load (IFEL), improved following thermal load (IFTL), and improved following hybrid load (IFHL)). In addition, a novel multi-objective optimizer is proposed to optimize the component sizes and performance of the IES under the proposed different operating strategies. The validity and feasibility of the proposed methodology and operational strategy are verified by analyzing specific cases. The results show that the proposed IES under the operation of IFEL strategy outperforms IFTL and IFHL in terms of improved energy efficiency, reduced operating costs and reduced carbon emissions. Its annual economic cost, energy consumption and pollutant emissions amounted to 979,699.10 $, 10,557,646.34 kWh and 2,389,179.75 kg, respectively. This study not only provides a novel theoretical framework and technical means for the optimization and planning of IES, but also provides an important reference for the development of sustainable energy systems in the future.

AB Establishing integrated energy systems is conducive for improving renewable energy uti-lization and promoting decarbonization. In this study, a grid-connected photovoltaic -hydrogen-natural gas integrated energy system is established to explore the effects of the configuration of the integrated energy system on its environment and economy. A multi -objective hierarchical optimization allocation model is developed, and an optimization strategy with carbon emission superior to total cost is established for the first time. Additionally, the economy, environment, and energy efficiency of the system are analyzed. A comparative study is performed using a strategy considering that the total cost is su-perior to carbon emission. A case study reveals that the levelized cost of electricity in-creases by 62.24%, levelized carbon emission of power decreases by 74.19%, and energy efficiency increases by 8.51%, as compared with those of the comparison strategy. Thus, the carbon emission of the system is reduced considerably, and the energy efficiency is improved. Although the cost of the system optimized by the proposed strategy is higher, it is economically feasible. Further analyses indicate that extending the grid-connected period would be infeasible, as it might increase the total cost and carbon emission of the system. Moreover, sensitivity analyses show that increasing the natural gas price or carbon tax base price will not reduce the carbon emission of the system. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB In this paper, we address the increasing focus on Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and energy policies in S. Korea, advocating for a shift from large, centralized power systems to decentralized Local Power Systems (LPS). This transition emphasizes the integration of Integrated Energy Systems (IES), which significantly enhances the target benefits for stakeholders in the power system. We have also adopted a Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) approach to account for the output uncertainty of RES and developed and applied new ambiguity sets tailored to each RES, enhancing the extensive robust design previously utilized with DRO. By applying our proposed ambiguity set-based DRO, we avoid excessive robustness and achieve superior optimal outcomes compared to the general DRO methodology, potentially making a significant contribution to business investment decisions. We have categorized the main stakeholders of the power system as Independent Systems Operators (ISO), Renewable Energy Providers (REP), Energy Exchange Aggregators (EXA), and End-users. The integration of IES leads to a benefit improvement rate of up to 34.8 %, 23.0 %, and 24.2 % for ISOs, REPs, and End-users, respectively, on a global scale. EXAs can secure an annual economic profit of up to $191,362.

Faced with the problem that the central position of thermal power cannot be transformed quickly, utilizing traditional thermal power units in a low-carbon and efficient manner is the premise to guarantee green energy development. This study focuses on the integrated energy production system (IEPS) and a stochastic optimization model for capacity configuration that integrates carbon capture storage and power-to-gas while considering source-load uncertainty. Firstly, carbon capture storage and power-to-gas technologies are introduced, and the architecture and models of the IEPS are established. The carbon and hydrogen storage equipment configuration enhances the system's flexibility. Also, source-load uncertainty is considered, and a deterministic transformation is applied using the simultaneous backward reduction algorithm combined with K-means clustering. The paper simulates the optimal capacity configuration of the IEPS in a park energy system in Suzhou, China. Furthermore, the research performs a sensitivity analysis on coal, natural gas, and carbon tax prices. Case studies verified that IEPS can realize the recycling of electricity, gas, hydrogen, and carbon, with remarkable characteristics of low-carbon, flexibility, and economical. Stochastic optimized capacity allocation results considering source-load uncertainty are more realistic. Sensitivity intervals for energy prices can reference pricing mechanisms in energy markets. This study can provide ideas for the transition of China's energy structure and offer directions to the low-carbon sustainable development of the energy system.

AB Aiming to address the prevailing issue where Cold Heat and Power (CCHP)-type integrated energy systems are primarily optimized for either economy or environmental friendliness, this paper conducts an exhaustive synergistic optimization analysis of the CCHP system, focusing on the dual objectives of economy and environmental friendliness. In this study, an optimization model of the CCHP system encompassing units such as gas turbines, gas boilers, and electric chillers is formulated. By integrating Pareto theory, an adaptive grid method, and a roulette strategy into the multiverse algorithm, an enhanced multi-objective multiverse algorithm is developed, which notably enhances the convergence accuracy, convergence speed, and stability of the solutions. A case study conducted in a representative northern region yielded the following experimental results: When compared with both the traditional particle swarm algorithm and an improved version of it, the CCHP-type integrated energy system optimized using the enhanced multi-objective multiverse algorithm reduced operating costs by 7.98% and carbon dioxide emissions by 12%, relative to the original system. This outcome underscores the remarkable capability of the improved multiverse algorithm in balancing the economic and environmental aspects of the system, thereby providing a robust foundation and valuable reference for the planning and design of subsequent energy supply systems. Through this synergistic optimization analysis, a win-win scenario is achieved, balancing both economic and environmental benefits, which lays a solid groundwork for the sustainable development of future energy systems.

AB The cooperative planning of interconnected networks to achieve a sustainable operation and satisfy the welfare of all agents has become a critical issue. This paper optimizes the joint scheduling of integrated electricity and gas grids composed of wind turbines, pho-tovoltaics, storage systems, power to gas and gas to power units. In this regard, a risk-constrained multi-objective programming is suggested to simultaneously model the operation costs of both networks and a robust augmented epsilon constraint method is applied to solve the problem and obtain the Pareto set. In order to simulate realistic con-ditions, uncertainties of wind and solar energies, electrical and gas loads and energy and gas prices are also considered. As well, the impact of flexible electrical and gas loads is analyzed using a time-of-use demand response program. According to the simulations, the presented approach is capable to create a good equilibrium between both networks. The results validate that the risk-averse strategy significantly increases the costs of electrical and gas grids by 21.41% and 10.36% compared to the risk-neutral strategy, respectively. In return, the robustness is improved against fluctuations caused by uncertain parameters. Moreover, responsive loads enhance decision flexibility and decrease the mentioned costs by 2.26% and 7.83%, respectively.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB With the development of integrated energy systems, the system energy demands become more complicated and the renewable energy proportion becomes higher. Under this background, integrated energy systems gradually present a state of high randomness and strong uncertainty, which affects the system collaborative optimization. In order to handle the multiple uncertainties' effects effectively, multi-objective optimization considering uncertainties of energy demand and renewable energy using information gap decision theory (IGDT) method was carried out. By analyzing the optimization results and comparing the results of different weight coefficient of multiple uncertainties, the renewable energy uncertainty has a strong effect, while the energy demand uncertainty's effect is more complex.

AB This study proposes a multi-time scale dynamic optimization (MSDO) method for ultra-short-term scheduling in industrial electricity-heat-gas integrated energy systems. The aim is to enhance the feasibility of scheduling schemes and to utilize flexibility potential. The MSDO method considers equipment response differences and demand fulfillment time disparities. The dynamic aspect is reflected in the supply-demand matching within the scheduling time window. A single-layer model with unified temporal granularity is constructed based on lag parameter identification. The study proposes various forms of energy demand elasticity, including steam networks and cumulative demand, and investigates the optimal minimum temporal granularity for scheduling. Case results demonstrate that the MSDO method effectively characterizes the multi-energy time lag of equipment. Compared with methods disregarding lag parameters, the MSDO method enhances total profit by yen 120711.42 and improves operation stability by 2.96%. The MSDO method outperforms baseline methods in cost and stability, accommodating a 160% increase in renewable energy growth. Under different elasticity spaces, the profit of the cumulative demand method exceeds that of the average method. The time lag of different equipment impacts scheduling profits. An optimal choice exists for the minimum temporal granularity to strike a balance between computational efficiency, economy, and feasibility.

AB In the context of energy transformation, the importance of energy storage devices in regional integrated energy systems (RIESs) is becoming increasingly prominent. To explore the impact of energy storage devices on the design and operation of RIESs, this paper first establishes a bi-level dynamic optimization model with the total system cost as the optimization objective. The optimization model is used to optimize the design of three RIESs with different energy storage devices, including System 1 without an energy storage device, System 2 with a thermal energy storage (TES) device, and System 3 with TES and electrical energy storage (EES) devices. According to the design and operation results, the impact of energy storage devices on the operational performance of RIESs is analyzed. The results show that under the design conditions, energy storage devices can significantly increase the capacity of the combined heating and power units and absorption chillers in System 2 and System 3 and reduce the capacity of the ground source heat pumps and gas boilers; the impact of the TES device on System 3 is more significant. Affected by systems' configuration, the operating cost, carbon tax, and total cost of System 2 are reduced by 2.9%, 5.5%, and 1.5% compared with System 1, respectively. The EES device can more significantly reduce the operating cost of System 3, with a reduced rate of 5.7% compared with that in System 1. However, the higher equipment cost makes the total cost reduction rate of System 3 less than that of System 1, which is 1.75%. Similar to the design conditions, under the operation conditions, the TES device can effectively reduce the carbon tax, operating cost, and total cost of System 2, while System 3 with an EES device can significantly reduce its operating cost regardless of whether the energy price changes or not. To some extent, this study systematically elucidated the impact of TES and EES devices on the optimal design and operation performance of RIESs and provided a certain reference for the configuration of energy storage devices.

AB Regional integrated energy systems (IESs) have emerged to satisfy the increasing diversified energy demand in Tibet. However, limited resource allocation of a given IES can occur because of the uncertainty in the output and prediction error of distributed renewable energy (DRE). A distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model was proposed for the joint operation of multiple regional IESs, and multi-energy sharing and multi-energy flow coupling of electricity, heat, and oxygen were considered. The probability distribution of the DRE output was described using 1- norm and oo- norm constraints, and the minimum operating cost under adverse scenarios was determined through DRO. Furthermore, on the premise of ensuring cluster profit, a pricing mechanism of the energy supply within the cluster was proposed. Finally, a typical model involving eight cases was established and analyzed. The results revealed that multi-energy sharing and multi-energy flow coupling improved the economy of IFS cluster operation and realized the coordination of robustness and economy. The energy supply price within the cluster enhanced enthusiasm on the demand side.

AB In the modern metropolitan regions, the coupling among distribution networks (DNs), gas networks (GNs), and transportation networks (TNs) is increasingly intensified, which gives rise to the urgent demand for efficient modeling and solving methods. In this context, a mathematical model for the configuration planning of integrated energy systems is proposed in this paper. With the aim of minimizing total planning costs, the model jointly considers the investment and operation strategies for distribution lines, distributed wind power generators (DWGs), combined heat and power units (CHPs), power to gas units (P2Gs), gas furnaces (GFs), fast charging facilities (FCFs) and slow charging facilities (SCFs). Since the proposed model comes down to a non convex and nonlinear optimization problem, a two-layer algorithm is designed to solve it. In the outer layer, a genetic algorithm (GA) is performed to obtain a set of individuals representing the investment decisions on distribution lines, DWGs, and FCFs, which will be delivered to the inner layer model. With fixed decision variables, the inner model optimizes the operating costs, charging profit coefficients, and strategies for DWGs and energy converters in a coordinated manner. A real urban area in China is employed in the numerical experiment, which corroborates the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution algorithm.

AB To address the challenges posed by various uncertainties in integrated energy systems (IES) for planning and operation, this paper considers the capacity configuration of IES equipment with energy storage systems under a stepped carbon trading mechanism, as well as the planning of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations under different charging modes. A two-stage stochastic robust planning method is proposed, taking into account both short- and long-term uncertainties in renewable energy generation and electric, thermal, and cooling loads. In the first stage, planning decisions are made with the objective of minimizing investment costs, while accounting for the seasonal characteristics of the "source-load"relationship in the planning phase. Stochastic programming is employed to handle long-term uncertainties. In the second stage, operational simulation is performed with the goal of minimizing energy dispatch costs and carbon trading costs, and short-term uncertainties in "source-load"operations are described using robust optimization. The nested column-and- constraint generation (NC&CG) algorithm is used to solve this two-stage model. Finally, the proposed model is applied to an IES in northern China. The results show that orderly EV charging within the IES can reduce both investment and operational costs, as well as carbon emissions. The consideration of a stepped carbon trading mechanism can reduce system carbon emissions and enhance environmental sustainability. IES planning with multiple energy storage types is more economical than with a single energy storage type, and the proposed stochastic robust planning method, which considers both long- and short-term uncertainties, demonstrates stronger reliability and economic performance under extreme conditions.

AB To address the reliability and stability of the supply-demand balance in integrated energy systems, a supply- demand optimization strategy that considers wind and photovoltaic power generation uncertainties and integrated demand response is proposed. On the supply side, a robust stochastic optimization model is developed to describe the uncertainty of wind and photovoltaic power output, considering the effect of time on the prediction error of wind and photovoltaic power output. Additionally, a electricity-heat-hydrogen hybrid energy storage model is developed to improve system flexibility by accounting for the lifetime loss of energy storage. On the demand side, a packaged demand-side management approach is proposed to incentivize user participation in integrated demand response. Finally, the supply-demand model is solved using the Karush- Kuhn-Tucker condition and the Big-M method. The simulation results show that the intraday revenue of the Energy Hub is increased by 17.22%, and the maximum intraday consumer surplus of the load aggregator is increased by 6.31%. The total cost of hybrid energy storage is reduced by 5.21%, and wind-photovoltaic utilization is increased by 2.1% compared to a single electric energy storage configuration. The total cost of hybrid energy storage is reduced by 4.26%, and wind-photovoltaic utilization is increased by 1.5% compared to the electric-heat storage combination. After considering the battery life, the configured capacity of the hybrid energy storage battery decreased by 10.06%.

AB A novel smart management approach is proposed for optimization, management, and analysis of integrated energy systems considering contemporary economic, safety, and environmental policies referred to as 3M methodology. Accordingly, three key scenarios are defined including an urban plant application (S-I), a domestic economic growth policy (S-II), and a sustainable development plan (S-III). The proposed systems are globally optimized considering exergoeconomic, exergorisk, and exergoenvironmental analyses using a weighted multi-objective optimization in accordance with the circumstances of S-I, and S-III. Subsequently, a suitable optimal system is selected using a hybrid deterministic fuzzy-TOPSIS approach among optimal configurations, and the best working fluid is allocated via system-based multi-scale management. The MGS allocating R718, R141b, R123, R142b, and R365mfc had smaller total environmental impact rate, smaller total cost rate, lower heat losses, and lower consumption of cold utility in all scenarios compared to the CGS. In turn, the CGS allocating R718 had the smallest total specific risk (0.602 injury.MJ(-1)) in the S-I than the MGS (0.811 injury.MJ(-1)). However, the MGS allocating R123 had a lower consumption of cold utility in the S-II (3.92 MW) and S-III (3.90 MW).

AB To optimally design integrated energy systems a widely used approach is the Energy Hub. The conversion, storage and transfer of different energy vectors is represented by a coupling matrix. Yet, the coupling matrix restricts the configuration of the Energy Hub and the constraints, that can be included. This paper proposes a MILP based optimization framework, which allows a high variability and adaptability and is based on energy flows. The functionality of the developed framework is tested on four use cases depicting different system sizes and Energy Hub configurations. It is shown that the framework is able to simplify the design process of an Energy Hub.

AB Accurately assessing energy flow is of paramount importance for achieving the dual objectives of economic efficiency and energy efficiency in the operation of electric-thermal integrated energy systems. The generic thermal network model is commonly used to describe operating characteristics under baseline conditions. However, due to the high-dimensional nonlinear nature of solving its parameters, traditional methods have limitations. In this study, to address this issue, we conduct dual-mode detailed simulation analysis for the hydraulic and thermal processes of the thermal network. The finite difference method is employed to calculate dynamic parameters. Based on this, a network loss model is constructed using the mean square deviation method. To achieve the dual objectives of integrated energy system operation optimization, the NSGA-II algorithm and VIKOR decision rules are applied to obtain the optimal solution. Using these methods and taking a specific electric-thermal integrated energy system in the northern region as an example, we simulate and analyze the data of the system operation under three thermal network modes. The results indicate that the refined thermal network model can reduce the total operating cost to $16,871 and achieve an energy efficiency of 83.219 %, outperforming the results of other operational modes.

AB The interconnection of multiple regional integrated energy systems (RIES) can effectively enhance the lowcarbon and flexible operation capabilities of RIES, but the uncertainty and multi-energy interaction of the system pose challenges to the stable operation of RIES. Therefore, a stochastic hierarchical optimization and revenue allocation approach is proposed to optimize the operational strategy of multi-RIES with multi-operator participation, multi-energy interactions, and multiple uncertainties. Firstly, agent-based modeling, Latin hypercube sampling and simultaneous backward reduction based on the Wasserstein metric are proposed to capture the power-side and load-side uncertainties. Secondly, based on the Nash bargaining game and the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm, multi-RIES peer-to-peer transactions of electricity, thermal, and natural gas are optimized through energy cooperation and scheduling strategies. Subsequently, a Nash-Harsanyi bargaining game revenue allocation method that considers both fairness and renewable energy accommodation is proposed to ensure the stable operation of the alliance. Finally, simulations are conducted on a multi-RIES in northern China, demonstrating that the proposed model and approach can achieve inter-grid flexible resource complementarity, improve RIES economics, increase local renewable energy accommodation rate, and reduce carbon emissions.

AB As the increasing complexity and uncertainty of integrated energy systems, the cooperative interaction under uncertainty between the energy hub (EH) and multi-energy users has become crucial for the efficient operation of energy systems. This paper proposes a unified collaborative and interactive framework to optimize operations between the EH and multi-energy users under uncertainty. Firstly, in the horizontal dimension, the stochastic distributionally robust chance-constrained (S-DRCC) optimization method with the Wasserstein metric is proposed to hedge against the uncertainty of EH considering the multiple scenarios and moment information of uncertain variables. Then in the vertical dimension, a bilevel Stackelberg game model is developed for EH and users to facilitate the collaborative interaction for multi-agents. Furthermore, several efficient methods are leveraged to reformulate the originally intractable framework into a tractable mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that can be directly solved using commercial solvers. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model and method are demonstrated by numerical case studies and corresponding simulation results.

AB This paper demonstrates a novel modular distributed framework that uses optimal energy-dispatching strategies to enable greater flexibility and profitability in nuclear-renewable integrated energy systems (NR-IES). Hydrogen is used as a commodity in this framework since its production can improve grid stability and system operational flexibility, decarbonize heavy industry, and create an additional revenue stream for electricity generators, particularly nuclear power plants with high operational expenses. The proposed solution addresses the challenges associated with merging multiple software and services from various domains by using functional mock-up units (FMU) to co-simulate diverse subsystems designed in various platforms. The tightly coupled integrated energy system (IES) is optimized to maximize revenue by utilizing the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique to make smart dispatching decisions based on variable electricity prices and the availability of renewable energy. Proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used in training and testing the DRL agent. Over a period of 120 days, the proposed hydrogen-based IES framework showed about 10% revenue boost compared to a non-hydrogen generating baseline IES while also providing an easily-adoptable framework which can help to improve the flexibility of future generation nuclear power plants.

AB Community multi-energy systems (CMESs) are emerging as a pivotal solution to address the pressing issues of the current energy crisis and environmental pollution. This paper introduces a comprehensive multi-horizon risk-averse scheduling strategy for CMESs, targeting participation in energy and flexible ramp markets while meeting the demands of electric, natural gas, and hydrogen vehicle charging stations, data centers, and residential and commercial buildings. The proposed CMES incorporates power-to-x vector coupling storage (PtX-VCS) systems, enabling the storage of electricity in various forms to cater to multi-energy demands. Additionally, an integrated demand response (IDR) program, incorporating incentive and load-shifting strategies, is applied to enhance operational efficiency and system flexibility. To manage uncertainties effectively, a hybrid stochastic/robust/fuzzy information gap decision theory (IGDT) method is employed. This approach, formulated as a tri-level optimization model, is transformed into a single-level model using strong duality theory. The results demonstrate a notable reduction in daily operational costs by approximately 5% and 4% through the implementation of the IDR program and PtX-VCS technologies, respectively. Moreover, the CMES's potential to participate in the flexible ramping market leads to an approximately 7% reduction in total operational costs.

AB Lithium-ion Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) have been widely adopted in energy systems due to their many advantages. However, the high energy density and thermal stability issues associated with lithium-ion batteries have led to a rise in BESS-related safety incidents, which often bring about severe casualties and property losses. To accurately evaluate the safety of lithium-ion BESS, this study proposes a probabilistic risk assessment method (PRA) that incorporates fuzzy fault tree analysis (FFTA) with expert knowledge aggregation. This approach takes into account the impact of BESS design variations and provides risk probability estimates for safety incidents in BESS. Based on the risk assessment, an energy system design framework is developed. This framework introduces a quantified risk indicator for BESS and establishes a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to examine the implications of BESS design on self-safety, as well as its interactive effects on the economics of integrated energy systems (IES). A case study conducted in an industrial park in Ningde, China, demonstrates that differences in safety requirements from investors can lead to cost variations of up to 6.8%. Furthermore, the study reveals the deep coupling between the safety and economics of BESS, highlighting that cost-optimal approach which neglects safety can result in a 4.5% increase in the probability of BESS safety incident risk compared to a safety-optimal approach. Overall, this study contributes to the understanding of the interplay between safety and economics in BESS design. By employing a combination of quantitative evaluation and mathematical optimization methods, the present study provides a rational and feasible strategy, as well as modeling perspective, for the safety design of BESS, paving the way for safer and more efficient integration BESS in integrated energy systems.

AB The integrated energy system effectively improves the comprehensive utilization of energy through cascade utilization and coordinated scheduling of various types of energy. Based on the independent integrated energy system, the thermal network interaction between different load characteristic regions is introduced, requiring a minimum thermal grid construction cost, CCHP investment operation cost and carbon emission tax as the comprehensive optimization targets, and making overall optimization to the configuration and operation of the multi-region integrated energy systems. This paper focuses on the planning of equipment capacity of multi-region integrated energy system based on a CCHP system and heat network. Combined with the above comprehensive target and heat network model, a mixed integer linear programming model for a multi-region CCHP system capacity collaborative optimization configuration is established. The integrated energy system, just a numerical model solved with the LINGO software, is presented. Taking a typical urban area in Shanghai as an example, the simulation results show that the integrated energy system with multi-zone heat-suply network interaction compared to the single area CCHP model improved the clean energy utilization of the system, rationally allocates equipment capacity, promotes the local consumption of distributed energy, and provides better overall system benefits.

DT Article
AB Renewable energy generation has become the general trend with increasing environmental problems. However, the instability of renewable energy generation and the diversification of user demand are highlighted and the optimization of energy scheduling has become the key to solve the problem. This study introduces an energy scheduling optimization model tailored for building integrated energy systems, encompassing elements like gas turbines, wind and solar modules, ground source heat pumps, electric vehicles, central air-conditioning, and energy storage. The model prioritizes economic efficiency and minimal carbon emissions by first collecting and pre-processing the data for the regional building conformance, and then utilizing an enhanced multi-objective genetic whale algorithm. Evaluations on a regional complex building highlighted the algorithm's robust convergence and stability. The resulting optimized scheduling effectively balances economic and environmental concerns, reducing costs by about 92.896 yuan per day on average and reducing carbon emissions by about 0.091 tons, promoting efficient system operation, reducing costs and mitigating environmental impacts.

AB With the intensification of the energy crisis and the global greenhouse effect, it is particularly necessary to develop renewable energy generation and reduce carbon emissions. Therefore, a low-carbon economic dispatch model of the electricity-gas-heat integrated energy system (IES) considering ladder-type carbon trading mechanism (LCTM), vehicles charging, and multimode utilization of hydrogen is proposed. A multimode utilization of hydrogen model in the IES is established and the model energy flow is analyzed. The vehicles charging demand is simulated by Monte Carlo, which provides a model to calculate the carbon emissions of vehicles. In addition, the ladder-type carbon trading mechanism and integrated demand response are introduced to improve the system economy and low carbon performance. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model can significantly reduce carbon emissions and improve the economy of the IES.

AB Integrated energy systems offer substantial potential for enhancing renewable energy integration. However, due to the distinct dynamic characteristics between system components, the characterization of system flexibility in integrated energy systems remains a challenge. This further complicates their optimal design, as underestimation or overestimation of flexibility during design can result in unexpected operational performance degradation. This article aims to improve the accuracy of system flexibility characterization in the optimal design of an integrated energy system, and address the conflict between high-precision modeling requirements and the difficulty of solving high-dimensional optimization problems. Specifically, higher temporal resolution operational constraints are adopted to characterize system flexibility, and a variable temporal resolution optimization method is developed, which could effectively reduce computational burden whilst maintaining accuracy. Optimization results demonstrate a significant reduction in solving time, approximately 98.5 %, compared to directly shortening the time step. Moreover, the proposed method ensures optimal results with a reliable system configuration, preventing load loss during operation. Additionally, it significantly reduces total ramping amount and adjustment times of coal-fired units by over 56.0 % and 32.3 % respectively, while achieving a 0.9 % reduction in carbon emissions. Despite these benefits, the total annual costs of the system only experience a minimal increase of 0.6 %.

AB In order to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency, sustainable energy systems such as multi-energy microgrids (MEMGs) with the high penetration of renewable energy resources (RES) and satisfying different energy needs of consumers have received significant attention in recent years. MEMGs, by relying on renewable resources and energy storage systems along with energy conversion systems, play an essential role in sustainability of energy supply. However, renewable energies are uncertain due to the intermittent nature of solar and wind energy sources. Thus, optimal operation of the MEMGs with the consideration of the uncertainties of RES is necessary to achieve sus-tainability. In this paper, risk constrained scheduling of a MEMG is carried out with the presence of the PV, wind, biomass, electric vehicles (EVs) and hydrogen vehicles (HVs) charging stations, combined heat and power (CHP), boiler, hydrogen electrolyzer (HE), cryptocurrency miners (CMs), electrical, thermal and hydrogen storage systems, respon-sive demands. From the trading and business model side, the proposed MEMG optimized operation relies on bilateral contracts between producers and consumers and pool elec-tricity markets. A two-stage stochastic programming method is used for considering the uncertainties of electrical, thermal and hydrogen demands, EV and HV charging stations load, CM load, PV and wind power, and the price of electricity purchased from the pool market. The proposed mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is solved using the CPLEX solver in GAMS which guarantees to achieve a globally optimal solution. The results show that due to the certain prices of bilateral contracts, the possibility of transaction by bilateral contracts decreases the risk metric CVaR by 50.42%. The simulation results demonstrate that risk of high operation costs while considering flexibility sources, such as storages and demand response (DR) programs, is decreased by 5.45% and 4.6%, respec-tively. As far as operation costs are concerned, results reveal that using renewable re-sources decreases operation costs by 34.47%. Moreover, the operation cost is reduced by 5.94% and 4.57% in the presence of storage units and DR programs, respectively. In the same way, storages and DR programs decrease cost of purchased electricity by 13.47% and 14.46%, respectively.& COPY; 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID NATURAL-GAS SYSTEMS; ECONOMIC-DISPATCH; POWER; ELECTRICITY; WIND
AB In integrated energy systems, uncertainties cause day-ahead scheduling plans to be uncertain rather than an exact solution. However, traditional interval optimization models ignore the correlation between variables, resulting in an over-conservative range of solutions. To overcome this limitation, the present paper proposes a modified affine arithmetic to establish an interval optimal scheduling model based on deterministic optimization. The correlation between different variables is tracked by sharing noise terms, and the solution in affine form is transformed into a more intuitive interval solution by a modified affine approximation method and linear relaxation method. Finally, with the minimum midpoint and radii of daily operating cost interval as the objective function, the multi-objective function is converted into a single-objective function through Lagrange multiplication to solve the model. In a case study, the proposed method is compared with the Monte Carlo simulation method and the traditional interval optimization method without affine arithmetic. The simulation results show that the radii of the interval solutions obtained by the proposed method is 9.39% less than the traditional interval arithmetic at the 15% level of uncertainty.

AB As the global energy mix transforms and the demand for clean energy increases, integrated energy systems (IES) are gaining attention for their ability to enable the complementary and optimal allocation of multiple energy sources. However, the volatility of renewable energy can affect the stability and reliability of energy supply, thereby limiting its penetration in IES. Hydrogen energy storage, as a novel energy storage solution, offers advantages such as a long regulation period and large storage capacity. These characteristics can promote the consumption of renewable energy, reduce system operating costs, and improve overall energy efficiency. This paper proposes a multi-objective capacity optimization allocation model based on the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. An operation strategy of "set electricity by cooling and heat by electricity" is also proposed. Three scenarios are established to optimize the scheduling of power generation, energy storage, and loads in the IES. The performance of the IES is analyzed on typical days to verify the feasibility of the proposed strategy and model. The results show that, compared with the system without energy storage, the system configured with hydrogen storage increases the renewable energy consumption rate by 6.54 %, and reduces carbon emissions and grid interaction power by 4.78 % and 45.01 %, respectively. Compared with the system configured with batteries and water storage tank only, the renewable energy consumption rate increases by 0.33 %, and carbon emissions and grid interaction power are reduced by 3.35 % and 19.08 %, respectively. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the research significance of optimizing device configurations.

AB Energy is an important support for national economic development, and energy security directly affects national security, sustainable development, and social stability. The Middle East has the largest energy reserves in the world. Saudi Arabia is located in the Middle East and is a big energy country with very rich resources. With the reduction of fossil fuels and the increasingly prominent problem of climate change, the sustainable supply of energy while reducing environmental pollution and economic costs in the process of energy use is a problem facing the world today. In order to fully absorb clean energy, improve energy efficiency, and reduce fuel costs and environmental costs, we studied the impact of BIM digital information technology on the economic optimization of integrated energy systems. The integrated energy system has the characteristics of multienergy input and multienergy output. In terms of energy output, the system uses the principle of energy cascade utilization to recover and utilize the waste heat generated by the traditional generator set and then collects it through absorption. Compared with the traditional single-stage utilization of energy, the integrated energy system uses various forms of power, for example, power, heating, cooling, and natural gas, to achieve economic optimization by improving the comprehensive energy utilization efficiency through multienergy complementation. Through the investigation and comparison of the optimal dispatching operation cost, energy use cost, pollutant treatment cost, and equipment maintenance cost of 3 enterprises, the results show that the comprehensive energy system using BIM digital information technology can reduce the energy use cost by 8.7%. Moreover, the cost of pollutant treatment and the cost of equipment maintenance have been reduced to a certain extent, which has a certain optimization effect on the economy of comprehensive energy of enterprises.

AB Nowadays, energy system planners are looking for effective solutions to take advantage of the opportunities inherent in integrated energy systems. Data centers and electric vehicles are appealing candidates for implementing integrated energy management strategies due to their high energy capacity and high flexibility potential. Hence, this paper presents a multi-objective optimization framework for optimal energy management of a virtual energy hub (VEH) plant to manage and meet the required demands of data centers, adjacent buildings, and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). To this end, a mixed robust-stochastic strategy is established to solve the unit commitment problem in the context of the VEH plant and implement an integrated demand response program (DRP) to maximize the VEH plant's profit, minimize carbon emission, and mitigate the risk of uncertainties. The considered VEH plant can serve the demands using the unique features of energy conversion equipment, i.e., electrical chiller, electrical boiler, combined heat and power, and renewable energy sources. The Pareto optimal solution is employed to handle the multi-objective problem with the epsilon-constrained method's means as mixed-integer linear programming. The presented structure is solved with a powerful commercial optimization tool, namely GAMS software. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in the presence of the integrated DRP and up-to-date energy storage systems by increasing the profit of the VEH plant by up to 7.14% and reducing carbon emissions by up to 1.02% compared to the base case study in meeting the demands of the data center and PEVs.

AB As part of the "dual carbon" objectives, using excess clean energy to electrolyze water and produce hydrogen is crucial to achieving zero carbon emissions in the energy and power industries. The markets for hydrogen, carbon, and green certificates display significant interconnections. This study suggests a coordinated optimization model for integrated energy systems under multi-market coupling to facilitate the deep integration of hydrogen and carbon. Firstly, investigate the interactive relationship between hydrogen trading, CCER trading, green power certificate trading, and carbon trading mechanism, which will contribute to accurately quantifying the dispatch costs of each unit under the guidance of the coupled market mechanism. Secondly, a game optimization model for integrated energy systems is created, with hydrogen sales operators as leaders and hydrogen sales companies and customers as followers. Finally, the enhanced Kriging meta-model is employed to precisely simulate the price response patterns of hydrogen trading operators and resolve the master-slave game model. The results of the case study analysis show that the model can deeply integrate hydrogen, carbon, and green certificate markets via carbon and hydrogen prices. This integration can lead to improved economic and low-carbon functioning of integrated energy systems.

AB Two novel integrated models for power-to-gas (P2G) with carbon capture system (CCS) and hydrogen fuel cell (HFC) are proposed to further reduce the carbon emission of the integrated energy system (IES). First, a joint operation framework on the strength of P2G with CCS and HFC (PCH) is proposed. Then, based on PCH, two modeling and analysis methods of 'setting gas with heat (SGWH)' and 'setting energy with carbon (SEWC)' are proposed, under which two new integration models are established PCH under the SGWH (PCH_SGWH) and PCH under the SEWC (PCH_SEWC), and their electricity, heat, gas, and carbon coupling characteristics are analyzed. Finally, coupled with combined heat and power (CHP), gas boiler (GB), and energy storage (ES), an IES low-carbon economic dispatch model considering a carbon trading mechanism is constructed. The contribution of PCH and PCH_SGWH and PCH_SEWC to low-carbon operation is compared and verified by setting multiple operational scenarios. The simulation results show that compared with IES without PCH, IES with PCH_SGWH, and IES with PCH_SEWC can comprehensively improve the low-carbon economy of IES from the perspectives of wind power ab-sorption, carbon generation, emission, and operating cost. Among them, IES with PCH_SEWC shows better performance, which can increase the wind power absorption rate by 21.96%, reduce carbon pro-duction and carbon emissions by 21.25% and 64.4%, and reduce operating costs by 44.7%.

AB The transformation from a fossil fuel economy to a low-carbon economy has reshaped the way energy is transmitted. As most renewable energy is obtained in the form of electricity, using green electricity to produce hydrogen is considered a promising energy carrier. However, most studies have not considered the transportation mode of hydrogen. In order to encourage the utilization of renewable energy and hydrogen, this paper proposes a comprehensive energy system optimization operation strategy considering multi-mode hydrogen transport. Firstly, to address the shortcomings in the optimization operation of existing systems regarding hydrogen transport, modeling is conducted for multi-mode hydrogen transportation through hydrogen tube trailers and pipelines. This model reflects the impact of multi-mode hydrogen delivery channels on hydrogen utilization, which helps promote the consumption of new energy in electrolysis cells to meet application demands. Based on this, the constraints of electrolyzers, combined heat and power units, hydrogen fuel cells, and energy storage systems in integrated energy systems (IESs) are further considered. With the objective of minimizing the daily operational cost of the comprehensive energy system, an optimization model for the operation considering multi-mode hydrogen transport is constructed. Lastly, based on simulation examples, the impact of multi-mode hydrogen transportation on the operational cost of the system is analyzed in detail. The results indicate that the proposed optimization strategy can reduce the operational cost of the comprehensive energy system. Hydrogen tube trailers and pipelines will have a significant impact on operational costs. Properly allocating the quantity of hydrogen tube trailers and pipelines is beneficial for reducing the operational costs of the system. Reasonable arrangement of hydrogen transportation channels is conducive to further promoting the green and economic operation of the system.

AB The growing integration of renewable energy sources into the power grid necessitates innovative approaches to energy system management. Integrated gas and electricity networks offer a promising solution to this challenge, enabling the efficient, reliable, and sustainable operation of energy systems. This paper presents a novel approach to the optimal scheduling of integrated gas and electricity networks, addressing the challenges posed by high penetration of renewable energy sources. First, a learning-assisted methodology is proposed to leverage Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Bayesian-based uncertainty models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of scheduling integrated energy systems. The proposed GCN model effectively captures the complex interactions within the integrated network, facilitating accurate power and gas flow predictions. Meanwhile, the Bayesian-based model adeptly manages the inherent uncertainties associated with renewable energy generation, employing a chance-constrained approach to ensure system reliability. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through extensive simulations on an IEEE 39-bus electricity network coupled with a 22-node hydrogen network. Results indicate significant improvements in computational efficiency and predictive accuracy compared to traditional model-based methods and existing data-driven techniques.

AB Connections among multi-energy systems become increasingly closer with the extensive application of various energy equipment such as gas-fired power plants and electricity-driven gas compressor. Therefore, the integrated energy system has attracted much attention. This paper establishes a gas-electricity joint operation model, proposes a system evaluation index based on the energy quality character after considering the grade difference of the energy loss of the subsystem, and finds an optimal scheduling method for integrated energy systems. Besides, according to the typical load characteristics of commercial and residential users, the optimal scheduling analysis is applied to the integrated energy system composed of an IEEE 39 nodes power system and a 10 nodes natural gas system. The results prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Promoting renewable energy and developing low -carbon integrated energy systems are noteworthy in the energy sector. However, in existing works on the integrated energy system, the coupling of green certificate and carbon trading mechanism under diversified utilization of hydrogen energy has not been fully considered to provide an incentive effect for uncertain renewable energy resources. Based on these considerations, a multi-timescale optimization of an integrated energy system with diversified utilization of hydrogen energy is studied under the coupling of green certificate and carbon trading mechanism. First, the coupled interaction mechanism of green certificate trading -stepped carbon trading is proposed by linking stepped carbon trading to green certificate trading through green certificates. Furthermore, the establishment of the diversified utilization unit of hydrogen energy addresses carbon emissions from the perspective of energy application and offers fresh concepts for a low -carbon economy. Then, an optimized scheduling model for multiple time scales of dayahead/intraday/real-time is developed to reduce the impact of renewable energy prediction errors on system operation. Results acquired from case studies demonstrate the effectiveness in terms of achieving economic and low carbon. The accommodation level of renewable energy with a coupling mechanism improves by 3.08% compared to that without considering coupling. In addition, the diversified utilization of the hydrogen energy model enables the reduction in total cost and carbon emission by 5.14% and 2.4927 tonnes in comparison to the traditional power -to -gas mode.

AB Hydrogen storage tanks (HST) play a crucial role in integrating renewable energy (RE) into gas-electric integrated energy systems (GEIES), overcoming the intermittency of RE. The hydrogen stored in HST can be transported through natural gas pipeline network (NGPN). However, the effects of HST pressure limits and hydrogen blending ratios on GEIES operation remains unclear. To minimize RE curtailment, this paper introduces a multi-node hydrogen blending (MNHB) mode, and develops a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization model with the objective of minimizing the daily system operating cost. This model takes into account hydrogen storage tank pressure limits (HSTPL) and hydrogen blending fluctuations (HBF) within NGPN. For enhanced solution efficiency, natural gas (NG) pipeline flow equations and generator equations are linearized. HST pressure sensitivity analysis shows that when the maximum pressure limit of HST increases from 10 MPa to 38 MPa, the system operating cost decreases by 7.1%, and boots hydrogen storage capacity increases by 251.2%. Regarding HBF, when compared to a fixed hydrogen blending ratio (FHBR) of 20%, fluctuations between 0% and 15% lead to a 43% reduction in pipeline hydrogen content, a 28.9% rise in system costs, and increases in wind and solar energy curtailment rates by 6% and 23.9%, respectively. This study offers valuable insights into how HSTPL and HBF influence GEIES performance.

AB In light of the current integrated energy system (IES) transactions, the interaction between the supply and demand sides is not fully considered. With the overall development of the carbon trading market, there is a need to deeply explore the interests of multiple entities in energy trading under the step-by-step carbon trading mechanism. Therefore, research on the optimization and scheduling of multicomprehensive energy systems based on step-by-step carbon trading and hybrid games is proposed. Firstly, the interests and demands of various integrated energy systems and users in multi-integrated energy system energy trading should be comprehensively considered. Based on the master-slave game and Nash bargaining theory, an optimization model of multiple integrated energy systems is built under the step-by-step carbon trading mechanism and load aggregation, representing the interests of the entire user side. Secondly, the proposed game optimization model has been established to prove it can maximize social benefits. IES and user game optimization models have been established, with multi-IES being leaders with the goal of maximizing their own benefits, guiding the optimization between IES and load by formulating energy prices. Users are followers who aim to maximize comprehensive benefits and respond to IES's decisions through cooperation. Finally, using the improved gray wolf algorithm to solve the built model, it has been proven through comparison of calculation examples that the proposed method can reduce carbon emissions, effectively coordinate the optimization scheduling of multi-IES, and achieve the fair distribution of multi-IES cooperation benefits. This improves the effectiveness of individual and social benefits.

AB Integrated energy systems have become an important research topic in the pursuit of sustainable energy development. This paper examines regional integrated energy systems, presents the typical architecture of regional integrated energy systems, and builds an integrated energy system model. Two evaluation indexes are proposed: the integrated energy self-sufficiency rate and the expected energy deficiency index. Based on these evaluation indexes and taking into account the uncertainty of wind power generation, a bi-level optimization model based on meta-heuristic algorithms and multi-objective programming is established to solve the problem of regional integrated energy system planning under different load structures and for multi-period and multi-scenario operation modes. A quantum evolutionary algorithm is combined with genetic algorithms to solve the problem.

AB Hybrid energy storage system (HESS) has advantages in coping with the uncertainty of renewable energy and improving the stability of regional integrated energy systems (RIES). Few of the current HESS uncertainty scheduling methods consider both robustness and nonanticipativity, which may result in scheduling strategies that are not feasible in practice. Therefore, this research constructs a HESS (containing electric, thermal, hydrogen and natural gas storage devices) and forms a hybrid energy storage operator (IHESO) with an independent market position based on the HESS to provide energy services. Subsequently, a novel multi-stage distributionally robust optimization (MSDRO) method is established to maximize HESS revenue. Robustness and nonanticipativity can be satisfied in the uncertainty scheduling process of this method. After that, the stochastic dual dynamic integer programming (SDDiP) algorithm is introduced to solve multi-stage nested problems of complex systems. Finally, simulations are conducted in the actual system of three seasons and five scenarios. The conclusions are as follows: 1) The scheduling strategy provided by the MSDRO model and SDDiP algorithm can ensure effective operation based on satisfying robustness and nonanticipativity. 2) Compared with MSO, TSDRO and MSRO, the method proposed can improve the HESS economy and stability, increase renewable energy consumption and reduce carbon emissions.

AB Amid rising energy demands and environmental concerns, integrated energy systems (IESs) face conflicting interests. Conventional strategies of interest distribution face issues such as irrational resource allocation. Accordingly, establishing energy trading strategies with multiple stakeholders becomes essential. This paper proposes a robust optimization (RO) for IESs based on multi-energy trading to reduce energy trading cost. In this regard, a single-leader-multi-follower Stackelberg game is first modeled where IES acts as the leader, and the users and the electric vehicles (EVs) act as the followers. Secondly, this model is transformed into a single- layer linear model and integrated into the multi-stage RO. With this, the nonanticipativity in the two-stage RO can be effectively handled. Besides, by constructing multi-interval uncertainty sets for renewable energy, load, and electricity prices, the conservatism of the model is reduced, making the optimization results closer to actual condition. Noteworthy that the Nash bargaining method ensures a fair distribution of benefits among IESs and encourages them to participate in energy trading. Finally, the multi-energy trading model is solved using the prediction-correction-based alternating direction method with multipliers (PCB-ADMM) algorithm. The PCB-ADMM not only protects each IES's privacy but also has less execution time than the ADMM algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated through simulation using Matlab.

AB In this study, the multi-objective optimization considering renewable energy uncertainty and electric vehicles (EVs) is proposed for regional integrated energy systems (RIES), which can balance the economy and environmental friendliness of the system. Firstly, the influence of factors such as disordered access and charging/discharging of EVs on system operation is considered, an orderly charging and discharging model of EVs is established according to the driving laws. Then, a robust optimization model with polyhedral uncertainty set is constructed to handle the uncertainty of renewable energy output. Moreover, the minimizing operation cost and carbon emissions is developed as the multi-objective function, and the carbon emission penalty factor is introduced to convert the multi-objective into single objective solution. Finally, the validation is carried out by an actual RIES. The case studies verify the proposed method can well balance the economy and environmental protection of the system, and enhance robustness against the uncertainty while realizing the economic and optimal operation of the system.

AB The nearly-zero energy community composed of contiguously nearly-zero energy buildings can effectively reduce the operational energy consumption of buildings by adopting appropriate active and passive technologies, which is the main development direction of future buildings. However, there are few studies on the collaborative optimization of nearly-zero energy community supply systems. Therefore, a nonlinear cooperative optimization model of the regional integrated energy system with multi-region energy sharing and multi-energy storage is constructed in this paper. A two-layer collaborative optimization method is proposed, which optimizes the upper layer's renewable energy and energy storage capacity and the operation dispatching in the underlayer. Finally, the overall benefit, typical daily energy scheduling, and the energy sharing and storage impact on renewable energy utilization of the system when it supplies energy to a nearly-zero energy community are studied. The research results show that compared with the isolated integrated energy system, the supply cost, primary energy consumption, carbon emission and interactive power per unit area of the regional integrated energy system are reduced by 3.45 CNY/m2, 3.95 kWh/m2, 1.35 kg/m2 and 1.66 kWh/m2, respectively. In addition, multi-region energy sharing and multi-energy storage can effectively improve the self-consumption/sufficiency ratio of photovoltaic and wind power generation and solar thermal collector heat collection. This study provides a feasible solution for applying nearly-zero energy communities in regional integrated energy systems.

AB Although integrated energy systems (IES) are currently modest in size, their scheduling faces strong challenges, stemming from both wind generation disturbances and the system's complexity, including intrinsic heterogeneity and pronounced non-linearity. For this reason, a two-stage algorithm called the Multi-Objective Group Search Optimizer with Pre-Exploration (MOGSOPE) is proposed to efficiently achieve the optimal solution under wind generation disturbances. The optimizer has an embedded trainable surrogate model, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), to explore the common features of the multi-scenario search space in advance, guiding the population toward a more efficient search in each scenario. Furthermore, a multi-scenario Multi-Attribute Decision Making (MADM) approach is proposed to make the final decision from all alternatives in different wind scenarios. It reflects not only the decision-maker's (DM) interests in other indicators of IES but also their risk preference for wind generation disturbances. A case study conducted in Barry Island shows the superior convergence and diversity of MOGSOPE in comparison to other optimization algorithms. With respect to numerical performance metrics HV, IGD, and SI, the proposed optimizer exhibits improvements of 3.1036%, 4.8740%, and 4.2443% over MOGSO, and 4.2435%, 6.2479%, and 52.9230% over NSGAII, respectively. What's more, the effectiveness of the multi-scenario MADM in making final decisions under uncertainty is demonstrated, particularly in optimal scheduling of IES under wind generation disturbances.

AB The utilization of hydrogen-powered vehicles as an alternative to fossil-fueled ones has been identified as a promising solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To promote the deployment of hydrogen-powered vehicles, however, it is imperative that hydrogen refueling stations with on-site electricity-produced hydrogen (eHRSs) are economically utilized for concurrent services. Therefore, this article proposes a new estimation-based method for the optimal scheduling of eHRS for the provision of congestion management services to the distribution system. The method allows for real-time adaptive management of the congestion level in the feeder as decided by the distribution system operator. A new correlation-based method is proposed for online estimation of the amount of congestion and determination of the eHRSs setpoints to relieve congestion on the distribution feeders. This article also develops a congestion management pricing mechanism for the compensation of eHRSs that serve the distribution grid. Numerical results indicate how distribution feeder congestion can be adaptively managed, while the financial profile of the eHRSs is improved via joint application and provision of concurrent services to the transportation sector and grid operator.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB This study explores the critical challenge of balancing energy supply, investment efficiency, and profitability during the transition of natural gas enterprises into "natural gas+ " integrated energy systems. In a dynamic and uncertain environment, these systems face competing objectives: the carbon neutrality, resource optimization, and financial sustainability. To address these complexities, this study proposes a System Dynamics-Multi- Objective Programming (SD-MOP) model, grounded in the "Business-Production-Investment-Financial-Target" (BPIFT) framework, to integrate production, investment, and financial planning. The model incorporates SD to capture dynamic feedback among production, investment, and financial processes; MOP to resolve conflicting goals; Monte Carlo simulations to assess uncertainties across 200 scenarios; and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) to generate Pareto-optimal solutions. Results identify key variables, such as the Reserve Replacement Ratio (RRR) and Single Well Production (SWP), as critical for maintaining system stability. Scenario analyses demonstrate that the model balances competing objectives, achieving a 14% improvement in energy supply and a 19% increase in profitability, while highlighting the trade-offs between maximizing energy supply and profitability under manageable investment levels. Overall, these findings establish the model as a practical decision-making tool for integrated energy enterprises, aligning enterprise strategies with sustainability goals.

AB To explore the influencing factors of the integrated benefit (IB) index of integrated energy systems (IESs) and the best energy supply mode, we constructed a two-stage optimization model for planning allocation and operation scheduling. First, according to the structural characteristics of the energy demand load combined with the operation characteristics of each piece of equipment in the IES, a refined capacity allocation constraint model was constructed. Second, an IB optimization model with economic, environmental, and energy benefits as the optimization objectives was established. Then, by analogy with the price-based demand response (PBDR) and incentive-based demand response (IBDR) of the power system, an integrated demand response (IDR) model covering cooling, heating, electricity and gas was constructed. Finally, a citizen service center in Hebei Province, China, was used as a simulated example. The scientific capacity allocation of each device of the IES improved the economic efficiency by 14.8%. Compared with the traditional operation mode, the economic benefits of the multi-objective optimization (MOO) operation mode were increased by 2.97% and 3.42%, respectively. After further introducing the IDR, IB increased to 20.55 and 20.46%, and the effect of IBDR was better.

AB In the wake of the dual-carbon objective, the call for low-carbon attributes in integrated energy systems is ascending, with an amplified imperative to integrate wind and solar power efficiently. This study introduces an advanced low-carbon optimization framework for integrated energy systems, incorporating a sophisticated time-differentiated carbon accounting mechanism attentive to consumer emissions. A nuanced carbon accounting model is crafted to assess consumer emissions with greater accuracy. Predicated on these emissions, a refined low-carbon demand response model is articulated, factoring in the influence of carbon emission factors pertinent to electricity and heat procurement on user conduct. This model integrates the consideration of heat reclaimed from methanation processes, which in turn informs the carbon emission factors associated with purchased heat, and evaluates the subsequent optimization impact on the system. The proposed model is designed to curtail the system's operational expenditures and is operationalized via the CPLEX solver. Through the establishment of various scenarios for evaluative comparison, the model is corroborated to substantially augment the system's proficiency in assimilating wind and solar energy, markedly curtail carbon emissions, and facilitate a sustainable and cost-efficient operation of the integrated energy system.

AB As the global energy structure undergoes transformation and the low-carbon development process continues to advance, integrated energy systems have progressively emerged as crucial technical support for achieving sustainable development. In this paper, a joint-day optimal scheduling model is put forward considering the existence of dispatchable resources in community integrated energy systems (CIES). The aim is to cut down the system operation cost and enhance energy utilization efficiency. This model is founded on the concept of energy hubs and combines the shiftable, transferable, and reducible characteristics of demand-side flexible loads. It includes gas turbine power generation systems, energy storage, as well as wind and solar renewable resources. System operation cost and carbon trading cost are comprehensively taken into account, and ultimately, the CIES low-carbon economic dispatch model with the lowest total cost as the optimization objective is established. The Yalmip toolbox and Cplex solver are employed to solve the model. The optimization results of flexible electric and thermal loads participating in dispatching under different scenarios are analyzed through simulation. The economic benefits of electric and thermal independent dispatching are compared and analyzed, and the economic benefits of electric and thermal coupled dispatching are verified. The study reveals that the rational scheduling of user-side flexible loads can notably reduce operating costs, lower the load peak-to-valley difference and carbon emissions, and boost the comprehensive economic and environmental benefits of the system.

AB To enhance the economic efficiency and renewable energy integration capacity of multi-park integrated energy systems (MPIES) and address the issue of insufficient consideration of demand response uncertainty in existing studies, this paper proposes a distributionally robust optimization approach for multi-park integrated energy systems, considering shared energy storage and the uncertainty of demand response. First, models of the shared energy system and demand response are established. Based on these models, a deterministic optimization scheduling model for MPIES is developed, aiming to minimize system costs while considering constraints such as grid power balance. To address uncertainty in demand response, this paper employs Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Theory to construct uncertainty sets and considers system reliability constraints. The original optimization problem is then transformed into an equivalent robust counterpart model, and the optimal distributionally robust solution is obtained through parameter domain decomposition methods. Finally, the proposed method is validated using the IEEE 33-bus system. The results show that considering shared energy storage and demand response individually can reduce total system costs by 4.86 % and 26.46 %, respectively. After accounting for the uncertainty in demand response, the total system cost increases only slightly by 4.36 %, but this improves the system's robustness.

AB The research on the value evaluation system of power-to-hydrogen (P2H) equipment configuration in integrated energy systems is of great value for optimizing resource allocation, improving energy utilization efficiency, and promoting clean energy technology development. However, there is no comprehensive evaluation system for evaluating P2H equipment configuration in integrated energy systems. Therefore, a multi-dimensional value evaluation system is proposed to realize the thorough evaluation of P2H equipment with different capacity configurations in the integrated energy system. Initially, a mathematical model considering flexibility benefit, new energy consumption benefit, economic benefit, and environmental benefit is established to maximize the comprehensive benefits brought by P2H equipment to the integrated energy system, and the model is solved using an improved backbone particle swarm optimization (IBBPSO) algorithm; subsequently, a multi-dimensional value evaluation system based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) -entropy weight method is constructed, and the value of P2H equipment with different capacity configurations in the integrated energy system is compared and analyzed when the comprehensive benefit is optimal. The experimental results show that the IBBPSO algorithm exhibits better performance in solving the optimization model. Compared to PSO, IBBPSO, GWO, and WOA algorithms, it improves by 9.8%, 11.09%, 33.57%, and 17.7%, respectively. The optimal solution is achieved when the P2H equipment is configured to 50 MW.

AB Given the rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) ownership and the accelerated construction of novel energy systems, it is urgent to promote the integration of EVs and integrated energy systems (IESs). This study proposes a tri-level optimization model to optimize the operation and capacity of the IES with the orderly charging/ discharging (OCD) of EVs considering individual EV behavior. In which, the trip schedule and state of charge (SOC) demand of EVs is predicted by a spatiotemporal-SOC characterization model. Moreover, through the charging and discharging quote based on the trend of time-of-use tariffs to guide the OCD of each EV, the decoupling of the OCD decision-making and IES scheduling is achieved based on an interaction level and a precalculation method. Finally, this study optimizes the operation and capacity of the IES with the minimum operating cost and total cost, respectively. Following a simulation case study, the results show that the IES with OCD of EVs can reduce the operating cost by 12.1 % at the expense of 0.9% increase in equipment cost, which is significantly better than that with the electrical energy storage devices (EESs) which reduces the operating cost by 6.9% at the expense of 7.9% increase in equipment cost. Moreover, integrating the OCD of EVs with the EESs can reduce the operating cost by 17.9% and the final total cost by 7.4%. At the same time, EV owners in general not only achieve free charging but also receive an overall daily revenue of 613.3 CNY to supplement the additional battery degradation loss of EVs. This study also conducted uncertainty analyses on the number of EVs, battery capacity and charging/discharging power, and energy prices. Generally, this study investigates the economic and technical feasibility of integrating EVs with IES.

AB Integrated energy systems have attracted ample attention due to the fact that they increase the efficiency of the system and consequently reduce the environmental impacts. Among integrated energy systems, integration of a gas turbine (GT) with a multi-effect desalination (MED) and an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) has introduced itself as a potential option. In this paper, a comprehensive thermodynamic modeling of an integrated system consisting of a micro gas turbine, a single pressure heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), an ORC and an MED is conducted. Exergy and economic analyses are performed. In addition, a multi-objective optimization is performed to determine optimized design parameters. Moreover, an optimization is performed for different working fluids including R123, R134a and R245fa. The distilled water production and the total cost rate (power generation price) are considered as two objective functions. The fast and elitist Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is applied to optimize the objective functions simultaneously. The results show that MED evaporator approach temperature has a significant effect on the optimum selected power and distilled water capacity. Furthermore, by increasing compressor pressure ratio, the exergy efficiency increases and the cost rate decreases. Moreover, R134a shows the best exergy efficiency compared with other fluids.

AB Integrated energy systems, especially park-level ones, have attracted great attention since such structures lay the foundation of multi-energy complementary and cascade utilization of energy. Integrated energy systems for industries with associated multiple energy generated during the production process have not been explored. Here, we focus on the integrated energy systems for mine industry due to its high ecological requirements, i.e., the associated underground wastewater, mine gas, ventilation air methane, and geothermal should be sufficiently recycled and released as little as possible into nature. To this end, we first present a structure for coal mine integrated energy systems by integrating these forms of associated energy together with some flexible load. The multi-objective dispatch model of the system is then derived by considering the economic cost, carbon transaction cost for environment protection and degree of customer dissatisfaction for reducible and translational load. An enhanced evolutionary multi-objective algorithm by considering the time-series constrictions of the flexible load is further explored to efficiently obtain a set of solutions of the multi-objective dispatch. The presented algorithm is applied to a coal mine with multiple scenarios, and the results demonstrate the feasibility of our model and the effectiveness of the evolutionary multi-objective algorithm-based dispatch.

AB The operational phase of integrated energy systems (IESs), installed in distribution systems, is increasingly confronted with uncertainties in electrical consumption and output power of variable energy resource (VRE) (e.g., solar photovoltaics). One common approach to mitigate this challenge is to implement day-ahead (DA) scheduling based on cleared prices and purchased power. While this method is effective to some extent, it may not always provide the level of accuracy required. Another viable option is the application of incentive-based demand-response program (I-DRP), where adjustments to energy usage are made in return for a fixed tariff. Nonetheless, this method could result in monopolistic decision-making within an expanding energy industry, albeit assisting in alleviating the barrier. The complexity doubles as the nonlinear formulation of economic objective function is considered in the optimization stage. Hence, the optimality of the solution is a matter of concern. To address these challenges, this research introduces a two-stage coordinated strategy (TSCS) that combines accurate short-term forecasting of uncertainties and I-DRP with regulations of DA and real-time markets to identify the best possible offers and improves the operational efficiency of the IES. By conducting simulations on the IEEE 85-bus test system and comparing the results of the proposed algorithm with those of stochastic programming with fixed reward and penalty rates, our study demonstrates the reliability and accuracy of TSCS, highlighting the flexibility of offers in terms of customer's participation in the optimal operation of the IES.

AB Integrated energy systems (IES) have become a popular direction in the field of energy research due to their economic, efficient and environmental friendly advantages. Among them, multi-region integrated energy systems (M-RIES) are more valuable than single-region integrated energy systems (S-RIES) due to their low energy loss, high economy and reliability. At present, there is a lack of an optimisation method that integrates stationnetwork synergy, inter-station interaction, shared energy storage configuration, overall planning of equipment configuration and multi-timescale rolling for the multi-faceted performance enhancement of M-RIES. Therefore, this paper proposes an M-RIES with station-storage interaction and inter-station interaction under the consideration of station-network synergy, and conducts a study on the optimal configuration of M-RIES from the viewpoint of economy and environmental protection. The final analysis is based on a northern region. The results show that the system achieves an energy efficiency of 1.07, a 16.9% reduction in total station equipment configuration, a 3.87% reduction in cost and a 0.76% increase in new energy consumption rate compared to a stand-alone operating system. Taking one of the energy stations as an example, under the operating conditions of 10% intra-day and 5% real-time error, the multi-timescale rolling optimisation method significantly improves the energy supply rate compared to the day-ahead dispatching method, where the error rates for the three typical days of transition, winter and summer are only 0.43%, 2.56% and 0.06%, corresponding to a reduction of 5.02%, 2.49% and 5.06%, and a smaller cost error than the ideal solution The cost error rates for the three typical days are only 1.99%, 3.60% and 3.46%. In summary, the collaborative autonomous planning and operation method proposed in this paper has great advantages in terms of economy, reliability, energy efficiency and environmental protection.

AB Regional Integrated Energy Systems (RIESs) and Shared Energy Storage Systems (SESSs) have significant advantages in improving energy utilization efficiency. However, establishing a coordinated optimization strategy between RIESs and SESSs is an urgent problem to be solved. This paper constructs an operational framework for RIESs considering the participation of SESSs. It analyzes the game relationships between various entities based on the dual role of energy storage stations as both energy consumers and suppliers, and it establishes optimization models for each stakeholder. Finally, the improved Differential Evolution Algorithm (JADE) combined with the Gurobi solver is employed on the MATLAB 2021a platform to solve the cases, verifying that the proposed strategy can enhance the investment willingness of energy storage developers, balance the interests among the Integrated Energy Operator (IEO), Energy Storage Operator (ESO) and the user, and improve the overall economic efficiency of RIESs.

AB Integrated energy systems (IESs) can easily accommodate renewable energy resources (RESs) and improve the utilization efficiency of fossil energy by integrating various energy production, conversion, and storage technologies. However, the coupled multi-energy flows and the uncertainty of RESs bring challenges regarding optimal scheduling. Therefore, this study proposes an energy bus-based matrix-modeling method and a coordinated scheduling strategy for the IES. The matrix-modeling method can be used to formulate the steady- and transient-state balances of the multi-energy flows, and the transient model can clearly express the multi-time-scale characteristics of the different energy flows. The model parameters are fitted with data from experiments and the literature. To address the inherent randomness of the RESs and loads, a coordinated scheduling strategy is designed that contains two components: day-ahead optimization and rolling optimization. Day-ahead optimization uses the system steady-state model and multiple scenarios from the RES and load forecast data to minimize the operation cost while rolling optimization is based on the system's transient-state model and aims to achieve the optimal real-time scheduling of the energy flows. Finally, a case study is conducted to verify the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed model and optimization method. The results show that stochastic optimization reduces the total daily cost by 1.48% compared to deterministic optimization when considering the prediction errors associated with the RESs and loads, highlighting the stronger adaptability of stochastic optimization to prediction errors. Moreover, rolling optimization based on the system's transient-state model can reduce the errors between day-ahead scheduling and rolling correction.

AB There is a recognized need for treating the municipal solid waste which causes serious environmental problems. There has been substantial research undertaken on the role of municipal solid waste in integrated energy systems. However, the contribution of Taguchi technique has received little attention within the field of municipal solid waste-to-energy systems. This study set out to examine the capability of utilizing the Taguchi technique in optimization and evaluation of a tri-generation system based on gas turbine. L25 orthogonal array of Taguchi technique has been utilized considering compression factor of compressor, maximum temperature of input stream to the gas turbine, and municipal solid waste fed to the combustion chamber as the input variables. Electrical power of the system, heating air and water capacities of the system, system efficiency, and normalized emission have been also considered as the tri-generation system performance indicators. The air-based system operates optimally at compression ratio of 10, maximum temperature of 900 degrees C, and fed MSW of 1 mol/s while compression factor of 15, maximum temperature of 1000 degrees C, and fed MSW of 1.2 mol/s are optimum conditions for steam-based system. Overall, air-based system operates better than steam-based system with electrical power of 317.6 kW, heating air capacity of 678.4 m3/min, heating water capacity of 288.7 L/min, efficiency of 79.3%, and normalized emission of 8.58 g/kW.min.

AB Energy hubs function as advanced systems that transform, condition, and store various energy forms to meet demands for electrical power, heating, and hydrogen. The growing adoption of fuel cell-powered vehicles has increased the need for hydrogen refueling stations, which often rely on centralized energy hubs or renewable sources for electricity. Managing the joint operation of these systems within a microgrid, particularly under uncertainty, presents significant challenges. This study proposes a three-level, two-stage robust optimization framework to ensure the reliable and cost-effective operation of microgrids integrating energy hubs and hydrogen refueling stations. Unlike probabilistic methods, which rely on assumptions about the distribution of uncertainty, robust optimization enhances system resilience by addressing worst-case scenarios. The framework employs a Column and Constraint Generation (C&CG) algorithm, enabling computationally efficient optimization of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) models. The proposed framework is validated using a 69-bus renewable-dominated microgrid, demonstrating a 12.7 % reduction in operational costs and a 29.1 % improvement in system resilience compared to conventional stochastic methods. The study further evaluates scalability by applying the model to an expanded 118-bus network, achieving an 11.7 % cost reduction and 34.2 % higher resilience over the stochastic approach. Additionally, the robust optimization model improves renewable energy utilization by 33.3 % in the 69-bus system and 30.0 % in the 118-bus system, ensuring more efficient integration of wind and solar resources. These findings confirm that the proposed framework provides superior performance in handling uncertainties while optimizing microgrid operations. The results highlight the model's ability to reduce reliance on conventional energy sources, enhance storage utilization, and improve overall system reliability. This research offers a practical and scalable approach for managing integrated energy systems, supporting the transition toward more resilient and sustainable power networks.

AB Amidst the growing imperative to address carbon emissions, aiming to improve energy utilization efficiency, optimize equipment operation flexibility, and further reduce costs and carbon emissions of regional integrated energy systems (RIESs), this paper proposes a low-carbon economic operation strategy for RIESs. Firstly, on the energy supply side, energy conversion devices are utilized to enhance multi-energy complementary capabilities. Then, an integrated demand response model is established on the demand side to smooth the load curve. Finally, consideration is given to the RIES's participation in the green certificate-carbon trading market to reduce system carbon emissions. With the objective of minimizing the sum of system operating costs and green certificate-carbon trading costs, an integrated energy system optimization model that considers electricity, gas, heat, and cold coupling is established, and the CPLEX solver toolbox is used for model solving. The results show that the coordinated optimization of supply and demand sides of regional integrated energy systems while considering multi-energy coupling and complementarity effectively reduces carbon emissions while further enhancing the economic efficiency of system operations.

AB This paper proposes a cooperative multiple-objective approach for the sustainable economic scheduling of networked energy systems to simultaneously optimize the cost of energy and groundwater extraction from underground sources. The suggested strategy enables networked energy hubs to exchange electricity for greater financial gain. Various energy hubs collaborate to maximize gain that is fairly allocated among the hubs to guarantee the coalition's economic stability, according to the collaborative game theory. The coalition achieves its best gain through collaboration and payoff, which is equally and regularly divided among the hubs, according to the Shapley value. The suggested model takes into account a networked system with hubs connected to various types of energy, including electrical and natural gas, renewable energy sources, electrical, and thermal energy storages, combined heat and power units, and gas boilers, cooling, hydrogen, and water systems to meet demands. The numerical results show that the suggested cooperative approach reduces the cost function of the system by 12.71%. The self-discharging rate of battery storage devices can increase the cost function by $ 7.65. Also, the sensitivity analysis on the battery storage sizes demonstrated that they can reduce the total cost of the system by $ 15.65.

ID MARKET
AB With the development of integrated energy systems (IES), the traditional demand response technologies for single energy that do not take customer satisfaction into account have been unable to meet actual needs. Therefore, it is urgent to study the integrated demand response (IDR) technology for integrated energy, which considers consumers' willingness to participate in IDR. This paper proposes an energy management optimization method for community IES based on user dominated demand side response (UDDSR). Firstly, the responsive power loads and thermal loads are modeled, and aggregated using UDDSR bidding optimization. Next, the community IES is modeled and an aggregated building thermal model is introduced to measure the temperature requirements of the entire community of users for heating. Then, a day-ahead scheduling model is proposed to realize the energy management optimization. Finally, a penalty mechanism is introduced to punish the participants causing imbalance response against the day-ahead IDR bids, and the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) theory is introduced to enhance the robustness of the scheduling model under different prediction accuracies. The case study demonstrates that the proposed method can reduce the operating cost of the community under the premise of fully considering users' willingness, and can complete the IDR request initiated by the power grid operator or the dispatching department.

AB Hydrogen energy is playing an increasingly important role in integrated energy systems (IES) due to its multiple uses. Green hydrogen can be produced from electricity generated from renewable energy, reducing carbon emissions and environmental pollution. Previous work usually only considers electric vehicles (EVs) as flexible loads, and there are few studies on the production and application process of green hydrogen. In this paper, hydrogen electrolysis centers (HECs) and EVs are simultaneously schedulable loads, integrated into IES, and optimized. The distribution network model is established, and the optimization goal is to minimize network loss while ensuring the safe operation of the power grid. Through the power flow optimization method of mixed-integer second-order cone programming, the space optimization scheduling of EVs in the IES is carried out, and the optimal location of the HEC is reasonably planned and set. A simulation instance of IEEE 33 nodes is used to verify the proposed method. The final results show that this method can minimize network loss in the range of safe operation of the system for the spatial scheduling of electrolytic hydrogen centers and EVs. At the same time, it can also provide a reference for HEC addressing.

AB Hydrogen energy is recognized as a crucial solution for addressing energy crises and advancing energy conservation and emissions reduction. It will play a significant role in the future integrated energy systems (IESs). However, the influence of seasonal variations in scheduling optimization of hydrogen-integrated energy system has rarely been investigated. A low-carbon scheduling model for IES, adopting multiple demand responses and a ladder-type carbon trading mechanism, has been established. Additionally, a multi-time scale dispatch optimization strategy considering seasonal hydrogen utilization is thus proposed in this paper. Specifically, day-ahead scheduling optimizes the system taking into account the seasonal variations of renewable energy and load. In the intraday stage, rolling optimization is adopted to address the forecasting errors introduced by wind and photovoltaic fluctuations. In the real-time stage, chance-constrained methods are employed to ensure short-term supply-demand balance. The efficacy of the proposed strategy is verified using real-world measurements, and the results show the multi-time scale scheduling strategy and multiple demand responses effectively enhanced the system's self-regulation capability, leading to a 12% increase in renewable energy absorption. In addition, seasonal hydrogen utilization is essential for system design, as it enhances the absorption of renewable energy, reducing the purchase cost by 4% and the total cost by 2.6%.

AB Decarbonization is increasingly highlighted to realize emission peak and neutrality targets, while relevant low -carbon measures remain price high, especially for industrial end-users. This paper thus focuses on a specific design for park-level integrated energy systems with near-zero emissions. Solar photovoltaic and distributed wind power are applied as the main power supply together with the help of the local grid. The decarbonization sector is composed of power-to-gas (P2G) and carbon capture units where electrolyzers are separated from P2G and constitute the hydrogen subsystem together with hydrogen tanks and fuel cells. The system is also considered under the dynamic market environment where electricity, hydrogen, and emission exchanges are included. Then, the system behaviors are determined by an optimal operation model considering an uncertain power supply. Based on the stochastic operation, system configuration optimization considering economic and environmental objectives is constructed as a multi-objective integral model that is solved by an enhanced firefly algorithm in the first stage. Next, the optimal result is concluded according to subjective judgment and objective distribution in the second one. A case study in Gansu province, China is carried out to validate the system, and results indicate that 1) optimal result investing 5.285 million $ could avoid 7.4542 kilotons of emissions annually with a 20.1 % loss of self-power supply rate on average, 2) up to 51.72 kg of hydrogen fuels or 47.90 kg of gas could be generated besides daily load satisfaction, 3) carbon exchange incentive above 4.2 $/t could promote additional emission reduction.

AB The uncertainty of renewable energy makes the optimal scheduling of integrated energy systems (IES) challenging and complex. The paper suggests a novel two-stage optimized scheduling model based on distributionally robust adaptive model predictive control (DRAMPC), which effectively improves scheduling accuracy and efficiency while taking robustness and economy into account. In the day-ahead stage, the multi-objective distributionally robust optimization (MODRO) model is composed based on the imprecise dirichlet model (IDM), which incorporates robustness and operating cost metrics into the optimization objective to achieve synergistic optimization of robustness and economy. The adaptive step double-loop model predictive control (ASDL-MPC) utilizes the dual closed-loop feedback of renewable energy output prediction errors and operating cost prediction errors to adaptively adjust the rolling time step, correcting the day-ahead scheduling bias while improving scheduling efficiency. The model is resolved using the cross-entropy-radar scanning differential evolution (CERSDE) algorithm. The results show that the DRAMPC model can balance economy and robustness, improving the economy of IES by 2.27% while ensuring robustness. The ASDL-MPC intra-day rolling optimization further improves scheduling accuracy and also increases computational efficiency by 6.58%.

AB The introduction of energy conversion and storage devices, such as power-to-gas (P2G) and seasonal energy storage, can realize the multi-timescale electricity, heat and natural gas complementarity for integrated energy systems (IESs), promoting renewable energy consumption. However, this brings a large number of decision variables, strong coupling, and nonlinearity, increasing the complexity and difficulty of the optimal design for IESs. Therefore, this study proposes a generic triple-layer optimal design framework for IESs via coordination on multiple timescales. The proposed framework decomposes the optimal design of IESs into long-, medium-, and short-timescale optimization layers that are tractable. The long-timescale optimization layer realizes the seasonal source-load matching by incorporating a refined electricity-gas complementarity model; medium-timescale optimization layer utilizes the inter-day energy transfer to deal with extreme loads caused by rare weather conditions; and short-timescale optimization layer aims to realize real-time energy balances and gain economic benefits by intraday peak shaving. Each layer not only optimizes related capacity and operation variables jointly for its own timescale but also exchanges coupling information with adjacent layers via designed interactive iteration mechanisms. The implementation of the proposed framework is further investigated in the design of an electricity-gas-heating-cooling coupled IES. Finally, a case study is performed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed optimal design method. Simulation results show that the proposed method realizes source-load matching across multiple timescales, reducing the annualized total cost of the IES by 2.4 % and 3.3 % compared to the conventional single-timescale optimal design method under the grid connection and off-grid modes, respectively. The renewable energy consumption and device utilization rate of the optimized IES exhibit obvious improvements. In particular, the wind energy consumption of the IES increases by 15 times after introducing P2G and seasonal energy storage. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses indicate that the natural gas price considerably affects the optimization of the capacity configuration and economic performance of the IES, far exceeding that of the electricity price.

SO JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The integrated energy systems (IESs) in buildings locally supply energy to users and reduce the different types of energy loss during transmission. IESs are inexpensive and highly reliable. However, IESs must simultaneously meet the demands of multiple load types, consider the thermal inertia of energy transmission, meet user comfort requirements, and manage source and load uncertainties. We established a robust operational optimization model for building IESs considering multiple internal and external factors, such as the integrated demand response mechanism, user comfort, and consumption responsibility weighting. We also introduced information gap decision theory. We simulated and analyzed a demonstration project of a building IES, drawing the following conclusions: (1) The operating cost of the system was 32.66% lower in the system with than without the integrated demand response mechanism. (2) For the thermal inertia of buildings, a larger user comfort index or a larger equivalent thermal resistance led to a smaller user-side heating/cooling load demand. (3) The operating cost was 6.27% lower for the system with than without consumption responsibility weighting. (4) The operating cost of the system using the information gap decision theory to solve the operation optimization model was 10.61% higher than that obtained using the traditional fuzzy chance constraints theory, but the information gap decision theory was more flexible and indicative of operator risk appetite. This study provides guidance for promoting low-carbon operations, the green transformation of building integrated energy systems, and guiding operator energy supply strategies.

AB In this paper, a novel multi-objective optimization model of integrated energy systems (IESs) is proposed based on the ladder-type carbon emission trading mechanism and refined load demand response strategies. First, the carbon emission trading mechanism is introduced into the optimal scheduling of IESs, and a ladder-type carbon emission cost calculation model based on rewards and penalties is established to strictly control the carbon emissions of the system. Then, according to different response characteristics of electric load and heating load, a refined load demand response model is built based on the price elasticity matrix and substitutability of energy supply mode. On these basis, a multi-objective optimization model of IESs is established, which aims to minimize the total operating cost and the renewable energy source (RES) curtailment. Finally, based on typical case studies, the simulation results show that the proposed model can effectively improve the economic benefits of IESs and the utilization efficiency of RESs.

AB The introduction of hydrogen energy utilization will further highlight the high dimensionality, nonlinearity, and uncertainty of integrated energy systems, thereby increasing the difficulty of their scheduling strategy formulation. In this paper, a method based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning for optimizing the scheduling of integrated energy systems is proposed. Firstly, a comprehensive energy system model was established, integrating wind, solar, and hydrogen coupling to provide heating, cooling, and electricity. Subsequently, flexible model for proton exchange membrane fuel cells was developed, and its electrical and thermal output characteristics were analyzed. Four scheduling performance evaluation indicators were defined, and a reward function for deep reinforcement learning was constructed based on the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution approach. Combining the strategy of representing time series segment states and decision variable grouping training, the multi-agent twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradients algorithm was improved to establish a scheduling strategy learning model. Finally, a case study analysis is conducted to compare the proposed method with the baseline approach, confirming that the proposed approach significantly enhances the flexibility of scheduling strategies, ensures a balance between low-carbon emissions and economic efficiency, and ultimately improves the overall scheduling performance.

Besides, privacy protection is particularly important for a distributed control system, under the premise that calculation speed is guaranteed, meanwhile, privacy protection of all agents in an integrated energy system is also critical. This study uses annular directed distributed algorithm to enhance the privacy of integrated distributed energy systems in the intelligent body, so as to fully ensure the privacy safety of all agents in the system. Moreover, the forementioned difference Newton algorithm in this study avoid the behavior of Zeno, greatly accelerating the speed of iteration and finding the best energy market price,. At the same time, the privacy safety of all agentsin the distributed energy system are ensured. Finally, a distributed integrated energy system based on the algorithm proposed by this study has went through theoretical proof and simulation experiment, whose result shows the validity of the algorithm.

AB In the context of increasing global environmental pollution and constant increase of carbon emission, hydrogen production from surplus renewable energy and hydrogen transportation using existing natural gas pipelines are effective means to mitigate renewable energy fluctuation, build a decarbonized gas network, and achieve the goal of "carbon peak and carbon neutral"in China. Existing gas network modeling with hydrogen blended is divided into steady-state and dynamic. The steady-state modeling oversimplifies the physical process, while the dynamic modeling is computationally intensive. Thus, a quasi-steady-state modeling method of a hydrogen blended integrated electricity-gas system (HBIEGS) considering gas linepack is developed in this paper. The gas linepack refers to the gas stored in natural gas pipelines due to the compressibility of the gas. As a form of gas energy storage, linepack can enhance system flexibility by coping with wind power uncertainty. In the face of nonlinear gas flow equations in HBIEGS, conventional relaxation or approximate methods cannot provide a sufficiently feasible optimal solution. Therefore, a sequential second-order cone programming (S-SOCP) method is proposed to solve the developed model. It can effectively strike a balance between solution speed and the quality of the solution obtained. Finally, the modified IEEE-24-node power system and 12-node natural gas system are used to validate the effectiveness of the developed model and the proposed method. The optimization results show that the proposed method improves the computational efficiency by 91% compared with a general nonlinear solver.

AB Due to the advantages, such as being environment-friendly, the penetration of renewable energy has increased rapidly. However, the uncertainty and randomness of renewable energy source output severely impact economic dispatch, especially for those park-level integrated energy systems. To improve the economy of system operation and the accuracy of scheduling results, this paper presents a two-stage rolling dispatch strategy, in which a refined model of power flow, natural gas pipelines, and heat flow are established. The multi-energy flow model is linearized by the piecewise linearization method and second-order cone relaxation method. Moreover, a virtual energy storage model considering the thermal inertia in district heat systems and building enclosures is constructed. Further, to quantify the capacity of adjustable resources in park-level integrated energy systems, a multi-energy flexible source model is set up and integrated. Ultimately, to even out the prediction errors, a two-stage rolling dispatch is carried out, which corrects the results of day-ahead schedule plans. Based on the aforementioned works, case results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented approach, both in renewable energy accommodation rate (with a promotion of 13.3%) and system operation economy (with a reduction of 14.55% in operation costs). It is recognized that the constructed models play important roles in improving the system flexibility and the presented operation strategy can effectively enhance the accuracy of the dispatch plans in real-time operation.

AB To address energy waste and conflicts of interest among multiple park-integrated energy systems (PIES), a bilevel optimization model based on multi-agent game theory is proposed. In the upper-level model, cooperative games driven by economic relationships between districts determine the inter-district energy exchange, which is then passed to the lower-level model. The lower-level model establishes a multi-objective cooperative game for equipment scheduling, incorporating CO2 recycling through carbon capture systems and feedback for both carbon transmission and energy demand. Both levels of the cooperative game are decoupled and solved iteratively using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Finally, the Shapley value method is applied for profit distribution. The results demonstrate that multi-agent cooperation among districts significantly enhances the economic benefits of PIES, enabling flexible multi-energy scheduling and improving the overall economic efficiency of the energy system.

AB As extreme events such as natural disasters and cyberattacks become more frequent, the resilience of energy systems has become increasingly important. However, due to the growing interdependence between natural gas, district heating, and power systems, the resilience of energy systems is becoming more and more complicated. Typical challenges include conflicts in the restoration of heterogeneous energy systems due to infrastructure limitations and multiple uncertainties, such as renewable energy and outdoor temperature, during the system restoration. To address these challenges, we propose a novel combined electrical and heat load restoration (CEHLR) model for the heat and electricity-integrated energy systems. The CEHLR model is formulated as a bi-objective distributionally robust chance-constrained programming, which can coordinate the electrical and heat load recovery process and has strong robustness to uncertainties from renewable energy and outdoor temperature. Then, we convert the CEHLR model into an equivalent bi-objective mixed-integer second-order conic programming problem. Finally, we use a tailored normalized normal constraint method to obtain an evenly distributed Pareto frontier to facilitate the decision selection. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which also reveals the significant impact of the coupling between electricity and heat on the load recovery process.

AB Improving the energy efficiency and maintaining the energy balance of integrated energy systems is a common concern. This study investigated the optimal operation of combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) systems under conventional and impact load scenarios. For the conventional operation, a time-varying weight factor was proposed to calculate the multi-objective function to optimize the system scheduling under off-grid and grid-connected modes. For the impact load scenario, the characteristics of the energy storage device was reasonably utilized to stabilize the impact of power. The simulation results revealed that the establishment of the time-varying weight factor optimized the energy economy level of the CCHP system and significantly improved its energy efficiency. Particularly, the energy storage device can cut off the impact peak when the system is under continuous impact load, and improve the energy supply reliability of the system.

AB The increasing interdependence between electric power and natural-gas systems requires integrated simulation tools applicable to the coupled system. Therefore, this study proposes steady-state and transient simulation tools for electricity-gas integrated energy systems (IESs) by using convex optimisation. Steady-state IES simulation is designed for long-term planning studies while transient IES simulation, which includes line-pack storage, is designed for real-time operational research. The proposed convex steady-state gas flow model introduces binary variables to represent gas flow directions, and employs the second-order cone (SOC) to relax non-convex pipeline gas flow equations. As a result, steady-state gas flow analysis is formulated as a mixed integer SOC programming problem. The proposed transient gas flow model employs the implicit finite difference method to transform partial differential equations into algebraic difference equations. Moreover, the short-term gas flow directions are specified and SOC relaxations are used. Simulation results on an integrated IEEE 24-node system and Belgian 20-node gas system verify the effectiveness of the proposed SOC models. The impacts of wind power forecast errors on multi-period gas network operations are also investigated.

   system; Dual demand response; Energy management
AB The integrated energy system (IES) is one of the current hot topics in energy research field. However, simplifying models often assumes constant energy conversion device efficiency during optimized operation, which leads to impractical operating modes for the IES. Additionally, the outcomes of device outputs vary across different time scales. The inaccuracy and temporal dispersion of energy supply are becoming more and more prominent, and the modeling and optimal scheduling of the IES are facing great challenges. To effectively address these issues, a multi-timescale optimal scheduling strategy for integrated energy systems was constructed, which considers the variable operating conditions of the equipment. First, a dynamic energy hub model with iterative correction between the equipment efficiency and load rate was established. Subsequently, on this basis, a multi-time scale optimization model of day-ahead, intraday, and real-time dispatch was constructed. Further, a day-ahead and intra-day demand response strategy was introduced to encourage customers to actively participate in demandside management. Finally, a case study based on the energy system in the Xiongan area of China was conducted. From the optimization results, it was demonstrated that the proposed model in this work can solve the problem of inaccurate equipment efficiency in the fixed condition model and significantly improve the accuracy of system operation and dispatch. The implementation of a multi-time scale optimization and regulation strategy for IES can reduce the cost by 5.82%. Combined also with the dual demand response strategy, the total costs can be reduced by up to 10.07%.

AB Offshore micro integrated energy systems (OMIESs) are the basis of offshore oil and gas engineering and play an important role in developing and utilizing marine resources. By introducing offshore wind power generation, the carbon emissions of offshore micro integrated energy systems can be effectively reduced; however, greater challenges have been posted to the reliable operation due to the uncertainty. To reduce the influence brought by the uncertainty, a multiobjective optimization model was proposed based on the chance-constrained programming (CCP); the operating cost and penalty cost of natural gas emission were selected as objectives. Then, the improved hybrid constraints handling strategy based on nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (IHCHS-NSGAII) was introduced to solve the model efficiently. Finally, the numerical studies verified the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, as well as the validity and feasibility of the proposed model in improving the economy of OMIES under uncertainty.

AB Deployment of efficient, integrated energy systems can make a substantial contribution to reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Such systems are suitable for the provision of distributed energy supply in remote areas, and offer the advantages of compactness and operational flexibility. Also, the simultaneous production of multiple products provides the opportunity for Process Integration, thus leading to improved fuel efficiency and reduced carbon emissions. Process Systems Engineering methods can be applied for the synthesis of such sustainable energy systems. For example, process graph (or P-graph) models have previously been developed for synthesizing single-period polygeneration systems based on the Process Network Synthesis framework. In this work, a P-graph model for multi-period optimization of sustainable energy systems is developed. The model is able to synthesize flexible systems that can cope with changes in the availability of raw material supply and variations in product demand. In addition, the P-graph model is also capable of generating near-optimal solutions, which provide insights that may be significant to decision-makers, such as structural features that are common to a range of good solutions. Two case studies are presented to demonstrate the approach developed in this work. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID DEMAND RESPONSE
AB Integrated energy systems enhance renewable energy consumption and supply efficiency through optimized scheduling of energy production, conversion, and storage. This paper introduces a day-ahead stochastic-intraday robust two-phase multi-timescale rolling optimal scheduling model that addresses source-load uncertainty, improving renewable energy utilization and reducing operational costs. In the day-ahead phase, the model builds on traditional Monte Carlo simulation by updating the discrete probability density matrix based on the temporal characteristics of source-load data. It employs adaptive Monte Carlo simulation for generating source and load scenarios. Additionally, an improved k-means algorithm, utilizing the elbow method and considering the triangular inequality of Euclidean distances, enhances scene analysis efficiency and accuracy. In the intraday phase, the model incorporates slack variables and constraint sets, integrating them with a cardinality uncertain scenario set based on the traditional light robust optimization model. This approach reduces the conservatism typically associated with traditional robust optimization (RO) models. The proposed intraday multi-timescale rolling RO model facilitates efficient renewable energy consumption and balanced energy supply across various timescales. Overall, the findings demonstrate that the proposed model leverages multi-energy complementarities to optimize renewable energy consumption and ensure a balanced energy supply in a dynamic environment.

AB Multiple energy carrier systems stem from the need to evolve traditional electricity, gas and other energy systems to more efficient, integrated energy systems. An approach is presented, for controlling multiple energy carriers, including electricity (AC or DC), heat, natural gas and hydrogen, with the objective to minimise the overall cost and/or emissions, while adhering to technical and commercial constraints, such as network limits and market contracts. The technique of multi-agent systems (MAS) was used. The benefits of this approach are discussed and include a reduction of more than 50% in the balancing costs of a potential deviation. An implementation of this methodology is also presented. In order to validate the operation of the developed system, a number of experiments were performed using both software and hardware. The results validated the efficient operation of the developed system, proving its ability to optimise the operation of multiple energy carrier inputs within the context of an energy hub, using a hierarchical multi-agent system control structure.

AB A holistic analytical and smart management approach is proposed to investigate the performance of renewablebased tri-generation system to generate power, cooling, and domestic hot water with a simultaneous consideration of several operational, design, and system feasibility aspects in a framework. The proposed configuration consisted of a solar driven organic Rankine cycle, and double-effect absorption refrigeration cycle integrated with a Kalina cycle. To analyze environmental implications, life cycle assessments are performed, while further evaluations are conducted utilizing algebraic thermo-mathematical programming. Hazard study and thermal reliability analysis are also performed to analyze the safety and failure rate of the system. Additionally, four critical scenarios are defined: safe urban deployment, economic viability, reliable operation, and sustainable development. In accordance with the four specified scenarios the integrated system is globally optimized using a weighted multi-objective optimization. Following that, a suitable optimum system and fluid allocation is conducted based on hybrid deterministic decision-making technique under smart management. The optimization results showed that the total exergorisk, system reliability, and environmental impact can be simultaneously improved in the range of 4.08-28.3%, 4.14-13.9%, and 1.65-24.6%, in all scenarios employing various working fluids, respectively. Additionally, the system achieves lowest overall cost rate (4.17USD.s(-1)) with R113, while the highest energetic efficiency (46.3%) and system reliability of (91.2%) was associated with R365mfc. Finally, a comparative analysis indicates a CO2 saving potential of 6646, 4883, and 2878 tons/year in comparison to coal, fuel oil, and natural gas based integrated energy systems.

AB Coupling renewable energy power generation, electric vehicles, combined cooling heating and power system, and energy storage system is a new way for Community-Integrated Energy Systems (CIES) to shift to a low-carbon, highly efficient, environmentally friendly society, which is the key task in coordinating flexible demand response with multiple uncertainties in renewable energy. To this end, an integrated demand response program is used to explore the potential interaction ability of electricity-gas-heat-cool-Electric Vehicles flexible loads in a scheduling model based on chanceconstrained programming, based on which an integrated demand respond-enabled CIES with uncertain renewable generation was built, meanwhile, a ladder-type carbon trading mechanism was designed, and then the original model was transformed into a solvable mixed-integer linear programming model using Sequence Operation Theory and linearization methods. Furthermore, the objective function was constructed by using the deviation preference optimization strategy, daily comprehensive cost and daily carbon emissions were introduced to reflect the decision-makers' different optimization preferences by using weight coefficients as double optimization objectives. Finally, the simulation shows that CIES operation can effectively balance economy and reliability by setting an appropriate confidence level for the spinning reserve constraint, meanwhile, the comparative result shows that EV charging in the CIES has a very significant environmental benefit in carbon dioxide emissions reduction, while the number of EVs exceeds 500, EV charging in the CIES starts to show a better economic benefit.

AB A multi-energy microgrid has multiple terminal resources and multiple distributed components for energy production, conversion, and storage. By using this grid, an interconnected network with optimized multiple energy sources can be formed. This type of grid can minimize energy waste while laying the critical foundation for an energy Internet. The multi-energy microgrid must be formed properly to ensure multi-energy coupling and complement. However, critical technologies (e.g., reliability assessment) and configuration planning methods now need further research. In this study, a novel method for the reliability evaluation of a multi-energy supply is proposed, and an operation-planning double-layer optimization design method is investigated that considers reliability. On that basis, the effects of different configuration schemes on economy and reliability are quantitatively analyzed. First, the coupling relationship between multi-energy carriers in a typical multi-energy microgrid is analyzed; subsequently, the energy efficiency and economical models of the key equipment in the grid system are determined. Monte Carlo simulation and the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) method are applied to evaluate the reliability with sorted indicators. A double-layer optimization model is built for a multi-energy microgrid with the optimal configuration. The impact of configuration on the reliability and economical performance of the microgrid system is quantitatively analyzed based on actual calculations. The results obtained here are relative to the capacity, configuration, operation, and energy supply reliability of the multi-energy microgrid, and may serve as the feasible guidelines for future integrated energy systems.

AB This paper presents a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of the world's first large-scale commercial Powerto-X (PtX) plant in Kass & oslash;, Denmark. This innovative facility combines solar photovoltaic (PV), an electrical grid, green hydrogen production, methanol synthesis, and district heating in an integrated system. We conduct an indepth analysis to explore optimal operating conditions, the potential for sector coupling within the power and heat sectors, and the economic feasibility of the integrated system. In particular, we study different scenarios considering changes in solar PV power generation, electricity market price, CO2 price, and methanol price to explore their impacts on the system performance. Our results show that the electrolyzer's operation, a pivotal component of the system, heavily depends on the electricity spot price as well as the methanol price. Based on the green production of methanol, a premium price of 4800 DKK/t (0.64 <euro>/t) is considered in this study (selling price of 8400 DKK/t). The results show that in case of high electricity prices (2022 spot market) or no premium price for methanol, the optimum annual production of methanol decreases by 58% and 67%, respectively. Furthermore, we observe that the variability of solar power output significantly impacts the plant's performance and economic viability, as it supplies about 30% of the plant's power consumption. Although the results are unique to the Kass & oslash; plant, the study's techniques and insights can be applied to other comparable systems around the world. The study also highlights how crucial it is to take market, climate, and technical factors into account when developing and running integrated energy systems.

ID CERTIFICATES; POWER
AB The low-carbon economic operation of integrated energy systems (IES) cannot be separated from the carbon trading and green certificate trading market. Therefore, a low-carbon market mechanism and optimization method for IES is proposed. First, we establish a "green-carbon" offset mechanism to realize the conversion from tradable green certificate (TGC) to carbon quotas to offset system's carbon emissions. Second, considering the impact of market incentives and users' consumption behavior on IES, an energy management method of IES is put forward based on Stackelberg game. IES operators as leaders decide energy prices and trading strategies of carbon, TGC and multi -energy. Energy users as followers participate in the integrated demand response based on energy price. The game is solved by an improved adaptive catastrophic genetic algorithm and CPLEX solver. Finally, we take an industrial park in China as an example to analyze. The results show that the proposed method can significantly reduce the system's carbon emissions while improving the benefits for both IES and consumers.

AB This paper presents a novel green combined heat and power generation system for industrial applications. It composes of a hydrogen-fueled combined cycle power plant and a battery energy storage. Firstly, the hydrogenair rich mixture enters the combustion chamber of the gas turbine cycle for generating electricity, while recovering the heating energy from the exhausted flue gases for driving a steam turbine cycle. The heating energy extracted from the condenser heat exchanger is also used to supply the heating demand of the end-user. Moreover, a comprehensive thermodynamic model and analysis of H2 combustion process is provided to estimate the adiabatic flame temperature based on enthalpies of reactants and products. The optimum operating point of the cogeneration system is found by solving a mixed-integer nonlinear problem using MATLAB and GAMS over a 24-h study horizon aiming to minimize its daily operation cost considering all technical constraints of system components and load-generation balance criterion. It is found that the energy efficiency of the hydrogen-fueled combined cycle changes from 46 to 58 % while generating 11.331-12.982 MW electricity and 4.436-4.984 MW heat. Two cases are studied without and with participation of battery in energy procurement strategy. It is demonstrated that the objective function of the optimization problem improves from 18 $ cost in case 1 to 29 $ revenue in case 2.

AB Energy Hubs (EHs) play an important role in sustainable cities; they are multi-carrier energy systems that can satisfy different energy needs of consumers by relying on the conversion and storage of energy sources as well as renewable energy sources. With efficient and reliable energy supply, EHs may significantly contribute in developments of sustainable cities. In this paper, day-ahead scheduling of EHs is done, while they are connected to demand response aggregators. The studied EH includes photovoltaic and wind renewable sources, biomass, hydrogen electrolyzer, combined heat and power unit, solar heater, boiler, electric, thermal and hydrogen storage systems. Besides electric grid and gas network as input sources, EH may purchase electricity from demand response aggregators. Information gap decision theory (IGDT) is employed as a risk-aware method to handle uncertainties of electric, thermal and hydrogen demands, photovoltaic and wind power, solar heat and electricity prices. The scheduling is carried out from the perspective of the uncertainty free, risk-averse and riskseeking decision-makers. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer model and is solved using CPLEX solver in General algebraic modeling system (GAMS). The impact of risk awareness and deviation factors of critical and target costs on day-ahead scheduling and EH operation costs is investigated. The results show that the transaction with demand response aggregator decreases EH operation cost by 20.1%. The results also show that electric, thermal and hydron storage systems respectively decrease the operation cost by 3, 1.7 and 2.1%.

AB As an essential part of the future national energy system, hydrogen energy has the advantages of clean, long-time scale energy storage and good complementary characteristics to electrical power, making it an important player in the low-carbon transformation of energies. However, the long timescale storage characteristics and tradability of hydrogen energy are rarely considered in existing capacity allocation optimization methods for hydrogen integrated energy systems(HIES). Meanwhile, the impact of the physical characteristics of the hydrogen storage equipment is rarely considered in the construction of HIES. Therefore, this paper proposes a new capacity allocation method for HIES in industrial park considering hydrogen trading and long-term hydrogen storage. The proposed capacity allocation optimization method is a bilevel mixed-integer linear programming model, which is solved by the reconfiguration decomposition algorithm. The nonlinear constraint problem due to the physical characteristics of the hydrogen storage device is solved by the Big-M method and the binary method. The proposed method can effectively improve the economy of HIES and reduce the cost of hydrogen production. Meanwhile, the reconstruction decomposition algorithm can effectively solve the bilevel mixed integer programing model. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce hydrogen production economics by 28%. Considering hydrogen trading, the total investment and operating cost of HIES is reduced by 25%, while long-term hydrogen storage can reduce the cost of hydrogen production for HIES and reduce the impact of hydrogen trading fluctuations.

AB The establishment of the concept of sustainable, decentralised, multi-carrier energy systems, together with the declining costs of renewable energy technologies, has proposed changes in off-grid electrification interventions towards the development of integrated energy systems. Notwithstanding the potential benefits, the optimal capacity planning of such systems with multiple energy carriers-electricity, heating, cooling, hydrogen, biogas-is exceedingly complex due to the concurrent goals and interrelated constraints that must be relaxed. To this end, this paper puts forward an innovative new optimal capacity planning method for a first-of-its-kind stand-alone multiple energy carrier microgrid (MECM) serving the electricity, hot water, and transportation fuel demands of remote communities. The proposed off-grid MECM system is equipped with solar photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, a hydrogen-based energy storage system-including an electrolyser, a hydrogen reservoir, and a fuel cell-a hybrid super-capacitor/battery energy storage system, a hot water storage tank, a heat exchanger, an inline electric heater, a hydrogen refuelling station, and some power converters. The main objective of calculating the optimal size of the conceptualised isolated MECM's components through minimising the associated lifetime costs is fulfilled by a specifically developed meta-heuristic-based solution algorithm subject to a set of operational and planning constraints. To evaluate the utility and effectiveness of the proposed method, as well as the technical feasibility and economic viability of the suggested grid-independent MECM layout, a numerical case study was carried out for Rakiura-Stewart Island, Aotearoa-New Zealand. Notably, the numeric simulation results highlight that the optimal solution presents a low-risk, high-yield investment opportunity, which is able to save the diesel-dependent community a significant 54% in electricity costs (including electrified space heating)-if financed as a community renewable energy project-apart from providing a cost-effective and resilient platform to serve the hot water and transportation fuel needs.</p>

AB The analysis of energy configuration in the planning of data-center-park-integrated energy systems (DCP-IESs) has become an enormous challenge, owing to multi-energy complementarity, energy cascade use, and energy security. In this study, a configuration model of DCP-IESs was established to obtain the economic and low-carbon energy uses of the data centers, based on mixed integer linear programming. In the model, carbon emissions were converted to economic indicators through carbon pricing. Then, the configuration model was modified according to the security of the proposed device switching logic, and the Markov-based reliability estimation method was used to ensure the redundant design of the configuration. Using the new energy configuration method, the DCP-IES configuration scheme could be obtained under economical, low-carbon, and high reliability conditions. A data center park in Shanghai was selected as a case study, and the results are as follows: it will only take 2.88 years for the economics of DCP-IES to reach those of traditional data center energy systems. Additionally, the use of configuration model in DCP-IES would result in a reduction in annual carbon emissions of 39,323 tons, with a power usage effectiveness of 1.388, whereas an increase in reliability results in an increasingly faster increase in the initial investment cost.

AB To realize the cascaded utilization of energy, improve the effective utilization of energy, and further reduce the carbon emissions of integrated energy systems a robust stochastic low-carbon optimal dispatch model with economy, environmental protection and reliability is developed for a park-integrated energy system wherein the multiple uncertainties brought by source and load are fully considered. First, a two-stage robust optimization algorithm is employed to handle uncertain wind power generation. A multi-case analysis method for the uncertainties of photovoltaics and load is proposed based on an improved centralized reduction algorithm. Then, considering the depreciation of the weighted average of the comprehensive operation cost, carbon emissions, and energy undersupply rate, a robust stochastic optimal dispatch model can be derived and efficiently solved by using a multi-objective fuzzy optimization algorithm with an improved membership function. Finally, by comparing the four cases, the simulation results show that the computational complexity and calculation time of the system can be reduced, the trimming result errors can be decreased, and a balance between economy, environmental protection, reliability, and robustness can be achieved.

AB Because of highly increasing energy consumption, environmental issues and lack of common energy sources, the use of renewable energy sources especially wind power generation technology is increasing with significant growth in the world. But due to the variable nature of these sources, new challenges have been created in the balance between production and consumption of power system. The hydrogen energy storage (HES) system by storing excess wind power through the technology of power to hydrogen (P2H) and delivering it to the electricity network through hydrogen-based gas turbine at the required hours reduces not only wind alternation but can play an important role in balancing power production and consumption. On the other hand, power consumers by participating in demand response (DR) programs can reduce their consumption at peak load or wind power shortage hours, and increase their consumption at low-load or excess wind power hours to reduce wind power spillage and system energy cost. This paper proposes a stochastic security constrained unit commitment (SCUC) with wind energy considering coordinated operation of price-based DR and HES system. Price-based DR has been formulated as a price responsive shiftable demand bidding mechanism. The proposed model has been tested on modified 6-bus and 24-bus systems. The numerical results show the effect of simultaneous consideration of HES system and price-based DR integrated with wind energy on hourly generation scheduling of thermal units. As a result there is some reduction in wind generation power spillage and daily operation cost. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Uncertainties can affect the operation and planning of integrated energy systems. It is thus critical to understand how uncertainties can be handled in IES optimization. To address this issue, this study proposed a novel integrated stochastic programming-information gap decision theory (IGDT) approach, which can handle multiple uncertainties in the optimization of IES operation and planning. By applying the integrated approach to an office building, two sides of operation schedules and equipment capacities were generated, representing the risk-averse and risk-seeking strategies, respectively. The EES capacity under the risk-averse strategy is smaller than that under the risk-seeking strategy, while the TES capacity is larger under the risk-averse strategy. The consumption of fossil fuels is critical for dealing with uncertainties. Adjusting the operation of the gas turbine, energy storage units, and grid interaction are useful approaches for handling uncertainties and resisting associated risks. Through the comparison between the integrated approach and a two-stage stochastic approach, it is found that the proposed integrated method ensures the accuracy of the results and, at the same time, provides flexible options for system developers and operators regarding various uncertainties and associated risks.

AB Integrated energy systems (IESs) have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to the high energy efficiency and low emission of carbon dioxide. To deal with the limitation of single IES, distributed energy networks consisting of multi-IESs are proposed to improve the complementarity of both the energy supply and the demand. This paper mainly focuses on the day-ahead energy management of the whole energy network for the economic operation of the system, following which, a cooperative game is formulated to determine the optimal strategy of each IES to minimize the coalition daily cost. Meanwhile, an allocation mechanism is designed from the perspective of probability to allocate coalition cost to each IES. According to the results of the numerical study, the proposed approach can improve the economic performance of both the energy network and the individual IES by interchanging electrical and thermal energies in the network.

AB As a small energy system, microgrid plays an important role in utilizing distributed energy resources, improving traditional energy networks, and building intelligent integrated energy systems. However, microgrid manage-ment is always a challenging optimization problem due to different factors. Meta-heuristics have been widely used to solve complex optimization problems in many fields, including energy systems. However, there is a lack of a systematic summary of the application of meta-heuristics in microgrid management. This paper aims to review the application of meta-heuristics in microgrid management, summarize the contributions and influences of different methods, and provide further insights and suggestions for future research.

AB The liquid carbon dioxide energy storage system (LCES), as a highly flexible, long-lasting, and environmentally friendly energy storage technology, shows great potential for application in integrated energy systems. However, research on the combined cooling, heating, and power supply using LCES in integrated energy systems is still limited. In this paper, an optimized scheduling scheme for a low-carbon economic integrated energy system is proposed, coupling LCES with power-to-gas (P2G) technology and the green certificate/carbon trading mechanism. Mathematical models and constraints for each system component are developed, and an optimization scheduling model is constructed, focusing on the economic and low-carbon operation of the integrated energy microgrid system. The objective function aims to minimize total system costs. A case study based on a northern China park is conducted, with seven scenarios set for comparative optimization analysis. The results demonstrate that the use of the combined cooling, heating, and power LCES system reduces total costs by USD 2,706.85 and carbon emissions by 34.57% compared to the single-energy flow operation. These findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed model in optimizing system costs and reducing carbon emissions.

AB This study addresses the optimization of urban integrated energy systems (UIESs) under uncertainty in peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity trading by introducing a two-stage robust optimization strategy. The strategy includes a UIES model with a photovoltaic (PV)-green roof, hydrogen storage, and cascading cold/heat energy subsystems. The first stage optimizes energy trading volume to maximize social welfare, while the second stage maximizes operational profit, considering uncertainties in PV generation and power prices. The Nested Column and Constraint Generation (NC&CG) algorithm enhances privacy and solution precision. Case studies with three UIESs show that the model improves economic performance, energy efficiency, and sustainability, increasing profits by 1.5% over non-P2P scenarios. Adjusting the robustness and deviation factors significantly impacts P2P transaction volumes and profits, allowing system operators to optimize profits and make risk-aligned decisions.

AB Existing energy management methods for integrated energy systems are mostly in distributed communication and computation now, need a large number of iterations, and each time of iteration needs lots of communication and computation. For this reason, on one hand, the iteration may cause energy-delay. On the other hand, iteration will significantly increase the communication and computation burden. The integrated energy systems contain a variety of devices and energy resources (including renewable energy resources), so the communication and computation burden is already very high. If the communication and computation cannot be solved very well, the cost functions of each device need to be much easier to ensure the operation of the system and their systematic error will be much larger. For this reason, the result of optimization will be much worse because of the accuracy of cost functions. The greatest challenge of this issue is to establish an algorithm without iteration. For handling this issue, first, we adopt the theoretical demonstration to prove that if all prices of all devices are the same, the optimization will be realized and the instantaneous price is the one-order derivative. (we assume the relationship between the operating cost and the energy flow of each device as the convex cost functions.) Second, we reshape all cost functions. Third, we change the function to the total of the foregoing functions in the directed annular path and adopt the total function of the hole system to solve the energy price. Last, we use the price to ensure their operating condition. Our theoretical demonstration has already proved the optimization, convergence, the plug and play performance, scalability, and the emergency scheduling performance of the annular partial differential algorithm (APDA).

ID POWER
AB The low-carbon development of integrated energy systems is achieved via the sharing of multiple energy interactions by park-level IES (PIES).However, coordinating profit distribution conflicts among complex interactive stakeholders in stochastic scenarios is challenging. Accordingly, this study proposes a novel tri-layer framework that aggregates different game mechanisms to investigate the interactions between PIESs and coupled energy markets. First, a linkage trading mechanism is proposed by integrating carbon emissions trading and green certificate trading, which establishes a coupled electricity-carbon-green certificate market. Consequently, a park aggregation operator acts as an intermediary between PIESs and the coupled market, setting upper-level purchase and sale prices to guide unit generation in each PIES using the Stackelberg game theory. Subsequently, the Nash game theory is applied to realize cooperative bargaining among PIESs for a fair revenue distribution. Further, the impact of uncertain environments is considered by utilizing stochastic scenario methods and the conditional value-at-risk theory. To protect the privacy of each participating agent while improving the convergence speed, a differential evolutionary method is combined with analysis target cascading to solve the framework. Finally, the proposed scheduling method is validated by utilizing a typical case to optimize conflicting PIES interests in multiple scenarios and realize decarbonisation.
   This study developed a trilayer framework based on hybrid games for implementation in power grids to improve energy-use efficiency, carbon-capture cycles, and resource sharing for maximum equitable revenue. Through the integration of different gaming methods and transaction mechanisms, a rational distribution of benefits among complexly interacting stakeholders can be achieved. It will aid in the improvement of energy management systems by effectively managing energy sources, storage mechanisms, and resource-sharing.image

AB Building multi-energy complementary integrated energy systems (IES) is a crucial way to achieve the goal of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality. However, uncertainties at both the source and load ends pose particular challenges to the optimal design and operation of the system. This paper proposes a multi-stage stochastic planning model considering CO2, NOx, and SO2 emissions and multiple uncertainties. The k-means algorithm was used to obtain typical scenarios and typical parameters of the reference building. The uncertain scenarios with probability distributions are generated by Latin hypercubic sampling and backward curtailment method. Then, a novel multi-objective sand cat swarm optimization (MOSCSO) algorithm is proposed for solving the upper-layer design model. The lower layer scheduling model is constructed as a mixed-integer linear programming model, and the solver is invoked for optimization. A case study validates the proposed model. Compared to different operating strategies, the two-layer optimization model can achieve a maximum of 13.54 %, 12.38 %, and 21.73 % improvement in economic, energy, and environmental. Compared to electricity price uncertainty, the sensitivity analysis suggests that gas price uncertainty negatively impacts the system. In addition, the twolayer optimization model under a single uncertainty provides the best economic, energy, and environmental compared to the operational strategies.

AB In integrated energy systems (IESs) with high share of renewable energy, converting excess electrical energy into hydrogen (H2) and mixing it with natural gas (NG) offers numerous advantages and has become a key research focus. However, IES operations are influenced by various factors, such as equipment performance, energy flow dynamics, and load management, which are often overlooked in traditional optimization approaches. This study develops a novel hydrogen-compressed natural gas (HCNG)-IES model and operational strategy to address these challenges. An equivalence framework is established between electricity and hybrid gas, enabling the creation of an equivalent circuit model integrating electricity, heat, HCNG, H2, and NG. This model captures the intricate interactions and dependencies amongst energy equipment, multi-energy flow, and consumption loads. An optimized operational strategy is proposed, leveraging variable H2 content in the gas mixture and adaptable thermal loads, while accounting for the energy inertia of H2 storage and building systems to maintain supply-demand balance. Case studies reveal that incorporating HCNG technology increases renewable resources utilization, reducing operational costs, carbon emissions, and primary energy consumption by 23%, 24%, and 23%, respectively. Moreover, compared to conventional NG-IES optimization focused solely on equipment output, the proposed HCNG-IES approach achieves reductions of 28.12% in costs, 24.36% in carbon emissions, and 39.13% in primary energy consumption.

AB This study proposes an optimal scheduling method for complex integrated energy systems. The proposed method employs a heuristic algorithm to maximize its energy, economy, and environment indices and optimize the system operation plan. It uses the k-means combined with box plots (Imk-means) to improve the convergence speed of the heuristic algorithm by forming its initial conditions. Thus, the optimization scheduling speed is enhanced. First of all, considering the system source and load factors, the Imk-means is presented to find the typical and extreme days in a historical optimization dataset. The output results for these typical and extreme days can represent common and abnormal optimization results, respectively. Thus, based on the representative historical data, a traditional heuristic algorithm with an initial solution set, such as the genetic algorithm, can be accelerated greatly. Secondly, the initial populations of the genetic algorithm are dispersed at the historical outputs of the typical and extreme days, and many random populations are supplemented simultaneously. Finally, the improved genetic algorithm performs the solution process faster to find optimal results and can possibly prevent the results from falling into local optima. A case study was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can decrease the running time by up to 89.29% at the most, and 72.68% on average, compared with the traditional genetic algorithm. Meanwhile, the proposed method has a slightly increased optimization index, indicating no loss of optimization accuracy during acceleration. It can also indicate that the proposed method does not fall into local optima, as it has fewer iterations.

AB Integrated Energy Systems (IES) serve as an effective solution to address grid fluctuations. However, mainstream IES still adhere to established supply strategies such as thermal and electrical non-conversion (TENC), heat determined by power (HDP), and power determined by heat (PDH). These strategies overlook the additional flexibility generated by the synergy between electricity and heat, preventing the full realization of their advantages in supporting the grid. This paper proposes a Flexible Scheduling (FS) operational strategy for IES that maximizes the utilization of flexibility resources to meet the demands of heating, cooling, and electricity while maintaining grid stability. The superiority of this strategy is analyzed through an IES multi-objective optimization scheduling model and a comprehensive flexibility margin model. The results of a case study indicate that the FS strategy reduces total costs by 19.9% compared to TENC, 16.6% compared to HDP, and 5.2% compared to PDH. It exhibits the strongest support for the grid, increasing the overall flexibility margin of IES by 40.5% compared to TENC, 12.7% compared to HDP, and 8.2% compared to PDH. The FS-based IES operational strategy proposed in this paper contributes significantly to the flexible and economical operation of IES.

AB Extreme disasters have become increasingly common in recent years and pose significant dangers to the integrated energy system's secure and dependable energy supply. As a vital part of an integrated energy system, the energy storage system can help with emergency rescue and recovery during major disasters. In addition, it can improve energy utilization rates and regulate fluctuations in renewable energy under normal conditions. In this study, the sizing scheme of multi-energy storage equipment in the electric-thermal-hydrogen integrated energy system is optimized; economic optimization in the regular operating scenario and resilience enhancement in extreme disaster scenarios are also considered. A refined model of multi-energy storage is constructed, and a two-layer capacity configuration optimization model is proposed. This model is further enhanced by the integration of a Markov two-state fault transmission model, which simulates equipment defects and improves system resilience. The optimization process is solved using the tabu chaotic quantum particle swarm optimization (TCQPSO) algorithm to provide reliable and accurate optimization results. The results indicate that addressing severe disaster situations in a capacity configuration fully leverages the reserve energy function of energy storage and enhances system resilience while maintaining economic efficiency; furthermore, adjusting the load loss penalty coefficients offers a more targeted approach to the balancing of the system economy and resilience. Thus, new algorithmic choices and planning strategies for future research on enhancing the resilience of integrated energy systems under extreme disaster scenarios are provided.

AB As the reliance on natural gas to meet electric generation requirements increases, additional operational measures and risks must be considered to better understand the implications of the complex interdependency between the natural gas system and the power system. This paper develops a novel interval optimization framework of contingency-constrained unit commitment for integrated energy systems. Uncertainties in contingencies are captured by interval numbers, which reduces the computational burden compared with other uncertainty representations. Moreover, we incorporate the risk preferences of decision makers in the framework to alleviate the conservativeness of solutions. It is observed that power-to-gas technology can reduce renewable curtailment and offer auxiliary services. Numerical results demonstrate the economic value of power-to-gas in integrated energy systems.

AB Large-scale integrated energy systems often encompass several subsystems divided by geographic areas. Coordinated operation of multi-area integrated energy systems can enhance operational flexibility, which is crucial for systems with high wind power penetration. Traditional centralized methods have some inherent defects, such as privacy protection, communication burden, and computational capability, etc. To address such challenges, this paper proposes a decentralized computation method for the robust operation of multi-area joint regional-district integrated energy systems with uncertain wind power. The interconnected multiple areas can cooperate for improved system flexibility and wind power integration capability. Using the decentralized method, the area operator optimizes its operation decisions independently without transferring its dispatch rights. The shared information is limited to exchanged energy flows. The proprietary information is thus preserved while the communication burden is significantly reduced. To solve the robust operation problem distributedly, the decentralized method is enhanced to cope with both deterministic and robust problems. A tri-level algorithm composed of the iterative alternating direction multiplier method and the column constraints generation method is utilized to realize the decentralized optimization. Numerical results for three test systems show the effectiveness, computational quality, and scalability of the proposed method. Compared to the isolated method, the proposed method fully utilizes the coordination effect of multi-area RD-IES and has obvious economic advantages, especially in scenarios with high wind power penetration levels. The proposed method brings a 12.4% cost reduction in the two-area system and a 22.4% cost reduction in the eight-area system.

AB As an emerging multi-energy consumption subject, data centres (DCs) are bound to become crucial energy users for integrated energy systems (IES). Therefore, how to fully tap the potential of the collaborative operation between DCs and IES to improve total energy efficiency and economic performance is becoming a pressing need. In this article, the authors research an optimization coordinated by the energy scheduling and information service provision within the scenario of an integrated energy system with a data centre (IES-DC). The mathematical model of IES-DC is first established to reveal the energy conversion process of the electricity-heat-gas IES and the DC's energy consumption affected by the scale of active IT equipment. For dynamical providing multi-energy and computing service by coordinating scheduling energy and information equipment, the formulations of IES-DC scheduling, which is described as a Markov decision process (MDP), are presented, and it is solved by introducing the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3), which is a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. Finally, the numerical studies show that compared with benchmarks, the proposed method based on the TD3 algorithm can effectively control the operation of energy conversion equipment and the number of active servers in IES-DC.
   In contrast with traditional IES scheduling methods where only the flows of multiple energy and the operating condition of energy equipment are considered, an IES-DC framework is presented where the conversion processes of multi-energy are displayed, and the energy consumption of information infrastructure is formulated. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first work that constructs the state space of DRL models with the operating condition of integrated energy systems and data centres and realizes the synchronous and coordinated scheduling of both, optimizing the operating cost and computing services provision of IES-DC. image

AB The application of integrated energy systems (IES) in urban areas is gradually increasing, yet the constraint of limited building space poses a significant challenge to effective system planning. In this paper, to address the issue of area limitation from the perspective of improving solar energy utilization. A novel IES utilizing solar spectral beam splitting (SBS) for hydrogen production is proposed, which introduces SBS technology to make full use of the sun's full-spectrum energy. Furthermore, the incorporation of photocatalytic hydrogen production introduces an innovative approach to meet the hydrogen needs of hydrogen refuelling stations, facilitating highly efficient co-generation of cooling, heating, electricity, and hydrogen supply. To determine the optimal system configuration, a comparison is made with a stand-alone solar system using a honey badger-simulated annealing optimization algorithm. The results show that the SBS-IES achieves a solar energy utilization rate of 37.72% and reduces equipment footprint by 20.48%. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is performed to analyse the impact of changes in floor space on the system. This innovative system is suitable for small-scale IES and serves as an efficient solution for urban energy systems.

AB Source-load output uncertainty poses significant risks to the stable operation of Integrated Energy Systems (IESs). To ensure safe and stable system operation while optimizing the balance among robustness, economic viability, and low-carbon emissions, this paper presents a two-stage robust optimal scheduling model for IESs. This model is supported by hydrogen-containing electric dual-energy conversion characteristics under source-load uncertainty. Additionally, to promote the low-carbon characteristics of the system, a ladder carbon trading mechanism is introduced on the source side of the carbon source equipment. Furthermore, the integration of hydrogen energy enhances the clean characteristics of source-side multi-energy coupling. The proposed utilization mode, Power-to-Hydrogen, Hydrogen-to-Power, Hydrogen Energy Storage, and Hydrogen Load (P2H-H2P-HES-HL), allows for bidirectional conversion, thereby increasing the flexibility and responsiveness of overall system scheduling. Finally, to ensure that the model closely reflects actual operational and scheduling conditions, a twophase robust approach is employed to address source-load uncertainties. This approach is solved iteratively using the linear transformation of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and the Column-and-Constraint Generation (C&CG) algorithm. The results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly enhances the scheduling capability of the system in coping with uncertainty, thereby effectively ensuring its flexibility and security.

AB Traditional energy systems pose a significant threat to human social development due to fossil fuel depletion and environmental pollution. Integrated energy systems (IESs) are widely studied and applied due to their clean and low-carbon characteristics to achieve sustainable development. However, as integrated energy systems expand, their impact on ecosystems becomes more pronounced. This paper introduces the concept of the ecological damage index (EDI) to promote the sustainable development of integrated energy systems. Moreover, the introduction of a capacity tariff mechanism will impact the energy structure, making it essential to consider its effects on capacity allocation within integrated energy systems. This paper proposes a multiobjective optimization framework for constructing a capacity planning model for integrated energy systems, focusing on achieving a multidimensional balance between the economy, environment, and ecosystem using the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. Finally, the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is employed to optimize the three objectives and obtain the Pareto frontier solution set. The optimal solution is selected from the solution set by combining the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and Shannon entropy method. In comparison to scenarios with incomplete considerations, the multiobjective capacity optimization model proposed in this study exhibits significant improvements across the three metrics of cost, carbon emissions, and the ecological damage index, with a 19.05% reduction in costs, a 26.24% decrease in carbon emissions, and an 8.85% decrease in the ecological damage index. The study demonstrates that the model abandons traditional single-objective research methods by incorporating a multidimensional balance of the economy, environment, and ecosystems. This approach forms a foundational basis for selecting the optimal energy mix and achieving sustainable development in integrated energy systems. The life cycle assessment methodology evaluates impacts across all stages of integrated energy systems, providing a comprehensive basis for assessing and planning the sustainable development of the systems. The study offers guidance for the rational allocation of the integrated energy system capacity and advances the sustainable development of such systems.

AB The multiple uncertainties in renewable energy generation and load pose challenges for the operation of integrated energy systems (IES) with robustness. To achieve robust scheduling of IES, this paper proposes a multiobjective bi-level confidence gap decision theory robust model (MOCGDT). First, a neural network-based surrogate model is used to obtain the inverse cumulative distribution function of a Gaussian mixture model for uncertain parameters, constructing a confidence interval uncertainty set. Then, the upper-level optimization objective is to maximize the fluctuations of wind, solar, and load, while the lower-level objective is to minimize the total operating cost, resulting in an IES MOCGDT robust model. Finally, an effective bi-level solution algorithm is developed for the model's characteristics. The case study results demonstrate that the proposed method improves economic costs by 20.69% and 3.87% compared to robust optimization and stochastic optimization, respectively, and reduces computation time by approximately 601 s compared to stochastic optimization. This suggests that the proposed MOCGDT model not only reduces the conservatism of conventional robust decisionmaking but also overcomes the coarseness of uncertain sets in the information gap decision theory model, achieving more reasonable robust scheduling with uncertainty. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are thus verified.

AB Integrated energy systems (IES) with renewable energy systems (RES), carbon capture systems (CCS) and energy storage systems (ESS) are considered efficient in supporting the low-carbon energy supply with both economic and environmental benefits. Effective energy management is required to ensure the economical, environmental and reliable operation of the IES. However, the optimal IES operation is considered a non-trivial task due to the renewable generation uncertainty and the optimization of multiple contradictory objectives (e.g. economic, environmental and risk costs). This paper aims to provide a multi-level optimization model for the real-time optimal IES operation consisting of RES, ESS and CCS. This work quantifies the uncertainty by the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) theory in the optimization model. The uncertainty is further reduced by improving the operation strategy through a model predictive control (MPC)-based method. Also, the multi-objective optimization model is adopted to minimize the economic cost, carbon dioxide emissions (CDE) and primary energy consumption (PEC) for optimal energy scheduling in the intra-day stage. Based on the result of the intra-day stage, the feedback correction model is applied to adjust the schedule to balance the difference between the forecasting and actual values. Numerical results show that the proposed solution can provide the trade-off between economical and environmental performance. Through ablation experiments, the proposed method with feedback correction can carry out demand response with lower costs, CDE and PEC. The proposed solution is further confirmed with outperformed performance compared with single-objective optimization methods and other stochastic optimization methods. In addition, a robustness analysis is conducted to quantify the benefits of RES, ESS and CCS in IES.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB With the development trends of carbon neutrality, carbon trading is graduating embedded into the energy management of integrated energy systems (IESs). The dual benefices of carbon emission reduction and economics can be achieved by coordinatively optimizing the complementarity and flexibility between multiple IESs. However, this leads to the increased complexity of the market transactions, which poses significant challenges in terms of the benefits distribution among multiple entities, the convergence of trading processes, and the privacy -preserving issues. The multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is capable of solving complex sequential -decision problems and acquiring the optimal strategies for each entity through the interactions between the multiple agents and the market. The MARL deployed on the local agent can provide online trading decisions for individual market entities considering their own interests, which offers new potential to solve the above -mentioned difficulties. In this paper, we proposed an IESs co-trading market including electricity, natural gas and carbon trading. The multi-agent energy management coordinative optimization problem is solved by an improved Multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm to achieve fair trade and entity privacy protection. The case study results verify that the proposed optimal energy management strategy based on the improved MADDPG algorithm can efficiently guide the IESs in the energy and carbon co-trading market.

AB To reduce carbon emissions and improve the energy efficiency of energy systems, integrated energy systems (IESs) have been promoted in recent years. However, the data of different energy networks cannot be fully shared. The data privacy protection is attracting more attention in demand side. It is difficult for centralized dispatching strategies, which must obtain all the data of energy systems during optimization, to be applied. To solve these issues, a cloud-edge collaborative distributed optimal dispatching strategy for electric-gas IESs is proposed in this paper. The centralized IES scheduling problem is reasonably divided into multiple subproblems. Considering information barrier, the cloud computing centers are separately set in different energy networks to solve energy flow optimization subproblems. Considering prosumer privacy protection, edge computing units are separately set in energy hubs to deal with cost and carbon emissions minimization of regional integrated energy systems (RIESs). Based on the proximal Jacobian alternating direction method of multipliers, the common optimization variables interactive iteration and parallel solution of multiple dispatching models are developed. The simulation results show that the proposed distributed optimization method can achieve the same accuracy as the centralized optimization method and improve problem-solving efficiency in general.

AB By multi-objective optimization of designing integrated energy systems for buildings, the Pareto frontier can be obtained consisting of a series of optimal compromise solutions. Since all solutions on Pareto frontiers are non-dominated, it is challenging to identify one "best of the best" solution, which requires posteriori multi-criteria decision-making. However, most existing research only presented the obtained Pareto frontiers, while neglected the decision-making. Therefore, this paper compares four posteriori decision-making approaches in recent publications by solving one identical problem to emphasize the importance of decision-making. An illustrative Pareto frontier is generated by two multi-objective optimization approaches, i.e., eps (epsilon)-constraint and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). Four categories of multi-criteria decision-making methods, i.e., Shannon entropy, Eulerian distance, fuzzy membership function and evidential reasoning, are further implemented. The decision-making results are different when various approaches are applied. The underlying reasons are analyzed including two key factors, i.e. selection of objectives and shape of Pareto frontier, which provides suggestions of using decision-making approaches in future multi-objective optimization research on building energy systems.

AB Effective equipment capacity planning and energy scheduling are vital for improving the economic efficiency, energy savings, and carbon reduction of integrated energy systems (IES). The current independent IES planning overlooks interactions among multi-stakeholders across regions, resulting in suboptimal designs. Coordinated planning of multi-regional IESs can leverage spatial-temporal characteristics and resource complementarities to improve efficiency and allocation. However, uncertainties in both supply and demand introduce fluctuations that threaten system stability, and the absence of an effective energy-sharing mechanism complicates optimal configuration and scheduling. To address these challenges, we propose a decentralized framework for coordinating multi-regional IES configuration and scheduling under uncertainty through energy sharing. This framework incorporates uncertainties in supply-side output, load demand, and seasonal distributions, constructing a two-stage three-layer robust optimization model. A decentralized coordinated optimization framework, based on cooperative games, facilitates supply-demand interactions among regional IESs, with the Nash bargaining method for benefit allocation. The solution process uses the Column-and-Constraint Generation algorithm to decouple the main problem and subproblem for faster computation, while the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers algorithm ensures distributed solving and protects participant privacy. Results demonstrate that the model mitigates uncertainty impacts, enhances the energy system's economic and environmental performance, and fosters long-term stakeholder cooperation.

ID STRATEGY
AB Multi-carrier energy hubs (MCEHs) are an innovative concept capable of meeting various types of energy demand simultaneously. MCEHs involve numerous components, many of which have varying degrees of uncertainty. Therefore, a detailed model is essential for managing the energy needs of MCEHs while addressing these uncertainties. This paper proposes a novel MCEH optimization model that incorporates renewable energy resources and addresses the uncertainty associated with an electric vehicle parking lot (EVPL), renewable energy generation, and multi-energy consumption, assessing their impacts on the operational cost of the hubs. The model considers three types of energy inputs: electrical power, gas, and water, corresponding to three types of demands met by various resources. Furthermore, the hubs are capable of trading electrical energy with each other and with the external grid. To reduce carbon emissions, hydrogen vehicles and EVs are utilized, enhancing the operational efficiency of the multi-hub system. This study models the uncertainty of EVPLs, renewable energy generation, and multi-energy consumption using a stochastic, scenario-based approach. An interval-based approach is employed to address the uncertainty of retail electricity prices. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-energy, multi-hub management strategy, achieving a 19.48 % reduction in operational costs. However, the mean overall operational cost increased by 2.54 %.

AB By participating in demand response programs, building users can provide energy flexibility for the power grid while earning economic benefits for themselves. However, the win-win situation described above is often challenged by the presence of ineffective demand response, over-target demand response and under-target demand response, which pose risks to the economic returns of building users and the stable operation of the grid. To this end, this study proposes a risk-averse transaction optimization strategy to offer bidding schemes and operational strategies that effectively balance the effectiveness of demand response with operational economic benefits. First, a novel model for calculating incentive subsidy is developed, which takes into account the power grid's requirements for demand response effectiveness, as well as differentiated subsidy and penalty mechanisms. Then, a risk-averse optimal dispatch model for building integrated energy systems is established. By collaboratively optimizing the declared response quantity and operation strategies, this method reduces the risk of incentive subsidy loss faced by building users and enhances demand response effectiveness. Lastly, the proposed models are applied in the power market of Shenzhen, China, and the effectiveness of the method is assessed based on three key performance indicators: incentive subsidy loss rate, operating cost reduction rate, the actual load response rate. The results indicate that the total incentive subsidy loss rate is reduced from 37.16 % to 17.75 % through the application of the risk-averse optimal dispatch model proposed in this paper, with operating cost savings ranging from 3 % to 8.09 %. More importantly, the effectiveness of demand response is significantly improved, with the proportion of effective response duration increasing from 18.60 % to 65.93 %. The proposed method is further validated by adjusting the penalty coefficient. Findings show that the risk-averse method provides more robust results and provides more reliable bidding schemes for declared response quantity.

AB A new reliability assessment approach to Integrated Energy Systems (IESs) is introduced in this paper. The optimal load curtailment (OLC) algorithm and reliability assessment algorithm are both improved in the proposed approach. For the OLC problem, this paper develops a hierarchical decoupling optimization framework for both the energy hub optimal dispatch and the optimal power flow problems. This feasible solution can make the OLC calculation more efficient and accurate. For the reliability assessment algorithm, an impact-increment based state enumeration (IISE) method is accommodated for IESs to accelerate the reliability assessment process. Also, a reduction technique of higher order contingencies is presented for the reliability evaluation of IESs to further enhance the computational efficiency. Case studies are performed on an IESs test case combined the IEEE-33 bus system with 14-node gas system and a practical case combined the IEEE 118-bus power system with Belgian natural gas network Numerical results demonstrate the efficient and robust performance of the proposed approach. Besides, the impacts of energy conversion process and energy hubs on IESs reliability are analyzed in detail.

AB Energy management and suitable sizing are regarded as major concerns at the time of designing integrated energy systems. Finding an efficient framework that combines sustainable design, reliable operation and lifetime cost at minimal level is essential for society, customers and investors. In this regard, a novel multi-objective optimization model for the design of integrated energy system with electric, thermal and cooling subsystem is established to simultaneously minimize the economic, technical and environmental objectives. It aims to obtain the optimal sizing of each component such as photovoltaic panels, wind turbine, battery energy storage system, combined cooling, heating and power generation system, heat storage tank, gas boiler and electric chiller considering system performance in economics, system autonomy and carbon emissions. A hybrid energy system in residential area is taken as a case study to demonstrate the application of the proposed method, the Pareto front of the multi objective problem is obtained via NSGA-II method, and four design plans on the Pareto front selected by Topsis method are analyzed and discussed. Such analysis show that the optimum solution could effectively reduce both the economic and environmental impacts of the integrated energy system as well as improve the system autonomy towards main grid. And the comparison about the results illustrated the reliability of the optimization model in this paper. This study demonstrates the high capability of the proposed design optimization in supporting economic design, improving autonomic operation and reducing the carbon emissions, meanwhile meeting multiple loads.

AB At present, it is very important to build the new power system with new energy as the mainstay. Some Regional Integrated Energy Systems (RIES) have installed renewable energy generation equipments with wind turbines and photovoltaics as the main power supply facilities. Due to the volatility in the wind turbine, photovoltaic output power and the customer's electricity load, there is energy waste in the RIES. In order to enhance the economic and renewable energy consumption rate of the park where the RIES is applied, an integrated energy system(IES) planning optimization model is constructed,which considers the mixed storage differentiation characteristics. The model expands the hybrid energy storage system(HESS) on the basis of the original RIES. A two-stage decomposition model combining wavelet packet decomposition method and power decomposition method based on discrete Fourier transform is established, in which the difference between power generation of renewable energy and customer load is decomposed. Depending with the difference in response speed of energy storage devices, the power of different frequencies is moderated. With the comprehensive energy system econ-omy as the goal, the genetic algorithm based on elitist preservation strategy is adopted to optimize the planning model and verify the correctness of the model through simulation. The results show an improvement of 8.23 % and 23.79 % in economy and renewable energy consumption rate compared to the RIES before the HESS expansion.

AB As the rapid development of natural-gas fired units (NGUs), power systems begin to rely more on a natural gas system to supply the primary fuel. On the other hand, natural gas system contingency might cause the nonavailabifity of NGUs and inevitably jeopardize power system security. To address this issue, this paper studies security-constrained joint expansion planning problems for this combined energy system. We develop a computationally efficient mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach that simultaneously considers N-1 contingency in both natural gas system and electricity power system. To reduce the combinatorial search space of MILP models, an extension of a reduced disjunctive model is proposed to decrease the numbers of binary and continuous variables as well as constraints. The involving nonlinear terms in N-1 constraints are exactly linearized without sacrificing any optimality. Numerical results on two typical integrated energy systems demonstrate the necessity of extending N-1 criterion to the whole network of a combined energy system. Experimental results also show that compared with the conventional approach, our proposed MILP approach achieves a great computational performance improvement in solving security-constrained co-optimization expansion planning problems.

AB To reduce fossil-fuel consumption and improve the efficiency of renewable energy usage in the manufacturing industry, several studies have investigated the environmental and economic impacts of integrated energy systems under various optimization scenarios. To analyze the cost-effectiveness of heat supply scenarios for a typical manufacturing industry using the photovoltaic (PV) technology and municipal solid waste incineration, herein, a metal-assembly paint factory was selected as the research target. The CO2 emission and energy-consumption cost of a paint factory in 24 h are estimated as 31,229 kg and 12,314 CNY, respectively. Solar-to-Energy (StE (a-d)) and Waste-to-Energy (WtE) correspond to the nonenergy-storage, heat-storage, PV power-storage, PV technology's green power-procurement, and waste-incineration district heating scenarios, respectively. The results show that (1) under the nonenergy storage (StE(a)) scenario, the emissions of the paint factory can be reduced by 288 kg/24 h; however, the operation cost is increased by 1142 CNY/24 h (2) StE(b) has a better economic performance (cost reduction by 2472 CNY/24 h) than StE(c) (cost increased by 1546 CNY/24 h). Additionally, the reduction in the CO2 emissions in StE(b) (12,057 kg/24 h) is considerably higher than that of StE(c) (7644 kg/24 h). (3) In the case of sufficient energy supply, StE(d) (24,361 kg/24 h) reduces CO2 emissions more effectively, followed by WtE (CO2-emission reduction = 17,994 kg/24 h), than the other scenarios (for a paint factory). However, from the perspective of cost reduction, WtE showed to have a more outstanding performance (cost reduction 1428 CNY/24 h).

AB To achieve efficient energy utilization and reduce systemic carbon emissions, this paper presents a multitimescale, low-carbon optimal scheduling strategy for an integrated energy system (IES) with a high degree of coupling among combined heat and power (CHP), carbon capture systems (CCS), power-to-gas (P2G), and hydrogen energy. It is developed with a stepped carbon trading mechanism. First, the study analyzes the characteristics of the coupling model and offers an optimized model of the operational management processes associated with hydrogen energy. Then, to promote the integration of hydrogen energy in the novel energy system, the analysis evaluates the impacts of hydrogen-fired power generation, under varying fixed hydrogen doping ratios, on the low-carbon and economic performance of the IES. It further explains the related mechanisms. Finally, to minimize source and load prediction errors on optimal system scheduling, the study proposes a day-ahead low-carbon optimal scheduling model. Case study results confirm that the proposed model and strategy enhance the operational the IES flexibility by facilitating multi-system coupling across electricity, heat, gas, and hydrogen. This enhanced ability to utilize multiple, complementary energy sources improves both the utilization of renewable energy sources and the economic and low-carbon performance of IES.

AB The role of gas-fired power generators in capturing the intermittency of renewable energy resources is crucial. Also, sustaining the natural gas network performance while transferring the unpredictability of renewable energy resources to the natural gas grid caused the integrated operation of power and natural gas grids to be essential in future smart grids. On the other hand, current studies that have examined the combined operation of electricity and natural gas systems have mainly focused on the operational constraints of both networks, and a few considered market-based frameworks such as the peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading method for the integrated operation of both grids. Employing the P2P energy trading market framework can improve the integration of different distributed energy resources (DERs), such as gas-fired generators with power systems, through its competitive market-clearing price. Also, paradigms such as the P2P energy markets are conceptualized to improve the power system performance (voltage security) by introducing local energy transactions. In this regard, considering the power grid constraints in the P2P energy trading market is crucial. Using the natural gas network to support power grid operation may reduce gas network reliability. Hence, considering natural gas grid limitation (nodes gas pressure) in integrated energy systems operation is fundamental. This paper presents the P2P energy-sharing optimization model for the integrated operation of natural gas and power networks, considering the natural gas network steady-state model, the power grid limitations (the AC power flow), and the distribution power grid's usage fees. Employing the P2P energy transaction framework facilitates customers' (gas turbines and microgrids) energy trading with each other. The presented P2P optimization is equipped with a Thevenin impedance distance (TID) model to reflect the power distribution usage in customers' energy transactions as a grid usage price. The simulation results reveal that the presented method can considerably reduce the total operating cost, improve customers' social welfare, and enhance both grids' performance.

AB This study develops a three-stage energy management system (EMS) for renewable energy microgrid operation. The core of this framework is based on a unit commitment problem integrated with model predictive control (MPC) to address the problem of uncertainty in renewable sources. Meanwhile, it is shown that an MPC approach may be insufficient to fully address the hurdles for optimal and safe operation of wind power-integrated energy systems due to the severity of wind speed fluctuations within even short time intervals. Spinning reserve resources can have a positive impact to ensure a reliable operation, yet their availability is highly dependent on the existence and capacity of dispatchable energy sources, such as diesel generators, in energy systems. Consequently, a supplementary Constrained Information Gap Decision Theory approach is utilised in this study to optimise the system's robustness against severe uncertainty of wind generations. In order to evaluate the presented framework, a descriptive index is first introduced, and then the model is applied to an isolated microgrid. The results indicate that by deploying these three stages, the renewable energy support index increases, ensuring an optimal, reliable, and safe operation.

Therefore, this study investigated the effects of off-design characteristics on the operation and configuration of integrated energy systems, both singly and collectively. To this aim, a two-stage optimization framework was applied to optimize the operation and configuration of IES. The off-design characteristics include the electric-thermal correlation of gas turbines (GTs), the load rate-efficiency correlation of gas boilers (GBs) and absorption chillers (ACs), and the temperature-efficiency correlation of heat pumps (HPs) and electric chillers (ECs).When off-design characteristics are considered, the optimal capacities of the energy conversion equipment tend to increase and system costs would increase. For all system equipment, the capacity of the EC increases by 515.4% and the system cost increases by 7.3%. Regarding system operation, the effects of off-design characteristics on the operation of the GT and AC are most significant for all energy conversion equipment. The electric energy storage (EES) and the thermal energy storage (TES) help to reduce the capacity of the GT and system cost. When off-design characteristics are considered, their effects are magnified.

AB The uncertain operating state of integrated energy systems (IESs) increases significantly with the ever-increasing renewable energy penetration. In order to evaluate the operation state of IES more reasonably, this paper pro-poses an interval energy flow (IEF) method and applies it to an IES that utilizes hydrogen as an energy conversion carrier. Firstly, a steady-state energy flow model for an electricity-heat-hydrogen system is presented. Then, the parallelogram model is employed to describe the correlation between interval variables to acquire more accurate results. Furtherly, combined with the above two models, the IEF is transformed into minimum and maximum optimization models. Due to the complexity of nonlinear optimization calculation, the interval solution is pro-cured by the alternating iterative method based on linear optimization and deterministic energy flow for the sake of accuracy and simplicity. Finally, a case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, and a detailed discussion about the impact of correlation on interval solutions is given. The calculation speed of the proposed method is 6.5 times faster than Monte Carlo simulation. The interval ranges of state variables are narrowed significantly after considering correlation, with a maximum narrowing range of up to 63.08%.

AB In recent years, zero-carbon energy resources such as adiabatic compressed air energy storage with thermal energy storage have been interested due to growing concerns over global warming. This study proposes a microenergy grid including heat and power networks connected through adiabatic compressed air energy storage with thermal energy storage, which can be considered hybrid energy storage supplying power for both networks. The power network is supplied with the main grid and wind turbine systems, and the heat network is provided with heat pumps. The objective function minimizes power purchased from the main grid and power demand of heat pumps in the heat network. Since uncertainty plays a key role in the operation of integrated energy systems, the uncertainty of intermittent parameters such as active and reactive load and wind speed data has been considered in this study. Therefore, predicted values are used in the optimization problem instead of using deterministic values for such uncertain parameters. To do this, an efficient 2-level corrective forecasting algorithm is proposed to have an accurate prediction for the day-ahead operation of the microenergy grid. Different scenarios are presented to show the importance of the forecasting method and the utilization of adiabatic compressed air energy storage with thermal energy storage in the system's structure. The results indicate that corrective actions on the predicted load and wind speed data decrease the operation cost of the microenergy grid from 57.13% to 13.21%. Also, it is found that neglecting adiabatic compressed air energy storage with thermal energy storage in the structure of the microenergy grid increases operation cost to 3423 US$. Other obtained results also indicate the importance of coutilization of compressed air energy storage with thermal energy storage and 2-level corrective forecasting method leading to optimal operation of the microenergy grid.

AB With the increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RES), and energy storage systems (ESS), energy management has become a critical issue. Grid owners are already considering systems such as power-to-gas (P2G), which allow excess electricity from renewables or batteries to be converted to gas and sold back to the gas grid. The presence of distributed gas production systems and P2G leads to interaction between electricity and gas networks. This turns energy management and profit optimization into a complex task that requires a combined approach. This study examines the optimization of integrated energy systems to find the efficient solutions. Considering the uncertainty in renewable energy production and energy prices, a robust min-max-min approach has been adopted. Demand-side management (DSM) is also critical for optimal operation of the power grid. It significantly reducing peak loads and increasing profits. This paper presents a two-stage mixed integer second order cone programming (MISOCP) model for the joint optimization of electricity and gas networks, including distributed generation (DG), P2G systems, ESS, electric vehicles (EVs), and DSM. To address the computational challenges, this study uses the column generation and constraint (C&CG) algorithm. The proposed model is tested on a distribution grid of IEEE-33 bus system and shows its effectiveness in different scenarios. Key findings include: 1) DSM successfully reduces grid peak loads, 2) renewables and batteries enable the conversion of excess electricity into gas for sale in the marketplace, and 3) DG buys energy from the upstream grid resulting in a 21 % cost reduction.

AB Instability in supply and demand, coupled with conflicting market interests, significantly impacts the operational efficiency, reliability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability of integrated energy systems. To address this issue, an operation strategy for a community integrated energy system based on Stackelberg game theory is proposed, taking into account the characteristics of supply and load. Initially, a master-slave game model for an integrated energy system is established, with energy marketer acting as leader and energy supplier and load aggregator as followers. To manage the uncertainties of wind and photovoltaic power generation, robust optimization theory is employed to construct models for both the short-term and long-term output errors of wind and photovoltaic power generation. This approach allows for a more detailed analysis of the uncertainty associated with wind and photovoltaic power generation. Subsequently, the uniqueness of the equilibrium in the established Stackelberg game model is proven. Utilizing an improved adaptive differential evolutionary algorithm in conjunction with the CPLEX solver, not only is the optimal solution solved for, but also the efficiency of the solution scheme is significantly enhanced. The simulation results demonstrate that the strategy not only boosts the reliability of the integrated energy system but also achieves a cost saving of 1.11%, an increase in energy supplier profit of 5.16%, and a load aggregator consumer surplus of 19.68%. In scenarios considering errors in wind and photovoltaic predictions, the cost savings reach 16.95%, with energy seller and supplier profits improving by 9.34% and 32.47% respectively, and consumer surplus increasing by 18.81%.

AB Currently, high levels of output stochasticity in renewable energy and inefficient electrolyzer operation plague IESs when combined with hydrogen energy. To address the aforementioned issues, an IGDT-based economic scheduling strategy for integrated energy systems is put forth. Firstly, this strategy establishes an IES consisting of coupled electricity, heat, hydrogen, and gas taking the hydrogen production electrolyzer's thermal energy utilization into account. Second, to minimize the system's overall operating costs, a deterministic scheduling model of the IES is built by taking into account the stepped carbon trading mechanism and the integrated demand response. Lastly, an optimal dispatch model is built using the information gap decision theory under the two strategies of risk aversion and risk seeking, taking into account the uncertainty of renewable energy generation. CPLEX is the solver used to solve the proposed model. After taking into account the effective use of thermal energy from the electrolyzer and loads demand response, the results show that the system carbon emission is reduced by 2597.68 kg and the operating cost is lowered by 44.65%. The IES scheduling model based on IGDT can effectively manage costs while maintaining system risk control, all while accommodating decision-makers' varying risk preferences. This study can provide a useful reference for the research related to the scheduling of the IES low-carbon economy.

AB The energy flow optimization is important to the operation, planning and trading of integrated energy systems. Based on the energy hub (EH) model, this paper establishes a multi-objective hybrid optimal energy flow model for integrated energy systems that consider operation economy and pollution gas emissions. Power grid constraints, gas grid constraints and EH constraints are involved in the proposed model. The non-dominated improved genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and particle swarm optimization algorithm combined solution method is used to solve the proposed multi-objective hybrid optimal energy flow model. The results show that the proposed model can balance the operation economy and pollution gas emission according to the difference of energy price and load demand. It can flexibly change the transformation and utilization mode of natural gas to provide more operation solutions for operators and realize more rational utilization of energy.

AB optimisation of system reserves and utilisation of renewable energy is an efficient approach to achieving robust optimal dispatch of integrated energy systems (IES). However, conventional robust dispatch methods are often too conservative and lack the ability to consider uncertainties such as renewable energy and contingency probabilities. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a distributionally robust dispatch model that co-optimises reserves and do-not-exceed (DNE) limits while considering these uncertainties. First, a deterministic optimisation model of IES is established with a minimum operational cost objective and security constraints. Next, a two-stage robust collaborative optimisation framework of IES is built, based on the Wasserstein measure, with random equipment faults represented by an adjustable ambiguity set. Finally, to overcome the computational challenges associated with robust approaches, duality theory and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are used to convert the formulation into a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. The Simulation results on the modified IEEE 33-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution methodology.

AB Regional integrated energy systems (RIES) can economically and efficiently use regional renewable energy resources, of which energy storage is an important means to solve the uncertainty of renewable energy output, but traditional electrochemical energy storage is only single electrical energy storage, and the energy efficiency level is low. Hydrogen en-ergy storage has the advantages of large energy storage capacity, long storage time, clean and pollution-free, and can realize the synergistic and efficient utilization of electricity and thermal power. Based on this, this paper proposes a synergistic planning method for an integrated energy system with hydrogen storage taking into account the coupled use of electric-thermal energy, which effectively reduces the system carbon emission and im-proves the comprehensive energy efficiency level. Firstly, this paper constructs an electric -thermal coupling model of the hydrogen energy storage unit and proposes an optimization strategy for the integrated energy system containing hydrogen storage taking into account the utilization of electricity and thermal power. Secondly, a planning optimization model with the lowest economy and carbon emission and the highest comprehensive energy efficiency was constructed. Third, the CSPO-GE optimization algorithm is proposed for solving the problem, which significantly improves the solution efficiency. Finally, a plan-ning optimization simulation of RIES for a residential community W in northern China verifies the effectiveness of the model and method proposed in this paper. The compara-tive analysis of the three schemes shows that compared with the integrated energy system with conventional electrochemical energy storage and heat storage tank as the main form of energy storage and the integrated energy system with only hydrogen storage, the in-tegrated energy system with hydrogen storage and heat storage tank can reduce carbon emissions by 43.8% and 7.61%, respectively, and improve the integrated energy efficiency level by 337.14% and 14.44%.(c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The system includes a combination of renewable energy systems such as wind, solar, hydropower and hydrogen production, storage facilities and conventional fossil-fuel generators. The developed tool consists of various modules where water heating assumes the utilization of waste energy as an option. Furthermore, the application, which is demonstrated for a case study in Tehran, has been considered. The power exchange with the distribution network and injection of hydrogen produced from excess renewable sources into gas network are included in the model. The renewable energy use fractions for stand-alone and on-grid systems are 96.7% and 98.1%, respectively. Also, over a 20-year span and considering a 5% discount rate, the optimum energy cost for the stand-alone system and net present value for the on-grid system rate are 0.28 dollars/kW h and 3944 dollars, respectively.

AB Alternative fuels are expected to play an increasingly crucial role in the decarbonization of the shipping industry. Previous studies have explored the possibility of ship integrated energy systems that use alternative fuels for emission reduction in a cost-efficient manner. However, the various navigation loads and strict space limitations of ships are usually overlooked when designing the ships' energy systems. To fill this gap, a two-stage optimization model is proposed for designing ship integrated energy systems that incorporate alternative fuels, which incorporates internal combustion engines, fuel cells, energy storage technologies, and other relevant equipment. The model captures the ship's volume and weight limitations for alternative fuel applications, and a large cruise ship sailing in Oceania and the Caribbean is selected as a case study. The application feasibilities of four mainstream alternative fuels, i.e., hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and natural gas, have been compared with the conventional diesel power system considering the impact of future trends of fuel cost and emission-related policies. The results indicate that more than 60% of greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced by replacing conventional fossil fuels with alternative fuels. Meanwhile, alternative fuel applications are economically competitive when compared to conventional diesel power systems, considering the growing technology readiness level of fuel production and fuel cells. Overall, this study is expected to provide guidance for the utilization of alternative fuels for ships and to identify the optimal ship integrated energy systems solutions.

TI TWO-STAGE TRADING MECHANISM IN ENABLING THE DESIGN AND OPTIMIZATION OF

AB Currently, renewable energy sources (RES) have been widely deployed in the smart grid, especially in the active distribution network (ADN). However, the inherent uncertainty of the renewable energy output significantly impacts the economy of the ADN operation. It is suggested that the utilization of flexible resources (FR) can effectively even out the uncertainty of RES. Nevertheless, the non-marketization of FR may prevent the emerging park-level integrated energy systems (PIES), important entities in ADN, from sufficiently offering their potential flexibilities. Therefore, this paper presents a two-stage local flexibility trading mechanism for motivating multi-PIESs to provide their flexible resources (PFR) to improve the operational flexibility of ADN. The first stage determines the dispatching plan of ADN according to the day-ahead forecasted values of RES. The second stage enables the multi-PIESs to trade their PFR with ADN to adjust the day-ahead dispatching plan in real-time to correct the forecasted errors of RES. In terms of implementing the two stages, firstly, the capacity of PFR with involving the adjustable tie line power of PIES is quantified using an optimization-based as sessment model. Secondly, based on the change of the operation cost before and after the sale of PFR, a pricing model of PFR is established. And then, to determine the trading amount of PFR, a real-time ADN economic dispatching model with the network constraints is further constructed, which aims at minimizing the comprehensive operation cost. Afterwards, a marginal-based method is employed to obtain the clearing price of PFR. Finally, to ensure the feasibility of the trading results and to provide the accurate dispatching strategies for the PFR trading in next time interval, a rolling dispatch for the multi-PIESs is carried out. Case studies demonstrate that the presented flexibility trading mechanism significantly reduces the power curtailment of ADN, the operation costs of ADN and the multi-PIESs.

AB More flexibility measures are required due to the increasing capacities of variable renewable energies (VRE). In buildings, the integration of energy supplies forms integrated energy systems (IES). IESs can provide flexibility and increase the VRE penetration level. To upgrade a current building energy system into an IES, several energy conversion and storage components are needed. How to decide the component capacities and operate the IES were investigated separately in studies on system planning and system operation. However, a research gap exists that the system configuration from system planning is not validated by actual operation conditions in system operation. Meanwhile, studies on system operation assume that IES configurations are predetermined. This work combines system planning and system operation. The IES configuration is determined by mixed integer linear programming in system planning. Actual operation conditions and forecast errors are considered in system operation. The actual operation profiles are obtained through year-round simulations of different energy management systems. The results indicate that the system configuration from system planning can meet energy demands in system operation. Among different energy management systems, the combination of robust optimization and receding horizon optimization achieves the lowest yearly operation cost. Meanwhile, two scenarios that represent high and low forecast accuracies are studied. Under the high and low forecast accuracy scenarios, the yearly operation costs are about 4% and 6% higher than that obtained from system planning.

AB Energy transformation and consumption improvements have enhanced the planning and utilization of various energy sources. With the rapid expansion of integrated energy systems (IES), integrated demand response (IDR) can contribute to the response by suppressing demand and facilitating the conversion and storage of multiple energy sources, thereby enabling users to participate more freely in network regulation. The article introduces novel concept of IDR, hierarchical interaction structure, and adaptable response resources. It categorizes IDR into four response modes based on load reduction and transfer, load substitution and conversion, contractual agreements, and market interaction control, considering the level of response mode and the initiative/passivity of users. Additionally, it details the modeling process for these four types of IDR. Finally, the paper explores significant technological constraints and future development opportunities for IDR, focusing on intelligent deployment, accurate modeling, market management, intelligent information technology, flexible demand resources, and summarized the risks and challenges in the implementation of IDR. The development of IDR contributes to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

AB This paper proposes a hybrid multi-objective optimization and game-theoretic approach (HMOGTA) to achieve the optimal operation of integrated energy systems (IESs) consisting of electricity and natural gas (E&G) utility networks, multiple distributed energy stations (DESs), and multiple energy users (EUs). The HMOGTA aims to solve the coordinated operation strategy of the electricity and natural gas networks considering the demand characteristics of DESs and EUs. In the HMOGTA, a hierarchical Stackelberg game model is developed for generating equilibrium strategies of DESs and EUs in each district energy network (DEN). Based on the game results, we obtain the coupling demand constraints of electricity and natural gas (CD-CENs) which reflect the relationship between the amounts and prices of electricity and cooling (E&C) that DESs purchase from utility networks. Furthermore, the minimization of conflicting costs of E&G networks considering the CDCENs are solved by a multi-objective optimization method. A case study is conducted on a test IES composed of a 20-node natural gas network, a modified IEEE 30-bus system, and 3 DENs, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed HMOGTA to realize fair treatment for all participants in the IES.

AB The extensive exploitation of traditional energy sources has significantly intensified pressure on environmental protection, making carbon emission reduction a critical strategy to mitigate global warming. Integrated energy systems (IES), based on multi-energy coupling and complementarity, offer a promising approach to enhance renewable energy consumption, improve energy efficiency, and enable low-carbon operation. However, uncertainties in renewable energy generation and user demand present challenges for optimizing IES operation and scheduling. To address these, power-to-gas (P2G) technology, acting as both a renewable energy consumption and CO2 absorption facility, is incorporated into the IES to facilitate electricity-heat-gas cogeneration. Additionally, a carbon emission factor is integrated into the optimization objective, providing a comprehensive assessment of the system's economic and environmental benefits. A multi-objective optimization model is developed, with constraints on energy balance, equipment capacity, and energy storage or release. Dynamic programming (DP) is applied to solve the model and obtain real-time system outputs for the next 24 h, balancing economic and environmental goals. Sensitivity analyses of energy storage capacity and carbon tax price are performed to explore their impacts on system scheduling optimization.

AB Decarbonising the residential heating sector through electrification can add to the existing flexibility demands in the electricity sector arising from spatio-temporal mismatches in supply in demand. Heat demand peaks during winter require seasonal flexibility, since solar availability is at its minimum, while uncontrolled scheduling of heating appliances requires short term flexibility. However, scheduling appliances optimally and seasonal energy storages can deliver short and long term flexibility by tempo-rarily increasing indoor room temperatures in the short term, and hydrogen generation through electrolysis in the long term. Furthermore, waste heat of fuel cells for power supply coincides with heat demand during winter. Therefore, a techno-economic assessment of different heat provision technologies and refurbishments is performed with a building model implementing flexible heat demand. The model can invest in and schedule different appliances and thereby control the indoor temperature within given boundaries. Emission reductions are then applied and sensitivity analyses for indoor temperatures and H-2 prices are performed. The results show that using a combination of solar PV, heat pumps, electrolysers and fuel cells is more cost-efficient than refurbishments. Hydrogen combustion is only used when hydrogen prices fall below gas prices, or when the lower indoor boundary temperature is above 23 degrees C. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the realm of integrated energy systems, the allocation of energy storage capacity stands as a critical challenge. Renewable energy resources (RERs), with their inherent variability and intermittency, pose a threat to grid stability and reliability. Effective management of energy storage resources becomes imperative to counteract the impacts of this volatility, a task contingent upon various factors including the storage technology's type and function. This paper introduces a novel bi-level methodology aimed at determining the optimal allocation of storage capacity across a hybrid energy network to improve its overall performance. The methodology leverages the CONOPT approach within the GAMS platform, which integrates sequential linear and quadratic programming algorithms with reduced gradients to address complex nonlinear optimization issues characterized by sparse and nonlinear constraints. The proposed approach takes into consideration uncertainties associated with RER generation, electrical load, and market prices. Fuzzy C-means clustering is used to generate uncertain scenarios for the output-generated power of the uncertain parameters and then employed to cluster their normally distributed scenarios into fewer representative scenarios. By incorporating these stochastic factors, the methodology aims to identify the most effective way to distribute storage resources to smooth out the variability of renewables-based power. As power systems increasingly rely on variable RERs, the integration of energy storage emerges as crucial for enhancing system stability, resilience, and reliability. This study provides a robust framework to assist in decision-making concerning storage investments and deployment strategies. Through a comparative analysis of three prominent energy storage systems-specifically pumped hydro storage (PHS), sodium-sulfur (NaS), and sodium-nickel chloride (Na-NiCl2)-using comprehensive data, distinct characteristics and trade-offs among these technologies are revealed, offering valuable insights for stakeholders. The results indicate that PHS achieves moderate savings, ranging from 2.12% to 4.68%. In comparison, NaS systems exhibit savings percentages between 3.93% and 4.39%. In contrast, Na-NiCl2 demonstrates notably higher savings percentages, from 5.64% to 5.82%. These findings suggest that Na-NiCl2 stands out as a more economically efficient option, offering enhanced savings potential. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, this paper employs the GAMS platform and juxtaposes its outcomes with those attained through alternative optimization techniques. GAMS showed superior performance compared to other optimization techniques.

AB This article proposes a two-level distributed energy scheduling framework for the coordinated operation of regional integrated energy systems (RIESs), and investigates its effects on the optimal operation of multiarea energy systems (MAESs). The MAES includes an integrated energy distribution system (IEDS) and several networked-RIESs. The IEDS is defined as an integrated system of electrical and natural gas networks. Moreover, the RIES is assumed as a system of multiple local energy carriers such as electricity, heat, and natural gas to provide energy demands. In this research, the IEDS and each RIES are considered as independent systems with individual objectives, so that multiple energy carriers can be directly traded between RIESs. In order to solve the coordinated optimization problems of these interconnected subsystems, the current study implements a distributed optimization framework based on the analytical target cascading structure. In this manner, this study employs an Augmented Lagrangian based penalty function. To solve the local optimization problem of individual energy systems, we utilize the teaching-learning based optimization algorithm. The performance of the proposed method is validated on a test MAES including an IEDS, and three RIESs.

AB This paper develops a novel two-stage coordinated volt-pressure optimization (VPO) for integrated energy systems (IES) networked with energy hubs considering renewable energy sources. The promising power-to-gas (P2G) facilities are used for improving the interdependency of the IES. The proposed VPO contains the traditional volt-VAR optimization functionality to mitigate the voltage deviation while ensuring a satisfying gas quality due to the hydrogen mixture. In addition to the conventional voltage regulating devices, i.e., on-load tap changers and capacitor banks, P2G converter and gas storage are used to address the voltage fluctuation problem caused by renewable penetration. Moreover, an effective two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) based on Wasserstein metric is utilized to capture the renewable uncertainty with tractable robust counterpart reformulations. The Wasserstein-metric based ambiguity set enables to provide additional flexibility hedging against renewable uncertainty. Extensive case studies are conducted in a modified IEEE 33-bus system connected with a 20-node gas system. The proposed VPO provides a voltage-regulated economic operation scheme with gas quality ensured that contributes to high-quality but low-cost multi-energy supply to customers.

AB The optimal capacity of energy storage facilities is a cornerstone for the investment and low-carbon operation of integrated energy systems (IESs). However, the intermittence of renewable energy and the different operating characteristics of facilities present challenges to IES configuration. Therefore, a two-stage decision-making framework is developed to optimize the capacity of facilities for six schemes comprised of battery energy storage systems and hydrogen energy storage systems. The objectives considered are to minimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), power abandonment rate (PAR) and maximize self-sufficiency rate (SSR) simultaneously. In the first stage, each scheme is solved using NSGA-II. In the second stage, the weights of objective function are determined by entropy weight method, while the optimal individual is selected from the Pareto solutions by the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution approach. Life models of battery, fuel cell, and electrolyzer are introduced to quantify device replacement costs. Meanwhile, carbon trading mechanisms and time-of-use tariffs are considered to assess environmental and economic benefits. The results show that the hydrogen-electric coupling scheme demonstrated superior performance, with LCOE, SSR, and PAR of 0.6416 & YEN;/kWh, 48.9 %, and 1.96 %, respectively, and the hydrogen storage tank is closely related to LCOE and PAR.

AB Centralized integrated energy station, which combines electrical power, gas, and heat supplying source together, is emerging with the development of an integrated energy system. In the previous works, the site optimization approaches of energy stations were developed for electrical power and gas sources. In these approaches, the candidate sites only include user nodes. However, with the development of the integrated energy system, the previous approach cannot be applied effectively for the system containing heating networks with high energy transmission loss. The energy transmission loss must be calculated accurately in the optimization approach rather than valued by the simple linear model. This paper aims to propose an optimal site approach of a centralized integrated energy station, in which all possible candidates of energy station sites are considered. The candidates can be any point in the whole energy supplying area. The analysis of energy transmission losses, based on nodal energy flow models, in pipelines and feeders, are incorporated. The simultaneous optimization of the station site and energy distribution networks is conducted. It is found that the energy transmission loss is significant in heating networks; therefore, network optimization should be carried out considering exact energy transmission loss. The optimal station site obtained in the present work has reduced 2.3% of the life cycle cost much more than that obtained from the previous method selecting a site from the user node. A noticeable reduction in life cycle cost, 2.6%, can also be achieved when using the proposed approach for a single energy source station. Moreover, for integrated energy systems, it is found that the adoption of the centralized integrated energy stations is more competitive comparing with the adoption of the single energy source station.

AB In an integrated energy system, the growing number of distributed heat and electric power generation units will bring new technical challenges to the existing centralized economic dispatch strategies. This paper proposes a distributed optimization approach for the economic system operation in a multienergy system by considering various equality and inequality constraints to accommodate the integration of intermittent renewable generations. The proposed distributed neurodynamic-based approach only requires the information exchange among neighboring units and offers flexibility, adaptivity, scalability, faster convergence, and lower communication burden compared with some traditional centralized methods. The simulation results of two integrated energy systems validate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed approach. Comparisons with other centralized and distributed optimization methods quantify the advantages of the proposed distributed approach in terms of convergence speed and computation complexity.

AB This article addresses the challenges of load curve variability in integrated energy systems (IES) and emphasizes carbon neutralization in response to global environmental concerns. It introduces a game-theoretic approach to understand the collaborative dynamics within an integrated energy-hydrogen system (HGESS). The study develops a collaborative game model for the IES-HGESS partnership, focusing on carbon neutralization considerations. Using game theory, it investigates the determinants shaping this partnership and extends to create a hybrid model for day-ahead and real-time markets. To foster enduring cooperation, the study introduces a cooperation profit coefficient and devises an income distribution strategy for HGESS-IES interactions. A load management program is incorporated to reduce costs and enhance profitability. Addressing complexity and constraints, the article introduces an advanced multi-objective particle swarm optimization method. Tested on a sample system under various conditions, the results demonstrate that the alliance between IES and HGESS can significantly enhance net profits, achieving mutual benefit and a win-win outcome while advancing sustainability in energy management.

AB Commercial buildings are large energy consumers and opportunities exist to improve the way they produce and consume electricity, heating and cooling. If energy system integration is feasible, this can lead to significant reductions in energy consumption and emissions. In this context, this work expands on an existing integrated Technology Selection and Operation (TSO) optimisation model for distributed energy systems (DES). The model considers combined heat and power (CHP) and organic Rankine cycle (ORC) engines, absorption chillers, photovoltaic panels and batteries with the aim of guiding decision makers in making attractive investments that are technically feasible and environmentally sound. A retrofit case study of a UK food distribution centre is presented to showcase the benefits and trade-offs that integrated energy systems present by contrasting outcomes when different technologies are considered. Results show that the preferred investment options select a CHP coupled either to an ORC unit or to an absorption chiller. These solutions provide appealing internal rates of return of 28-30% with paybacks within 3.5-3.7 years, while also decarbonising the building by 95-96% (if green gas is used to power the site). Overall, the TSO model provides valuable insights allowing stakeholders to make well-informed decisions when evaluating complex integrated energy systems. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB In this paper, categorized demand response (DR) programs are proposed to address the coordinated planning problem in multi-region integrated energy systems (MRIESs). The categorized DR programs comprise a discrete manufacturing production model for industrial areas, a real-time pricing-based DR program for commercial areas, and diverse operational tasks for various electrical appliances in residential areas. Subsequently, the detailed DR model is leveraged to minimize the operation cost and gas emissions in a renewable-integrated MRIES considering the uncertainties from wind and solar power. Then, a flexible adjustable robust optimization (FARO) approach is presented to deal with all uncertainty sources. The FARO approach aims to ensure the safe operation of the MRIES against any uncertainty while meeting predefined performance objectives. Furthermore, a bi-level solution algorithm is designed by combining the stochastic dichotomy method and the column-and-constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm to solve our coordinated planning model. Finally, case studies are conducted on a practical MRIES in Changsha, China. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the categorized DR programs in adjusting allocable resources to maximize holistic system profits. Besides, compared to the commonly used information-gap decision theory (IGDT) method, our FARO approach can maintain the optimality of the solution while reducing conservatism.

AB With the increasingly prominent environmental problems in the world today, the development of an integrated energy system and the introduction of a carbon-trading mechanism have become important means to realize the low carbonization of the energy industry. Based on this, this paper introduces the carbon-trading mechanism into the research on the optimal dispatch of an integrated energy system. The mechanism of integrated energy demand response participating in low-carbon economic dispatch is analyzed. The relationship between carbon emissions and carbon-trading price in carbon-trading mechanism is described. On the basis of considering the commodity attributes of the electricity and gas load and the flexible supply characteristics of the thermal load, an incentive-type comprehensive energy demand response model is established. Finally, aiming at the lowest comprehensive operating cost, a comprehensive energy system model considering the power balance and equipment constraints of the electric-gas-heat system is established, using an improved particle swarm algorithm to solve it. Simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing the carbon emissions and operating costs of integrated energy systems.

AB The increasing demand for sustainable energy solutions is driving the integration of various renewable energy technologies. Integrating electric vehicle batteries, photovoltaics, heat pumps, and thermal tanks into building energy systems offers a promising approach to enhancing energy flexibility and efficiency. However, research on such integrated energy systems is still in its infancy. Optimizing the configuration and operation of the system may lead to significant cost savings and improved energy management. A coupled model and simulation-based optimization approach are used to optimize the thermal tank capacity and key operational parameters to minimize the annual total cost. The results show that the integrated energy system reduces the annual total cost by 36.35% and monthly electricity bills by up to 69.26% compared to the base system. As for energy flexibility, only 13.91% of electricity demand is supplied by the grid during peak periods, and the monthly load coefficient, load cover ratio, and photovoltaic self-consumption ratio of the integrated energy system are significantly improved. This study demonstrates the economic and operational benefits of integrating various renewable energy technologies into building energy systems and provides new insights into their design and optimization.

AB In this paper, a blockchain-enabled distributed market framework is proposed for the bi-level carbon and energy trading between coal mine integrated energy systems (CMIESs) and a virtual power plant (VPP) with network constraints. To maximize the profits of these two entities and describe their complicated interactions in the market, the bi-level trading problem is formulated as a Stackelberg game considering integrating the energy market and the "cap-and-trade" carbon market mechanism. Meanwhile, in the CMIES, energy recovery units and belt conveyors can be flexibly scheduled and the pumped hydroelectric storage in the VPP is scheduled for energy management. To tackle uncertainties from PV outputs, the joint trading, and the energy management is solved by the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) method. In addition, for participants' privacy, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) - based DRO algorithm is applied to solve the trading problem in a distributed framework. Further, the Proof-of-Authority (PoA) blockchain is deployed to develop a safe and anonymous market platform. Finally, case studies along with numerous comparison cases are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method can effectively reduce the system operation cost and regional carbon emission, reduce the conservativeness and protect the privacy of each participant.

AB Electrolysis hydrogen generation technology is one of the feasible ways to alleviate the problem of wind electricity curtailment. One promising hydrogen value-added application is to blend hydrogen into the natural gas grid and sell it as the heat energy carrier. This paper aims to discuss the feasibility of a roadmap to urban energy internet with wind electricity-natural gas nexus. Firstly, a framework is raised to integrate wind electricity generation, electrolysis hydrogen generation, and hydrogen-natural gas blending systems. Secondly, a series of reasonable hydrogen supply profiles are provided based on annual electricity curtailment and realistic natural gas scheduling. Then, an energy optimisation model and a techno-economic model are applied to simulate the generation of electricity and hydrogen, as well as determine the most economical hydrogen supply scheme. Finally, a case study in the Beijing-Tianjin Hebei region of China is taken to validate the benefits of the proposed roadmap. The preferred scheme is worked out with the net present value of 88.8 M$, including the economy configurations of the electricity-hydrogen hybrid generation system, as well as the hydrogen-natural gas blending plan. The results also indicate that annual electricity curtailment and annual carbon emission are decreased by 204 GWh (48.8%) and 40.2 kt (49.9%).(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The multi-agent characteristics of integrated energy systems are becoming increasingly prominent, rendering the energy management problems more intricate. Additionally, the distributed agents are faced with challenges from the communication layer, such as packet losses and privacy disclosure issues. Therefore, a privacy-preserving neurodynamic-based optimization strategy considering packet losses is proposed in this article. A privacy-preserving communication model is constructed based on differential privacy (DP). Unlike traditional DP methods, the privacy preservation mechanism employed in this article can achieve a quantified high level of privacy while ensuring the solution accuracy of the optimization algorithm. Moreover, communication packet loss models based on both the two-state Markov process and the Bernoulli process are established. The proposed fully distributed scheme only requires communication between adjacent agents. The efficiency of the neurodynamic-based approach, the high-level privacy preservation, and the robustness against communication packet loss are demonstrated through several case studies.

AB Coupling the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) with integrated energy systems (IES) offers an emerging solution for decarbonisation of both energy and transport sectors. To evaluate the feasibility of coupling V2G with IES as a flexible storage, we propose an optimisation-based system planning framework embedding V2G into IES. Within this framework, stochastic features of electric vehicles (EV) fleets are simulated. The impacts of V2G on IES design are captured by assessing both economic and environmental benefits via multi-objective optimisations utilising an improved NSGA-II algorithm. Six case studies considering three cities with different climate conditions and two functional areas of residential and commercial are performed. The results manifest that Beijing-commercial case could achieve the largest mutual benefits. The EV fleets' charging behaviour follows the time-of-use energy tariff in transition seasons while not during winter. Sensitivity analysis indicates the electricity and gas prices have significant impact on the system design. The benefits induced by growing EV penetration would gradually decrease and stabilise when the EV number reach 300, the growth of economic and environmental benefits stabilized at 1.3% and 1.8%, respectively. Overall, this study quantifies the benefits of enabling V2G in IES, and generates valuable insights for IES planners, V2G service providers, and relevant policymakers. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB To improve the effective planning of electricity-gas integrated energy systems (EGIES) among various stakeholders with distinct interests, a multi-agent game based joint long-term planning approach considering wind power uncertainty is proposed in this paper. First, the planning profit models of individual stakeholders are constructed. Then, the robust optimization approach is employed to deal with uncertainties of wind power outputs, and a virtual player "nature" is introduced to represent uncertainties in the game process. Moreover, based on the analysis of the game mechanism among various stakeholders, a bi-level dynamic game based planning model for EGIES is proposed, conducting security checks through an integrated electricity-gas energy flow model. Finally, the proposed planning model is solved by an iterative search algorithm. Simulation results illustrate superiority of the proposed approach via two aspects: first, it guarantees the equity and provide fair profit allocation of all players in the game; second, it ensures security of the integrated energy system by effectively mitigating violations on voltage and nodal gas pressure limits.

AB Under the dual-carbon policy, the optimization of coal mine integrated energy systems (CMIESs) has garnered increasing attention from researchers. However, the characteristics of multiple optimization objectives, strong coupling constraints, and high-dimensional decision variables pose significant challenges for optimization methods. Existing constrained multi-objective optimization algorithms struggle to effectively solve such problems with multiple complex characteristics, and they are prone to getting stuck in local optima. To address this issue, this paper proposes a temporal-segmentation-and-fusion-based large-scale constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, which divides the evolutionary process into two stages. In the subspace optimization stage, the large-scale space is divided into multiple smaller subspaces according to the problem's temporal divisibility characteristics, then these subspaces are progressively integrated and optimized by using a portion of the computational resources. Once all subspaces are integrated, the original space optimization stage is activated, then the remaining computational resources are employed to search the original large-scale space. In addition, a differential evolution mutation strategy based on dynamic neighborhoods is studied, which effectively balances global exploration and local exploitation, guiding the population toward promising regions in the search space. Finally, the experimental results with several advanced evolutionary algorithms on an actual CMIES dispatch case demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

AB In efforts to mitigate global warming, reducing greenhouse gas emissions represented by carbon dioxide, this paper introduces a stepped carbon trading mechanism for local Integrated Energy Systems (IES) that are not yet engaged in carbon trading markets as a tool for carbon emission rights trading. To minimize both overall system costs and carbon trading expenses, we propose a refined Power-to-Gas (P2G) model that includes a waste heat recovery process. In addition, all gas-fired units within the IES are retrofitted to support low-carbon operations, and a coupled operation mode of carbon capture power plants and P2G is introduced. To manage uncertainties in wind and solar power output, Latin hypercube sampling and K-means clustering methods are employed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheduling strategy significantly reduces system operating costs while realizing an similar to 16.2% reduction in carbon emissions.

AB With the progression of hydrogen energy technologies, Regional Integrated Energy Systems (RIES) have become instrumental in fostering energy transitions and enhancements. However, the absence of adequate regulatory frameworks for hydrogen-based RIES, hampers the full exploitation of hydrogen energy's potential. Moreover, RIES systems do not intrinsically possess zero-pollution characteristics. To tackle these issues, this study introduces three major innovations: a bi-level scheduling model incorporating a hydrogen energy co-supply strategy, a dynamic carbon capture approach for RIES, and a multi-objective Kepler optimization algorithm (MOKOA) for solving the model. The MOKOA is tailored to assess the impacts of hydrogen energy and carbon capture on system operations, and the interactions among different energy stakeholders. The findings indicate that with dynamic carbon capture strategies, increasing the hydrogen energy utilization factor from 0.2 to 0.6 results in a 6.73 % and 3.50% increase in returns for energy producers and energy dispatch centers, respectively. Despite a 1.35 % increase in the comprehensive economic cost of IESs, carbon emissions decline by 2.54 %, and total electricity generation from hydrogen fuel cells escalates from 856.83 kWh to 1869.41 kWh. This improvement in hydrogen utilization and concurrent reduction in carbon emissions markedly enhance the economic viability of RIES operations.

AB This study introduces an innovative approach by formulating and evaluating a synergistic biomass-geothermal structure, emphasizing optimized inter-component connections. The research stands out for its thorough analysis of parameter impacts on the system and variables, addressing an unexplored aspect in integrated energy systems. The multi-generation systems are the integration of a combined gasification gas turbine cycle, double flash geothermal cycle, and proton exchange membrane cycle for the generating power and hydrogen. The overall system and its subsystems are studied to explore how the performance of thermodynamics and the total cost rate are influenced by operating parameters. The best operational conditions for both subsystems and the overall system have been determined by analyzing the impact of operating parameters on the thermodynamic behavior and environmental impact through parametric studies. The findings indicate while Sabalan's current efficiency is 16.26 %, the system energy efficiency reached 24.89 % when coupled with other renewable source. To enhance the system's efficiency, a genetics algorithm was utilized to simultaneously optimize the total cost of exergy destruction and investment cost. The outcome of the multi-objective optimization revealed that the exergy efficiency of optimal point for the system is 29.8 % and a total investment cost is 6 (M$/year).

AB Retrofitting coal-fired units with carbon capture plants is an important means to achieve low-carbon improvements in integrated energy systems (IES). However, the lack of flexible resources restricts the development of carbon capture power plants, and the uncertainty of IES affects the reliability of system. With this background, this study proposes a low-carbon economic dispatch strategy considering extended electric heating demand response. Firstly, the organic Rankine cycle waste heat power generation is introduced to decouple the "power determined by heat" mode of combined heat and power. Secondly, incentive-based electric load demand response, as well as comfort fuzziness-based heat load demand response are considered. Subsequently, a datadriven distributionally robust optimization model is developed to solve the source-load uncertainty problem, where the confidence set of the uncertainty probability distribution is constrained by both 1-norm and infinity-norm constraints. The column and constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm is used to solve the model and obtain the operating output configuration. Finally, the test system verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Natural gas is the main energy source and carbon emission source of integrated energy systems (IES). In existing studies, the price of natural gas is generally fixed, and the impact of price fluctuation which may be brought by future liberalization of the terminal side of the natural gas market on the IES is rarely considered. This paper constructs a natural gas price fluctuation model based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) algorithms. It uses the improved epsilon constraint method and fuzzy multi-weight technology to solve the Pareto frontier set considering the system operation cost and carbon emission. The system operation cost is described using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) to predict the stochastic output of the renewable energy source, and a penalty function based on the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) model to describe the thermal comfort of the user. This is analyzed using the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm. Carbon emissions are calculated using the carbon accounting method, and a ladder penalty mechanism is introduced to define the carbon trading price. Results of the comparison illustrate that the Pareto optimal solution tends to choose less carbon emission, electricity is more economical, and gas is less carbon-intensive in a small IES for end-users when the price of natural gas fluctuates. The impacts of various extents of natural gas price fluctuation for the same load are also discussed.

AB Some regional integrated energy systems (RIES) have installed equipments such as wind turbine and photovoltaic, but the fluctuation of these intermittent power supply is large, resulting in a certain amount of energy waste. Because energy storage can improve the utilization rate of renewable energy, this paper establishes a storage capacity expansion planning model considering multiple functions of hybrid energy storage in the RIES. In this model, the wavelet packet decomposition method is used to reasonably decompose the high-frequency fluctuation and low-frequency fluctuation of renewable energy to achieve the function of stabilizing fluctuation. Meanwhile, an operation strategy for hybrid energy storage to participate in demand response is proposed. Rain flow counting method is used to research the life of hybrid energy storage system, which improves the accuracy of energy storage annual cost calculation. In the Simulation and Analysis section, the genetic quantum algorithm is used for simulation and analysis of the role and benefits of hybrid energy storage. The simulation results show that the benefit of hybrid energy storage in capacity expansion construction is increased by 10.4%, and when the electricity and gas prices fluctuate by +/- 20%, the hybrid energy storage configuration proposed in this paper has a stable advantage in more than 95%.

AB Integrated energy systems (IESs) considering power-to-gas (PtG) technology are an encouraging approach to improve the efficiency, reliability, and elasticity of the system. As the evolution towards decarbonization is increasing, the unified coordination between IESs and PtG technology is also increasing. PtG technology is an option for long-term energy storage in the form of gas, but, compared to other technologies, it is economically expensive at the present time to optimize the technology. This article presents a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research and of the developments regarding integrated energy systems considering PtG technology. This presented review emphasizes planning and economic analysis, including system integration enhancements focusing on optimization, conversion technologies, and energy storage to improve the operation and stability and to enhance the facilities for consumers. The role of a PtG system in generation, transmission, distribution, and consumption is discussed. By emphasizing planning, integration, and the role, this paper aims to guide researchers, scientists, engineers, and policy makers towards effective research and broad strategies that sustain an IES-PtG.

AB With advanced information technologies applied in integrated energy systems (IESs), controlling the energy conversion has become an effective method for improving grid flexibility and reducing the operating cost of IESs. This study proposes a dynamic energy conversion strategy for the energy management of an IES with renewable energy, which considers the system operator's (SO) operating cost. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is used to illustrate the hierarchical decision-making process, in which the dynamic energy conversion problem is formulated as a discrete finite Markov decision process, and proximal policy optimization (PPO) is adopted to solve the decision-making problem. Using DRL, the SO can adaptively decide the wind power conversion ratio during the online learning process, where the uncertainties of customers' load demand profiles, flexibility of spot electricity prices, and wind power generation are addressed. Simulations show that the proposed PPO-based renewable energy conversion algorithm can effectively reduce the SO's operating cost.

DE Integrated energy system; Natural disasters; Prevention-resistance;
   Resilience improvement; Robust optimization
AB The construction of integrated energy systems can help improve energy efficiency and promote global energy transition. However, in recent years, the occurrence of extreme natural disasters has brought certain threats to the safe and stable operation of the integrated energy system. Thus, it is necessary to improve the ability of the integrated energy system to resist disasters, reduce disaster losses, and restore energy supply as soon as possible, i.e., improve its resilience. Considering the influence of pre-disaster prevention measures and disaster-time operational measures on system disaster resilience and the correlation between the two, this paper proposes a system hardening strategy based on three-layer robust optimization. The upper layer formulates the optimal hardening strategy of the system before the disaster event occurs, the middle layer identifies the failed elements in the worst disaster situation, while the lower layer realizes the system operational optimization by coordinating the energy storage charging and discharging plan of each subsystem. The strategy can reduce the total supply shortage of the integrated energy system and improve the flexibility of the system in the pre-disaster prevention and disaster resistance integration stages.

AB In response to escalating environmental concerns and the shortage of traditional energy resources, it is essential to enhance energy management within multienergy markets to facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources with end-users. To this end, our research focuses on the optimization of community-level integrated energy systems (CIESs) equipped with combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP), utilizing a multiagent system (MAS) and a hierarchical Stackelberg game approach. The research begins with the development of an MAS-based optimization framework for game participants, followed by the establishment of a Stackelberg game model where the multienergy seller acts as the leader and the consumer as the follower. The model is thoroughly validated through the formulation and solution of a mixed-integer linear program (MILP)-based multiobjective optimization, which not only demonstrates effective strategies for optimizing power dispatch but also enhances economic returns and ensures fast game convergence. The results significantly validate the approach of maximizing the utilization of clean energy in energy transactions, clarifying the dynamic relationship between price fluctuations and load in the pricing mechanism. These insights are vital for promoting environmental sustainability and conserving resources, proving essential for future energy management practices.

AB Coal Power Plants (CPPs), despite their substantial contribution to global energy needs, pose significant environmental concerns due to Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Thus, the world has started thinking of alternative generation sources to replace CPPs. To replace CPPs, some energy generation resources must come into the scenario that can outshine the advantages of CPPs, such as easy availability of fuel, operational safety, and cost effectiveness. Concerning this matter, nuclear-renewable integrated systems can play a vital role as a potential replacement for CPPs. In this study, we systematically explore the transitional approach from CPPs to advanced energy systems and conduct an exhaustive comparative analysis focusing on three proposed energy system models: Greenfield, Coal-to-Nuclear (C2N), and Coal-to-Integrated Energy Systems (C2IES). Before conducting the comparative analysis, we determine the most feasible coal sites from Alaska, our surrogate location for this study, using a GIS-based nuclear reactor siting tool named "Siting Tool for Advanced Nuclear Development (STAND)." To carry out the comparative analysis among the proposed energy models for the selected coal site, we find out the optimal configuration of each system using a robust and recent nature-based metaheuristic optimization algorithm, Mountain Gazelle Optimization (MGO), complemented by another nature-based meta- heuristic optimization algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), for validation. The key data used in this study include solar irradiance, temperature, wind speed, load profiles, and comprehensive cost data for each system component. Since the proposed energy models are highly complex and consider several assumptions, the key research findings are strengthened by performing a comprehensive sensitivity analysis. The base case results show that C2IES can reduce the Cost of Energy (COE) by roughly 65 % compared to Greenfield and C2N and ensure the utmost reliability of the energy system. Although this cost-saving margin contrasts in the sensitivity analysis across a range of scenarios, C2IES consistently offers the most cost-effective solution, highlighting its potential for sustainable energy transition.

However, existing carbon trading models, constrained by fixed settlement cycles, face difficulties in addressing the scheduling needs of energy systems that operate across multiple time scales. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an optimal scheduling methodology for hydrogen-encompassing integrated energy systems that incorporates a multi-time-scale carbon trading mechanism. The proposed approach dynamically optimizes the scheduling and conversion of hydrogen energy, electricity, thermal energy, and other energy forms by flexibly adjusting the carbon trading cycle. It accounts for fluctuations in energy demand and carbon emissions occurring both before and during the operational day. In the day-ahead scheduling phase, a tiered carbon transaction cost model is employed to optimize the initial scheduling framework. During the day scheduling phase, real-time data are utilized to dynamically adjust carbon quotas and emission ranges, further refining the system's operational strategy. Through the analysis of typical case studies, this method demonstrates significant benefits in reducing carbon emission costs, enhancing energy efficiency, and improving system flexibility.

AB In the future integrated energy market, the traditional centralized planning method cannot solve the planning problem for multi-stakeholder integrated energy systems (MSIESs). To cope with this problem, this paper proposes a synchronously decentralized adaptive robust programming (SDARP) model for MSIESs based on the analytical target cascading (ATC) algorithm. In this model, different stakeholders are planned in parallel under the source-load uncertainties, aiming at minimizing the annual investment and operation costs and fully taking into account the interactive heating/cooling power transmitted by the district heating/cooling network. In each stakeholder, the column-and-constraint generation algorithm is used to address the robustness problems in the three-layer adaptive robust programming model. In addition, a tractable alternating optimization procedure is used to solve the non-convex SDARP model with finite convergence. Case studies verify the superiority and effectiveness of the SDARP method in dealing with the planning problem of MSIESs.

AB The economic model of cloud energy storage (CES) can help solving the problem of high cost of self-built energy storage. As a contribution to the field of integrated energy systems, the application mechanism of CES for both electric and heat energy systems is studied in this paper, where an optimal configuration and service pricing method of electric-heat CES model based on Stackelberg game approach are proposed. Firstly, a Stackelberg game framework is constructed to consider the interests of both CES provider and users. Secondly, five economic components including energy storage service fee are established, where the optimization models of CES provider and users are built with the objectives of maximizing net revenue and minimizing energy cost, respectively. By decoupling the charging demand of users and the charging plan of the CES provider, the proposed model allows the CES provider to have good flexibility in purchasing energy from the grid and heat network for storage, which in turn can reduce costs and increase revenue. After that, the game problem is constructed as a two-layer optimization model and transformed into a single-layer optimization model based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, where the large-M method is used to deal with the nonlinear equation constraints. Finally, experimental case is designed for three types of loads, namely: industrial areas, residential areas and commercial areas, as four comparison scenarios are studied to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods in enhancing the economy and balancing the interests of multiple subjects.

AB Based on the system with combined cooling, heating and power, this paper formulates a multi-objective balance optimization scheduling framework of community integrated energy systems, in which demand response programs are considered. To quantify the customer's dissatisfaction caused by the changes in energy use style and a decline in comfort, the electricity dissatisfaction function and heat/cold dissatisfaction function are constructed based on Kano's model. Then, a comprehensive customer dissatisfaction model is proposed based on a combination of subjective weight and objective weight method. Furthermore, a multi-objective optimization model is constructed to minimize total operating costs, comprehensive customer dissatisfaction and carbon dioxide emissions. The case study is considered in two different customer dissatisfaction functions: the linear customer dissatisfaction function and Kano's model-based customer dissatisfaction function. Finally, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is utilized to simultaneously optimize three goals and get the Pareto fronts. From the obtained Pareto fronts, the best scheme is obtained by using the entropy-weighting Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. The results show that the proposed customer dissatisfaction model can effectively reduce the operating costs, customer dissatisfaction, and carbon emissions, under the premise of balancing the three objective functions, compared with the linear customer dissatisfaction model.

AB To enhance the economic viability of integrated energy systems, it is important to balance risk and reward while ensuring operational flexibility and compliance with regulatory constraints. Developing an integrated risk measurement method for energy trading in energy markets that complies with regulatory constraints adds another layer of complexity, especially when dealing with large-scale heterogeneous energy systems, such as those dominated by green hydrogen. Ensuring adherence to market regulations, grid codes, and flexible requirements requires a thorough understanding of legal frameworks and policy considerations, as well as integrating regulatory constraints into the bidding/offering strategies. To address these challenges and enable the profitable development of integrated electricity-hydrogen energy systems (IEHSs), this paper develops a risk-constrained bidding/offering self-scheduling strategy for IEHSs that allows for simultaneous trading in day-ahead energy and reserve electricity markets. The developed self-scheduling strategy regulates hydrogen and power flow in a centralized manner, taking into account the operational limits of the power sector, hydrogen fueling stations (HFSs), electric vehicle parking lots, fuel cell vehicle parking lots, and renewable energy sources. As a salient feature, the important human-related factors in the mobility sector are included in the proposed strategy to motivate private owners to collaborate with IEHSs and to accommodate the charging demand of vehicles with electricity market signals. To obtain the robust day-ahead schedule, economic risks associated with renewable power generation, calls for reserve deployment, and electricity market prices are taken into consideration. Towards this end, a stochastic adaptive robust optimization approach is proposed to control the risk of profit variability, which is solved by a nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed strategy are verified using the modified IEEE 14-bus test system, as a standard scale of local IEHSs. The numerical results highlight the synergies impact between HFSs and the power sector, resulting in an increase in the profit of the IEHS from $101.654k to $275.078k. Furthermore, the IEHS can improve its profit margin and competitiveness by employing the tri-level stochastic adaptive robust optimization approach. This approach ensures that the IEHS is resistant to sudden changes in real -time interactions, even with an 8.14% increase in the imbalance cost.

AB An optimal energy-reserve scheduling model of wind-photovoltaic-hydrogen integrated energy systems (WPH-IES) with multi-type energy storage devices including electric, thermal and hydrogen is presented in this paper. The chance-constrained programming (CCP) theory is utilized to model the impact of renewable and load uncertainties on reserve constraints. Considering the non-convex of proposed CCP model, an improved discretized step transformation (DST) method is proposed to transform the CCP problem into a solv-able mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. In addition, a critical threshold value selection approach is developed to reduce the number of constraints and improve solution efficiency. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed energy-reserve model can reduce the total operating cost on the premise of ensuring the safety of system operation. The combined improved DST and critical threshold value selection method can reduce computational burden and improve the accuracy of scheduling results.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB The integration of source-grid-load-storage greatly improves the energy managing flexibility of regional integrated energy systems (RIES). Considering the conflicting interests of multi-operator, this paper divides RIES into 1) energy supply center (ESC); 2) load aggregator (LA); 3) energy storage aggregator (ESA), and establishes a multi-operator two-layer optimal scheduling model by combining 1) the Stackelbelberg-Nash asymmetric bargaining game based on the genetic algorithm; and 2) the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm (GA-ADMM). Firstly, considering the absence of historical data, trapezoidal fuzzy parameters are introduced to construct fuzzy chance constraints based on credibility theory to simulate the source-load uncertainties. Secondly, the uncertainty of demand response behavior, real-time carbon credits trading within RIES, and cooperation-competition behavior of followers (LA and ESA) are considered to simulate the asymmetric relationship between followers and leaders (ESC) based on GA. Then, based on the ADMM algorithm, a Nash asymmetric bargaining game considering energy dependency and energy supply-reception status is proposed to realize the revenue allocation between followers. Finally, simulations are implemented to verify the validity and reliability of the proposed model. Results show that: 1) Cooperation improves the energy-managing flexibility of followers, reduces their dependence on ESC, and thus enhances their game ability. 2) The real-time carbon credits trading enables zero-carbon energy interactions and natural gas replenishment within RIES. 3) Increases in the price of various energy and carbon credits can enhance cooperation between followers.

AB The ongoing reforms in electricity markets have pushed energy producers and consumers to confront an increasingly uncertain market environment. The integrated energy systems (IES), designed to integrate a wide range of energy resources and carriers, have the potential to address the uncertainties of market trading. To this end, this paper innovatively introduces the Wasserstein metric-based distributionally robust optimization theory to construct a bidding model for IES participating in the spot power market. Firstly, the bidding mechanisms of the spot market across day-ahead, intraday and real-time market are analyzed, the decision-making keys for IES operators are proposed. Secondly, a data-driven Wasserstein metric ambiguity set is constructed to deal with price uncertainty, taking the minimization of expected cost and conditioned value-at-risk as objective, a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) bidding model is proposed for IES participating in the market. Thirdly, addressing the inherent complexity of the infinite-dimensional worst-case expectation problem, the proposed model is reformulated to a finite-dimensional mixed integer linear programming problem for computationally tractable, with rigorous reformulation process and final model presented in detail. Finally, taking the spot power market in Shandong Province, China, as an example, a case study is carried out to verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed model. Comparison with stochastic programming and robust optimization show that the proposed model has better out-of-sample performance.

AB With the increasing global demand for low-carbon, safe, and efficient energy supply systems, the development of Integrated Energy Systems (IES) has attracted widespread attention in the energy field in recent years. In this context, the theoretical research and methodological exploration of Energy Storage Systems (ESS), as a key component within the IES framework, have become particularly important. This article proposes an innovative method for rational allocation of energy storage capacity and selection of appropriate energy storage types in IES. This method comprehensively considers the power characteristics, energy characteristics, and economic factors of different energy storage media, and constructs an integrated joint optimization model based on Non dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). On this basis, the influence of discharge depth on the capacity degradation of ESS is analyzed, and an energy storage cycle life model is established. This model aims to optimize the entire lifecycle cost and carbon emissions of IES, thereby effectively guiding power allocation. By comparing and analyzing four different energy storage configuration schemes, the research results have verified the effectiveness of this method in achieving economic and environmentally friendly optimization, as well as extending the service life of ESS.

AB Deploying distributed energy resources (DERs) is crucial for decarbonizing the building sector, but challenges arise due to the energy mismatch between on-site generation and consumption. Impacts of large-scale development of distributed energy technology are seldom evaluated from a system-wide perspective. This study primarily utilizes high-resolution meter data to analyze residential energy consumption behaviors and variability of solar photovoltaics (PV), heat pump and fuel cell throughout the year. Then, rolling horizon optimization is applied to harness demand flexibility through scheduling developed integrated energy systems, considering synergies between on-site energy resources and demand side management. The techno-economic performances of the integrated systems are investigated by adopting wholesale spot prices for PV grid feed-in. Results show that flexible schedule of integrated energy systems can deliver multiple benefits, including energy saving, cost reduction and grid-support interaction, improvement in PV self-consumption through flexible coupling can exceed 40 % compared to the measured results. The effectiveness of demand-side solutions strongly depends on the density and variability of household energy consumption, micro cogeneration presents a greater potential of cost-saving and carbon reduction in winter months. Findings emphasize the importance of coordinated demand management strategy in enhancing effectiveness of energy usage and grid-friendly interactions under widespread DERs implementation.

AB Accelerating the deep decarbonization of the world's electric grids requires the coordination of complex energy systems and infrastructures across timescales from seconds to decades. In this paper, we present a new multiscale simulation framework that integrates process-and grid-centric modeling paradigms to better design, operate, and control integrated energy systems (IESs), which combine multiple technologies, in wholesale energy markets. Traditionally, IESs are analyzed with a process-centric paradigm such as levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) or annualized net revenue, ignoring important interactions with electricity markets. This framework explicitly models the complex interactions between an IES's bidding, scheduling, and control decisions and the energy market's clearing and settlement processes, while incorporating operational uncertainties. Through two case studies, we show the importance of understanding and quantifying complex resource-grid interactions. In case study 1, we demonstrate that optimized bidding from one resource shifts the profit distribution for all energy systems in the market. This result suggests new and more flexible IES technologies can disrupt the economics of all market participants, possibly leading to accelerated retirements of less flexible resources. Interestingly, the optimized bidding has little impact on grid-level aggregate statistics, such as total generation costs and renewable penetration rate. While aggregate modeling strategies may remain valid under some IES adoption scenarios for analysis focused on regional outcomes, direct comparisons of IES technologies at specific locations without considering these interactions may lead to misleading or incorrect conclusions. In case study 2, we consider the design and flexible operation of IESs that hybridize conventional generators with energy storage. Through a sensitivity analysis, we find that as the size of the storage system increases, the total number of start-ups for coal-and natural gas-based IESs reduced by 25% and 33.6%, and the total thermal generator ramping (i.e., mileage) reduced by 86.5% and 62.5%, respectively. This shows the primary benefit of storage may not be reduced operational costs (which do not change significantly) but fewer start-ups and less ramping, which may greatly simplify the design, operation, and control of carbon capture systems. The new modeling and optimization capabilities from this work enable the coupling of rigorous, dynamic process models with grid-level production cost models to quantitatively identify the nuanced interdependencies across these vast timescales that must be addressed to realize clean, safe, and secure energy production. Moreover, the proposed general multiscale simulation framework is applicable to all IES technologies and can be easily extended to consider other energy carriers (e.g., hydrogen, ammonia) and energy infrastructures (e.g., natural gas pipelines).

AB The energy-carbon coordination within multi-community integrated energy systems (MCIES) emerges as a promising strategy for enhancing energy efficiency and mitigating carbon emissions. To safeguard the privacy of individual community integrated energy systems, distributed optimization is implemented in MCIES coordination. However, existing studies neglect the influence of imperfect communication conditions on distributed energy-carbon coordination optimization. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a distributed optimization approach for MCIES, incorporating energy sharing and carbon trading, to mitigate the impact of imperfect communication conditions. Firstly, an energy-carbon coordination optimization model for MCIES is formulated, considering the power transformer's loading capacity to prevent congestion. Then, a novel fully distributed optimization method based on the relaxed alternating direction method of multiplier (RADMM) is proposed to solve the scheduling model of MCIES considering various imperfect communication conditions. The proposed RADMM algorithm effectively tackles convex optimization problems with coupling equality constraints over undirected networks, facilitating global optimal solutions through direct communication solely among neighboring community agents without the need for a third party. Furthermore, it enables the distributed coordinated optimization model of MCIES to function reliably even in imperfect communication environments, including lossy, noisy, and quantized communications. Simulation results demonstrate the developed scheduling model's ability to ensure safe, economically beneficial, and environmentally friendly MCIES operation. Additionally, the proposed RADMM approach exhibits superior performance in terms of convergence rate and robustness against packet loss and corruption compared to the classical ADMM method.

AB The rapid evolution of Integrated Energy Systems (IESs) demands robust management of information transmission, which is critical for real-time monitoring, coordination, and operational efficiency. However, the increasing complexity and costs associated with information exchange necessitate effective pricing mechanisms to ensure economic sustainability and optimal resource allocation. This paper presents an evolutionary game-theoretic framework to analyze regulatory strategies governing information transmission within IES. In the context of market dynamics, both market regulators and communication network operators are considered as actors with bounded rationality, emphasizing their strategic interplay within the system. The main contributions include formulating a model that treats communication network operators as independent entities, enhancing the understanding of IES member diversity and interactivity. This study introduces evolutionary game dynamics, providing new insights into optimizing regulatory policies. This paper also innovates by considering asset utilization in defining effective assets, potentially curbing excessive investment by communication network operators and preventing information transmission prices from soaring. A case study is provided to reveal the dynamics and equilibrium states of the regulatory game, offering theoretical support for refining regulatory strategies in IESs.

AB Dispatch strategies on optimum sizing of hybrid renewable energy systems are crucial for attaining a costeffective and reliable power supply. In this paper, the effects of dispatch strategies on optimum sizing of photovoltaic/energy storage/diesel/ reverse osmosis desalination hybrid scheme for supplying the electrical loads and freshwater demand of a remote region are presented. The size of the components of the hybrid scheme are optimized to minimize the total net annual cost and minimizing the system's Levelized cost of energy and to minimize the cost of the desalinated water produced, and the reliability index. For this aim, two optimal dispatch strategies, load following, and cycle charging, are designed for integrated energy systems. So an efficient heuristic algorithm, tabu search, is used for optimum sizing of the hybrid energy scheme. The results are compared with the results obtained by well-known optimization method, harmony search. In each of the strategies, the effects of reliability index and economic factors, including diesel generator initial cost, fuel cost, the O&M cost of diesel generator, initial battery cost, photovoltaic initial cost, and the interest rate, on the optimization of the hybrid energy scheme have been investigated. It showed that the tabu search algorithm has potential benefit to reduce total cost by nearly 1.8% and average simulation time by nearly 1.65% as compared to the harmony search algorithm. Also, in a specific reliability index, the cycle charging strategy has potential benefit to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 11.5% per year and the cost criteria by nearly 7.5% as compared to the load following strategy.

AB There is a great desire to integrate multiple energy systems by forming low-carbon energy hubs. Among various energy platforms, the integration of power and gas networks via Power-to-Gas (PtG) technologies is introduced as a promising solution to enhance the flexibility of power grids and facilitate seamless adoption for high penetration levels of renewable energy resources. In addition, the production of green hydrogen from waste/inexpensive clean electricity has recently been identified as a potential means for large-scale energy storage, deployment of hydrogen mobility, and decarbonization of several processes that utilize hydrogen. As integrated hydrogen-based energy hubs (H 2 Hubs) attract more attention for widespread deployment, the security of such new platforms against various cyberattacks is also becoming a critical topic for investigation. This paper proposes a new data estimation technique, developed and integrated with H 2 Hubs scheduling models, for real -time optimal adaptive collection and organization of the system operating parameters for cybersecurity assessment. A new formulation is presented for the adaptive formation of a newly proposed concept, referred to as the system feasibility area , via real -time acquisition of the system operating information. The created feasibility areas are utilized for real -time post-occurrence detection of the bad scheduling data that is invisible to the existing cybersecurity layers. Numerical studies are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and feasibility of the proposed model. The results demonstrate that the historical data can be adaptively collected in real time and successfully utilized to create feasibility areas to categorize the system operating points.

AB Significantly utilizing cutting-edge information technology in Integrated Energy Systems (IESs), energy conversion control has emerged as a potent tool for increasing grid flexibility and lowering IES running costs. In order to manage the energy of an IES using renewable energy, the study suggests a dynamic energy conversion method with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) hybridization. Thus, it contributes to a novel Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for effective electrical balance regulation in RES-integrated power systems. It is included in Fire Hawk Optimization algorithm-Adaptive Learning Mechanism (FHO-ALM), an Adaptive Learning Mechanism, together with the Fire Hawk Optimization algorithm, allowing DRL agents to adapt to dynamically changing conditions or newly obtained sets of information in IES. Moreover, the work has been accomplished to validate the DRL agent's performance in various scenarios, including times of high demand and bad weather. This validation process will demonstrate the agent's real-time power generation, storage, and conveyance abilities through effortless integration into the real power system's control infrastructure. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the suggested method requires less computing time than the methods that are already in existence. Furthermore, the suggested approach leverages renewable energy sources efficiently and doesn't waste any available energy while producing power for smart grids at a reasonable cost.

AB The integration of electricity and gas systems is a key priority for the energy transition. Alongside electricity, low-carbon energy vectors, such as Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) or hydrogen, are required in future energy systems. Hence, regasification systems, often located nearby port areas, will be strategic assets promoting environmental, social, and economic benefits.
   This study investigates and compares three integrated configurations exploiting LNG cold exergy for the efficient production of electricity in a port area . In all three configurations, electricity is produced by a gas turbine fuelled with regasified natural gas and different combinations of two bottoming cycles, consisting of a transcritical CO2 Rankine cycle and a natural gas direct expansion cycle. These configurations are compared with a traditional regasification and combined cycle power plant. The study aims at identifying the design of the system that maximizes the second law efficiency and the Net Present Value (NPV) for various relative sizes between gas turbine and regasification capacity, including analyses on Internal Rate of Return (IRR). A sensitivity analysis on the installation of turbine inlet air-cooling taking advantage of LNG cold exergy is also performed. The optimization is performed through Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and Aspen Hysys.
   Results show that the mutual size between the gas turbine and regasification unit is an important variable that requires careful analysis, as the second law efficiency can vary between 49% and 42% depending on the case. Electric efficiency of the proposed configurations can approach 65%, thus resulting greater than the traditional combined cycle in most of the test conditions. Economic optimizations confirm that the NPV of two configurations is often 10-15 M(sic) greater than the corresponding value of the base case system; however, only a single configuration can increase the IRR by 1-2% in comparison to the case with separate units. These results can guide designers and developers in the definition of the most cost-effective solution of any integrated energy systems including regasification, similar to a port system, which are expected to be key facilities in the future energy scenario.

AB As an immanent necessity to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, the energy transition poses a major challenge for the next 30 years, as it includes a cross-sectoral increase of fluctuating renewable energy production, grid extension to meet regional electricity supply and demand as well as an increase of energy storage capacity. Within the power-to-gas concept, hydrogen is considered as one of the most promising solutions.
   The paper presents a scenario-based bottom-up approach to analyse the hydrogen supply chain to substitute diesel with fuel cell buses in the Rhine-Main area in central Germany for the year 2025. The analysis is based on field data derived from the 6 MW power-to-gas plant "Energiepark Mainz" and the bus demonstration project "H-2-Bus Rhein-Main". The system is modelled to run simulations on varying demand scenarios. The outcome is minimised hydrogen production costs derived from the optimal scheduling of a power-to-gas plant in terms of the demand. The assessment includes the energy procurement for hydrogen production, different hydrogen delivery options and spatial analysis of potential power-to-gas locations.

AB In the integrated energy systems (IESs), multiple energy sources are coupled, and their spatiotemporal characteristics are different, making the optimal scheduling of the IES extremely difficult. Considering the impact of the randomness of wind power and photovoltaic output on the scheduling plan, an optimal scheduling method of day-ahead, intra-day, and real-time correction for IES is proposed. Firstly, random scenarios of wind power and photovoltaic output are generated based on kernel density estimation and copula function. Secondly, under the optimal scenario, the day-ahead optimal scheduling model is established with the lowest total operating cost of IES as the objective function. For intra-day scheduling, the objective function is to minimize the sum of penalty costs for wind and photovoltaic power abandonment, energy storage equipment, each equipment power change, and the change of power supply. Moreover, considering the difference in response speed of cooling, heating, and power, the power-type energy storage is used to realize short-time power dispatching, and the optimization model of real-time correction is established. Finally, the improved coati optimization algorithm (COA) is used to solve the problem. The simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed strategy.

To give full play to the advantages of battery storage in stabilizing power quality and smoothing the output of intermittent new energy generation, the battery life decay problem needs to be considered in optimal scheduling. In this paper, we studied the energy storage life decay model and established an electric-gas integrated energy system model considering energy storage life decay to minimize the economic cost of system operations and to compare the optimal dispatch results with and without energy storage life decay through simulation analysis to verify the rationality and economy of the energy storage life decay model used in this paper.

AB Given the optimistic future of hydrogen energy in transition toward a low-carbon society, hydrogen subsystem and its role in the optimal energy management of multi-energy microgrids (MEMG) should be considered. Un-certainties of hydrogen vehicles (HVs), demands, wind turbine (WT) and photovoltaic (PV) power output, and prices associated within MEMG can impose regret to the optimality of solution. In this study, a stochastic p-robust optimization approach is developed to cope with uncertainties and obtain an optimal solution for the proposed MEMG while satisfying a robustness criterion. The proposed MEMG considers different energy conversions including power to hydrogen (P2H), hydrogen to power (H2P), hydrogen to gas (H2G), gas to power (G2P) and gas to power and heat (G2He). Additional energy transactions with the external electricity grid as well as liquified natural gas (LNG) are considered and application of renewables and hydrogen storage system (HSS) towards a sustainable isolated MEMG is investigated via the epsilon-constraint approach. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach is evaluated on a case study and results verify that the proposed MEMG is scheduled to be robust and obtain the maximum profit.

AB In recent years, decentralized methods have received growing attentions in the field of optimal scheduling of integrated energy systems (IESs) due to their advantages in independent operation and privacy protection. However, the development of decentralized scheduling strategies is usually challenging and time-consuming in practice. To address this problem, this paper proposes a generic self-organized multi-agent-based decentralized scheduling framework for IESs. Four types of base agent models were defined firstly to characterize the individual benefits of various energy entities in IESs. They could construct customized decentralized scheduling models easily. A topology-based fully-decentralized coordination approach was further presented to resolve the conflicts of individual benefits among agents. The coordination rules could be generated in a selforganized manner according to the topological structure of target IESs. Finally, an improved fullydecentralized alternating direction method of multipliers was developed to achieve the fullydecentralized optimization. Simulation results indicate that the generated strategy can reach satisfactory optimization accuracy and computational efficiency. The relative error of optimal results with the benchmark strategy is lower than 0.02 %, and the computational time is reduced by 46.7 % compared with conventional decentralized strategies. This study provides a generic and cost-effective solution to generate customized decentralized scheduling strategies for various types of IESs.

AB Integrated energy systems (IES), which leverage multiple energy sources synergistically, enhance efficiency, sustainability and resilience. Scheduling is key to optimizing IES operation, typically focusing on source-side components. However, while efforts have been made to synergistic optimization of sources, networks and loads, the impact of network and load on source-side components is often ignored. This is particularly true for combined heat and power IES (CHP-IES), where backwater parameters significantly affect the thermal efficiency of heat-producing components. Misalignments between scheduling models and actual system behavior can reduce optimization accuracy, leading to a decline in economic performance or even infeasible scheduling results. To address this research gap, an optimal source-network-load combined scheduling method is proposed. Specifically, the effect of backwater temperature on thermal efficiency is quantified, analyzed, fitted and incorporated as constraints in the scheduling model, improving the accuracy in reflecting the system's actual characteristics. However, the resulting scheduling problem is a complex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem that cannot be solved centrally within an acceptable time. Therefore, the original problem is decomposed into two subproblems: one for the source-side and one for the network/load-side. A convergence- enhanced distributed optimization approach is introduced to enable efficient coordination between subproblems. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling method, a model predictive control (MPC)based control system is designed for real-time scheduling instruction tracking. A set of operational simulations are carried out based on the IES dynamic mechanistic model. With comparison to two traditional scheduling methods underestimating the impacts of network and load on source-side components, the proposed scheduling method can reduce 95 % and 75 % load tracking deviation respectively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling method in enhancing the reliability of energy supply.

ID FRAMEWORK; DEMAND
AB Integrating a shared energy storage system (SESS) into multiple park integrated energy systems (MPIES) enables flexible capacity selection for each park, considerably enhancing the utilization rate of energy storage equipment. Reasonable capacity configuration and operational strategies for the SESS can harness the advantages of differences and complementarities in the source-load among the parks, thereby meeting various needs of all parties while improving the operational economics. To address this issue, this study proposes a distributed cooperative optimization model for SESS-MPIES that accounts for seasonal variations. First, the proposed model optimizes the SESS's annual profit and minimizes the annual energy costs for each park by using an asymmetric Nash bargaining model, which prioritizes collective benefits while ensuring fairness for individual stakeholders. A distributed parallel optimization framework is then introduced, decomposing the problem into two subproblems using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Variable information within each park is updated in parallel, and an adaptive step-size mechanism improves the solution process's efficiency. Finally, simulations are performed on an integrated energy system comprising three parks and a SESS using MATLAB. The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy reduces the overall annual operating cost of the system by 27 %, with the lifecycle profit rate of the SESS reaching 13.6%. Furthermore, the proposed parallel algorithm notably improves computation speed.

AB In the context of the energy revolution, the new power system is gradually transforming into an energy internet. Sustainability and uncertainty in power systems have become a challenge in energy system planning and operation. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a distributed integrated energy system with an uncertainty scheduling problem. First, the distribution and transmission processes of the electricity-gas-hydrogen system are finely modeled, with the energy system being an electricity-gas transmission network and a multi-energy flow energy hub distribution network. Afterward, an ambiguity set is generated based on historical data and Latin hypercube sampling to construct a multi-energy power system with data-model-driven distributionally robust chance-constrained optimization for system cost minimization. Finally, the computable distributionally robust chance constraint expression is established from historical data. The comparative analysis of the arithmetic example shows that the system self-sufficiency is improved by 3.74%, carbon emission is reduced by 2.26%, and the total cost is reduced by 9.87%.

AB Existing research has not adequately accounted for the nonlinear characteristics and degradation of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and lacks a systematic approach to handling internal uncertainties. To address this, this paper proposes a hierarchical economic dispatch method for integrated energy systems (IES) that incorporates the degradation costs of SOFC and uncertainties from both internal and external sources. Firstly, this paper employs a system-level electrochemical-thermodynamic coupled (ETC) modeling approach for SOFCs and exchange membrane electrolyzer (PEMEC). It characterizes the operational characteristics and thermodynamic processes of SOFCs at different operating temperatures and subsequently derives the degradation costs associated with SOFCs. Secondly, the concept of internal uncertainty is introduced, and a hierarchical scheduling framework is established to mitigate uncertainties at the day-ahead and intra-day time scales progressively. In the day-ahead layer, the ETC model is treated with piecewise linearization and an hourly dispatch plan is obtained based on short-term forecast data; in the intra-day layer, the ETC model is processed with local linearization, and rolling optimization is conducted based on ultra-short-term forecast data. Furthermore, a feedback correction link is utilized to maintain the power balance within the IES. Finally, the proposed approach is tested in an IES case study, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the scheme.

AB Transitioning to Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems (HRES) is essential for a sustainable, low-carbon future. This systematic review evaluates progress in hydrogen, biomass, biogas, and solar photovoltaics (PV) and emphasizes their significance in hybrid energy frameworks. A thorough analysis of 174 research articles was performed using VOSviewer, categorizing the literature into seven themes: "Renewable Energy Technologies and Transition", "Advanced Bioenergy and Optimization", "Integrated Energy Systems and Hydrogen Technologies", "Energy Systems Management and Optimization", "Sustainable Energy Fundamentals", "Innovations in Hydrogen and Sustainable Energy", and "Biohydrogen and Biomass Technologies". The review results revealed that integrating hydrogen, advancing bioenergy, implementing AI-driven energy management, and utilizing hybrid storage solutions are crucial for enhancing energy efficiency and grid stability. High costs, intermittency challenges, and regulatory hurdles hamper large-scale implementation. Addressing these issues through policy initiatives and innovative technologies can expedite the rollout of HRES, promoting a clean, resilient, and energy-secure future.

AB In this article, the energy management of the intelligent distribution system with charging stations for battery-based electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid EVs, hydrogen station for fuel cell-based EVs, and renewable integrated energy systems (IESs) with hydrogen storage devices in accordance with the estimation of economic, operational, security and environmental goals of distribution system operator is presented. Hydrogen storage is used to store electric energy and feed hydrogen consumers. The methodology adopted here is expressed as a multi-objective formulation to be solved. Objective functions are minimizing the cost of buying energy by distribution system from the upstream network, minimizing distribution system energy losses, minimizing environmental emissions, and maximizing voltage security in the distribution system. In this issue, AC power flow model, operation and voltage security boundaries in the network, performance model of charging station for EVs, hydrogen station model for fuel cell vehicles, and renewable IES operation model with hydrogen storage is the boundaries specific to the problem. The problem in the single-objective model uses the Pareto optimization that relies on the sum of weighted functions method. Next, the fuzzy decision-making technique extracts an optimal compromised solution between the operational, economic, security and environmental objectives of the network operator. In the present scheme, load, energy prices, renewable phenomena, electric vehicles have uncertainty. In this article, stochastic optimization based on Unscented Transform is incorporated to provide a suitable modeling of the uncertain parameters appearing in the problem. Modelling of the performance of EVs charging station and hydrogen fulling station, using hydrogen storage as electricity energy storage and feeding hydrogen loads, energy management of renewable bio-waste and tidal units in IES, considering the different objectives of network operator, and using Unscented Transform approach to model of uncertainty parameters are the innovations of this article. Findings show that the method improves the technical, environmental and economic conditions of the grid, and the integrated system with its optimal performance is able to enhance the economic, environmental, security and operation status of the distribution system up to roughly 45.8%, 38%, 32-45% and 10.6%, respectively.

AB The ever-growing demand for energy in remote areas and hard-to-reach territories requires sustainable and reliable solutions for electricity and heat supply. Currently, there is a partial transition to decentralized energy production, which allows creating local intelligent energy systems. These systems are located in close proximity to consumption nodes, which increases the reliability of energy supply. The hybrid system presented in the study includes a gas turbine, wind turbines, solar panels, a fuel cell, and an electrolyzer. The system effectively converts excess wind and solar energy into hydrogen in off-peak modes of operation and uses the resulting hydrogen in a gas turbine and a fuel cell during periods of demand. The aim of the study is to develop a concept for creating a hydrogen microdistrict through the effective use of hydrogen technologies in the production of electricity as part of hybrid systems. The paper considers the strategy of electricity and heat supply for a microdistrict with a population of about 6000 people. The strategies of electricity and heat supply are presented taking into account real actual energy consumption indicators (hourly load schedules). The presented concept of developing hybrid technologies during implementation considers the use of Russian equipment. The presence of manufacturing plants producing the full range of equipment for creating hybrid systems allows not only the implementation of pilot projects for microdistricts, but also the development of a long-term program for the creation of such microdistricts in remote areas of the Russian Federation.

AB In integrated energy systems, stochastic variations of different energy types of loads and the increasing penetration of renewable energy generation have resulted in considerable uncertainties. These uncertainties pose significant challenges to the economics and safe operation of integrated energy systems. Conventional deterministic methods of optimal dispatch overlook the effects of uncertainties, while stochastic optimization, though accounting for uncertainties, often yields conservative solutions that may adversely affect the economic operations. Chance-constrained optimization can effectively deal with uncertainties and provide more flexibility in balancing operational risks and benefits by expanding the feasible region. Hence, this paper proposes a chance-constrained optimal dispatch method for integrated energy systems and employs data-driven sparse polynomial chaos expansion method to enhance solving efficiency. First, the proposed chance-constrained optimization aims to ensure the optimal economic operation with an affordable security confidence level that balances safety and economics compared with deterministic and stochastic optimizations. The introduced data-driven sparse polynomial chaos expansion method enables the fast computing of the output response using only historical data, i.e., without knowledge pertaining to the distribution functions. Moreover, an improved iterative verification structure is proposed, which further improves the convergence speed and accuracy. Finally, the advantages and feasibility of the proposed method are verified using a test case and compared with those of deterministic and stochastic optimization. Results show that the proposed method successfully reduces the operational cost and controls violation probability.

AB With the rise of integrated energy systems, the load aggregator's role in forming a connection between the demand and supply sides has been gaining increasing importance. Traditional demand response has gradually developed into integrated demand response. Considering consumer psychology, a bilateral integrated demand response model between the integrated energy production base, load aggregator, and users is established; the model is a hierarchical Stackelberg game. Simultaneously, a mixed integer quadratic programming-multi-verse optimizer distributed algorithm is proposed to solve the game model. During the continuous interactive gaming process, the utilities of all parties can be maximized while achieving a balance of benefits. Considering whether price incentives should be implemented and including consumers' psychological characteristics, three scenarios were established for case analysis. The results show that the proposed trading strategy can increase the benefits of the integrated energy production base, load aggregator, and users by 5%, 4%, and 23%, respectively. In addition, the penalty cost of abandoning wind and solar power and of power reserve capacity are reduced by $34.4 and $9, respectively. The introduction of the hierarchical game model ensures the sustainability of the mechanism and provides innovative ideas for the development of integrated energy systems. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB After proposing the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality target, China further proposed a series of specific carbon emission growth limit sub-targets. How to decarbonize the energy system to ensure the realization of the carbon growth limit sub-targets is a meaningful topic. At present, generation expansion planning of renewable energy in integrated energy systems has been well studied. However, few of the existing studies consider specific carbon emission growth targets. To address this research gap, a two-stage robust generation expansion planning framework for regional integrated energy systems with carbon growth constraints is proposed in this paper, which takes into account multiple uncertainties. In this framework, the objective function is to minimize the total operation cost and wind turbine investment cost. The first stage is the decision-making level of the wind turbine capacity configuration scheme. The second stage is the optimal economic dispatching in the worst-case scenario, which is a bi-level problem of max-min form. Thus, the two-stage robust optimization framework constitutes a problem of min-max-min form, which is pretty hard to solve directly with a commercial solver. Therefore, a nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm is adopted and nested iterations are performed to solve the complex problem. Finally, case studies are carried out on a regional electric-gas integrated energy system. The MATLAB/YALMIP simulation platform with the Gurobi solver is used to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework. Compared with other four cases, 5,000 Monte Carlo scheduling tests demonstrate that the proposed framework can ensure the system carbon emission to be controlled within a certain limit even in the worst scenario. Due to the consideration of multiple uncertainties, the proposed framework planning results are both robust and economical for investment. This study can provide theoretical support for the actual regional integrated energy system to achieve a certain carbon growth target.

AB I recent years, the development of electric vehicles (EV) has provided new ideas for electricity storage in integrated energy systems (IES). Exploring the differences between EV and battery storage (BS) in electrical storage performance is of great significance for the efficient operation of IES. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison is performed in this paper. A case study is conducted on an energy-integrated community with four functional areas. A two-layer optimization model is proposed to optimize the systems' design and operation. The mathematical and optimization models are solved based on Sequential Quadratic Programming and CPLEX solver with MATLAB. The results show that both systems can shift peak loads and smooth IES load. In contrast, the IES with EV is more flexible, with EVs carrying 21-65 % of the electrical load, while BS only carries 3-6 %. Because of lower investment and operating costs, the annual cost of IES with EV is 12-24 % lower than that with BS. In terms of environmental benefits, the annual CO2 emission of IES with EV in residential area is reduced by 19 %. But it increases by 21-39 % in office, commercial and medical areas due to the lower installed capacity in PVs. In particular, IES with EV in residential areas has the best economic and environmental benefits with 24 % reduction in annual costs and 19 % in CO2 emission, but it has the worst economic performance in medical areas and the worst environmental benefits in office areas. The conclusions obtained in this paper can provide reference for the design of electricity storage equipment in IES.

ID ELECTRICITY
AB The power to gas (P2G) equipment serves as a critical linkage in integrated energy systems that foster bidirectional energy flow to enhance the share of renewable energy and curb uncertainty. By bringing together P2G hydrogen production and hydrogen injection into gas grid technology, the energy conversion loss associated with P2G applications can be significantly reduced. Nonetheless, the strict criteria concerning hydrogen blending ratios pose limitations on the integration of renewable energy. This paper proposes a comprehensive energy system model that couples gas grid hydrogen injection with a hybrid P2G process, aiming to reduce energy conversion losses and overcome the constraints posed by hydrogen blending ratios. This approach promotes the efficient utilization of renewable energy in integrated energy systems (IES). For wind power uncertainty, a scenario analysis method combining Latin hypercube sampling and scenario curtailment 0 - 1 algorithm is employed. The model ' s nonlinear constraints are linearized through piecewise linearization, transforming the problem into a mixed-integer programming one for solution simulation results demonstrate that the application of the hybrid P2G process in IES systems with hydrogen injection into gas grid technology reduces certain energy conversion stages and cost inputs compared to using only power to hydrogen conversion. This approach shows significant improvements in economic and environmental performance. The hybrid P2G scheme reduces the hydrogen blending ratio of the system to the minimum operating cost from 12 % to 6 %. At the same time, its minimum value is 20.1 thousand USD lower than that of the scheme using only power to hydrogen conversion, which is about 4.7 % of the total cost.

In order to break the information islands phenomenon and realize the unified management of electric-gas-heat integrated energy system, this paper thoroughly analyses the composition and characteristics of the electricity-gas-heat integrated energy system and extends the common information model by using object-oriented modeling concept based on the IEC 61970 to meet the needs of integrated energy systems, such as multi-energy flow calculation, optimal scheduling, and operational control. The complete extended model of natural gas system, thermal system, coupling links and multi-energy storage systems is built. In addition, the attributes of key classes in the electricity-gas-heat integrated energy system are described, such as the classes of natural gas source, natural gas transporting unit, natural gas pipeline, natural gas load, motor-driven compressor, power-to-gas unit, power-to-heat unit, natural gas storage system, thermal storage system and hydrogen storage system. The extended common information model of electricity-gas-heat integrated energy system is built under the Rational Rose platform and an example verification is carried out to generate XML file and partial code of header file and source file in order to test the rationality of the extended common information model.

AB Integrated energy systems (IESs) can make full use of renewable energy and have become a development trend of future energy due to their high energy efficiency. This study aims to investigate the economic, efficiency and environmental performance of electric-thermal coupling IESs operating at different latitudes. First, multi-energy integrated systems for commercial buildings are modelled, which presumably operate in Xi'an, Guangzhou and Harbin. The optimal component sizes of these systems are calculated separately using the region contraction algorithm with the objective of the lowest energy cost. In this work, simulation is implemented through the commercial software tool MATLAB. On this basis, a comprehensive evaluation method is presented to evaluate the performance of IESs in the aspects of economic, environmental and efficiency performance. In addition to a comparison with common systems, IESs in different regions are also analyzed, providing a reference for the planning and evaluation of IESs. The results show that the solar radiation and required loads at various geographical latitudes are different, which leads to the diversity of optimal capacity in different cities. In low latitudes such as Guangzhou, the system component sizes are relatively small, in contrast to the results at high latitudes. The system can obtain a low cost of electricity and high cost of heat in low latitudes, but a high cost of electricity and low cost of heat are usually calculated in high latitudes. Moreover, the system has excellent environmental and efficiency performance but poor economic performance in high latitudes, while the system exhibits the opposite results in low latitudes. The above analysis results reflect that the contrast among environmental, efficiency and economic performance needs to be further considered in component sizing optimization and construction of IESs.

AB With increasing dual pressure from global large energy consumption and environmental protection, multiple integrated energy systems (IESs) can provide more effective ways to achieve better energy utilization performance. However, in actual circumstances, many challenges have been brought to coupling multiple energy sources along with the uncertainty of each generated power to achieve efficient operation of IESs. To resolve this problem, this article reviews primary research on integrated energy optimization and scheduling technology to give constructive guidance in power systems. Firstly, the conceptual composition and classification of IESs are presented. Secondly, the coupling relationship between multiple energy sources based on mathematical expression is studied deeply. Thirdly, the scheduling of IESs with different types and regions is classified, analyzed, and summarized for clarification. Fourthly, on this basis, potential solutions for applications of key optimization technologies involved in the scheduling process in IESs can be found systematically. Finally, the future development trends to optimize scheduling integrated energy systems is explored and prospected in depth.

AB In city-integrated energy systems containing electric-thermal multi-energy sources, the uncertainty of renewable energy sources and the fluctuation of loads challenge the safe, efficient, economic and stable operation of the integrated energy systems. This paper introduces a novel approach for the operation of a carbon capture plant/CHP with PV accommodation within a city-integrated energy system. The proposed strategy aims to maximize the utilization of photovoltaic (PV) power generation and carbon capture equipment, addressing issues related to small-scale CHP climbing constraints and short-term output regulation. Additionally, this paper presents a multi-timescale optimal scheduling strategy, which effectively addresses deviations caused by PV fluctuations and load changes. This was achieved through a detailed analysis of the CHP climbing constraints, carbon capture equipment operation and real-time characteristics of PV power generation. This paper introduces a fully distributed neural dynamics-based optimization algorithm designed to address multi-timescale optimization challenges. Utilizing rolling cycles, this algorithm computes both day-ahead and real-time scheduling outcomes for urban integrated energy systems. Theoretical analyses and numerical simulations were conducted to validate the precision and efficacy of the proposed model and algorithm. These analyses quantitatively evaluate the scheduling performance of PV power generation and carbon capture CHP systems across various timescales.

AB This paper presents an analytical approach for the optimal operation of battery-integrated energy systems (BIES). Energy profile sectionalizing, achieved through the offline studies, is proposed in this paper as a framework for optimal energy dispatch in BIES, and an online strategy is then explained to control the energy system optimally. In this paper, a general framework of the battery control is addressed with considering battery characteristics and system electricity tariffs to make the proposed method applicable to real cases. Applying the proposed method to BIES shows great advantages in optimal battery scheduling as it guarantees to achieve the global optimal operation of the battery considering its actual parameters compared to the previous studies focusing on the use of optimization methods whose outputs are near-optimal solutions. Real load profile and electricity prices are used to test the proposed approach through a developed code in MATLAB software. The results show that the cost of the energy system and calculation burden of achieving optimal results are decreased compared with using the genetic algorithm (GA) and harmony search algorithm (HSA).

AB With dynamic changes in the energy market and continuous advances in smart energy technology, regional integrated energy systems (RIESs) have emerged as a vital direction in the evolution of energy systems. They are increasingly gaining significance in the realm of energy supply (ES) and demand response initiatives. In this context, this article introduces a novel optimal operational model for an integrated energy system (IES) that incorporates energy price responsiveness. The paper commences by delivering a comprehensive overview of the typical structure of an IES, presenting detailed models for each system module, encompassing the electrical energy supplier, heating, and cooling components. The proposed system model comprises three distinct subsystems, each catering to specific energy requirements. The primary emphasis is on devising an efficient planning scheme tailored to the energy consumption patterns and operational aspects of the IES. Through the presented model, there is substantial potential for significantly reducing the overall system cost without inducing a noteworthy upsurge in environmental pollution. Moreover, the energy efficiency of the system can experience considerable enhancement. The desired optimization problem has been solved using the proposed multiobjective Horse Herd Optimization Algorithm (MOHHOA). Additionally, in this strategy, Pareto front and fuzzy selection are employed to make better decisions among all Pareto solutions. The optimization strategy devised in this research not only enables the integrated operation of the IES but also ensures its compatibility with ongoing energy development initiatives. The proposed method yields a diverse set of Pareto solutions across the objective space, providing various trade-offs between economic, environmental, and reliability considerations. Utilizing MOHHOA, the algorithm efficiently balances exploration and exploitation during optimization, resulting in informed decision-making. In optimal planning, Scenario 2 exhibits lower operational costs (8.2 % reduction) and a dramatic improvement in LESP (1.24 % - 1.176 %) compared to Scenario 1. Sensitivity analysis reveals an 11.2 % increase in environmental costs in Scenario 1 with a 36 % rise in electricity prices. Conversely, in Scenario 2, a 10 % reduction in natural gas prices leads to a 24.5 % increase in system running costs. These findings underscore the significance of considering energy price fluctuations for optimizing integrated energy system performance.

AB The high penetrability of renewable energy and the increasing demand for hydrogen energy pose challenges to system scheduling and the accommodation of photovoltaic and wind power. Therefore, a data-driven multienergy economic scheduling method with experiential knowledge bases is proposed to enhance system operational efficiency and economic performance. Firstly, the Wasserstein generative adversarial network is used to enhance wind power and photovoltaic historical samples. The K-medoids clustering algorithm and & phi;-divergence are applied to achieve scenario reduction and acquire fuzzy sets, eliminating the need for assumptions about their probability distributions. Secondly, a kernel density estimation is used to improve the accuracy of characterizing the probability distribution of energy loads. Based on fuzzy sets, the distributionally robust optimization is used to achieve optimal scheduling in an integrated electricity-hydrogen-heat system. This technique enhances the accommodation capacity of photovoltaic and wind power while reducing operational costs. Finally, a decision-making technique based on an experiential knowledge base is studied, aiming to swiftly match corresponding decision variables by evaluating the similarity of labeled state variables. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the decision-making speed by about 0.8 times and reduces operating costs and photovoltaic or wind power curtailment by at least 1%. The method can provide fast and efficient day-ahead economic scheduling for digitized integrated energy systems.

AB Research and development on integrated energy systems such as cogeneration and trigeneration to improve the efficiency of thermal energy as well as fuel utilisation have been a key focus of attention by researchers. Total Site Utility Integration is an established methodology for the synergy and integration of utility recovery among multiple processes. However, Total Site Cooling, Heating and Power (TSCHP) integration methods involving trigeneration systems for industrial plants have been much less emphasised. This paper proposes a novel methodology for developing an insight-based numerical Pinch Analysis technique to simultaneously target the minimum cooling, heating and power requirements for a total site energy system. It enables the design of an integrated centralised trigeneration system involving several industrial sites generating the same utilities. The new method is called the Trigeneration System Cascade Analysis (TriGenSCA). The procedure for TriGenSCA involves data extraction, constructions of a Problem Table Algorithm (PTA), Multiple Utility Problem Table Algorithm (MU PTA), Total Site Problem Table Algorithm (TS PTA) and estimation of energy sources by a trigeneration system followed by construction of TriGenSCA, Trigeneration Storage Cascade Table (TriGenSCT) and construction of a Total Site Utility Distribution (TSUD) Table. The TriGenSCA tool is vital for users to determine the optimal size of utilities for generating power, heating and cooling in a trigeneration power plant. Based on the case study, the base fuel source for power, heating and cooling is nuclear energy with a demand load of 72 GWh/d supplied by 10.8 t of Uranium-235. Comparison between conventional PWR producing power, heating and cooling seperately, and trigeneration PWR system with and without integration have been made. The results prove that PWR as a trigeneration system is the most cost-effective, enabling 28% and 17% energy savings as compared to conventional PWR producing power, heating and cooling separately.

AB Hydrogen-blended electricity-gas integrated energy system (EG-IES) utilizes surplus renewable energy power generation to blends hydrogen into the natural gas pipeline network for achieve efficient and economical large-scale hydrogen consumption and long-distance transportation. While enhancing the coupling between the power grid and gas grid, the scheduling control of such a complex system becomes increasingly important. The paper presents a dynamic model of a hydrogen blended EG-IES with high renewable energy permeability, and a modeling method that considers distribution parameters of the natural gas pipeline is obtained by using the cell segmentation and calculating the blended gas composition in real-time to avoid the assumption of constant composition. After the validation against available operational data, a case study of the certain area of Central China is simulated. The coordinate control law is reasonably designed according to the dynamic characteristics of EG-IES and the objective of realizing the load increase within the hydrogen concentration constraint, and the PID is utilized as the benchmark to compare dynamic performance. The results demonstrate that the coordinated control based on the alternate adjustment control law has no overshoot and shorter adjustment time of p(l )and epsilon about 33% and 42% than benchmark on the large delay system.

AB Green hydrogen from renewable sources can be blended with natural gas and serves as a potentially feasible measure for contributing to the net zero energy sector. The time-varying nature of hydrogen injection, influenced by stochastic renewable generations, can result in fluctuations in gas concentrations in the entire network. It poses a potential threat to the secure regulation of integrated electricity and gas systems (IEGS). For managing the operating condition and guaranteeing the security of IEGS during operation, a multi-period operation framework with alternative gas (e.g., hydrogen) blending is developed. First, a convex gas security range is derived using the Dutton method. Then, the multi-period operation framework is devised to mitigate the impacts of alternative gas injection on gas security over the entire operational period. Both the dynamics from gas composition and gas flow are modelled, accurately describing the real-time travel of alternative gas concentrations. The dynamics in the gas mixture properties (e.g., relative density) are fully revealed with time- varying gas concentrations. To tackle the high non-convexities in the optimization problem, second-order-cone relaxation is well-tailored and firstly used in the case of varying gas compositions, making the motion equations and advective transport equations more tractable. An advanced second-order-cone sequential programming is devised to drive the relaxation tight more efficiently. Finally, our operation strategy is illustrated in IEEE and Belgium Electricity and Gas Systems. Results indicate that hydrogen concentrations take about 12.5 h to travel from the injection point to the end of the pipeline route in the Belgium gas system. By incorporating this unique characteristic into the model, operational scheduling and dispatch in IEGS can be more practical when integrating hydrogen in the future.

AB Integrated energy systems are gradually promoted and constructed. As energy hubs, the integrated energy systems operated by energy service providers couple different energy systems to realize flexible conversion of multiple energy, promote the renewable energy consumption and reduce carbon emissions. To promote cooperation among service providers of different scales and fully exploit the advantages of integrated energy systems in economic and clean energy utilization, an asymmetric Nash bargaining based day-ahead energy sharing strategy for integrated energy service providers is proposed in this paper. The day-ahead energy sharing problem is decomposed into energy sharing scheme formulation problem and energy sharing benefits settlement problem. To meet the privacy protection requirements of service providers, these problems are addressed by parallel distributed optimization algorithm. In sharing benefits settlement problem, a non-linear mapping function is proposed to calculate bargaining weights of service providers and distribute sharing benefits. Finally, simulation results show that the energy sharing strategy can maximize the benefits of each integrated service provider and the sharing alliance of them. With the fair distribution of sharing benefits, the sharing strategy incentivizes the active participation of service providers in sharing. The simulation results also show that energy sharing and demand response can further make full use of renewable energy, reduce the dependence on coal-fired power. The carbon emissions in the process of energy consumption are effectively reduced.

AB The emergence of renewable-energy-source (RES) envelope solutions, building retrofit requirements and advanced energy technologies brought about challenges to the existing paradigm of urban energy systems. It is envisioned that the building cluster approach-that can maximize the synergies of RES harvesting, building performance, and distributed energy management-will deliver the breakthrough to these challenges. Thus, this paper aims to critically review urban energy systems at the cluster level that incorporate building integrated RES solutions. We begin with defining cluster approach and the associated boundaries. Several factors influencing energy planning at cluster scale are identified, while the most important ones are discussed in detail. The closely reviewed factors include RES envelope solutions, solar energy potential, density of buildings, energy demand, integrated cluster-scale energy systems and energy hub. The examined categories of RES envelope solutions are (i) the solar power, (ii) the solar thermal and (iii) the energy-efficient ones, out of which solar energy is the most prevalent RES. As a result, methods assessing the solar energy potentials of building envelopes are reviewed in detail. Building density and the associated energy use are also identified as key factors since they affect the type and the energy harvesting potentials of RES envelopes. Modelling techniques for building energy demand at cluster level and their coupling with complex integrated energy systems or an energy hub are reviewed in a comprehensive way. In addition, the paper discusses control and operational methods as well as related optimization algorithms for the energy hub concept. Based on the findings of the review, we put forward a matrix of recommendations for cluster-level energy system simulations aiming to maximize the direct and indirect benefits of RES envelope solutions. By reviewing key factors and modelling approaches for characterizing RES-envelope-solutions-based urban energy systems at cluster level, this paper hopes to foster the transition towards more sustainable urban energy systems.

AB Accurate short-term multi-energy load forecasting is an essential prerequisite for ensuring the reliable and economic operation of integrated energy systems (IES). Considering the large fluctuations, strong randomness, and the multi-energy coupling relationship of regional IES, this paper proposes a novel short-term multi-energy load forecasting method based on a CNN-BiGRU model that is optimized by attention mechanism. First, the dynamic coupling relationship between multi-energy loads is qualitatively analyzed, and the influencing factors of multi-energ loads are screened based on data-driven analysis. Second, a one-dimensional CNN layer is formulated to extract complex high-dimensional features, and BiGRU is constructed to extract the time dependence from historical sequences. In particular, three attention mechanism modules are introduced to the BiGRU hidden state through the mapping weight and learning parameter matrix to enhance the impact of key information. Then, hard weight sharing is adopted to extract the inherent multi-energy coupling relationship. Finally, a novel multi-task loss function weight optimization method is applied to search for the optimal multi-task weight, which is used to balance multi-task learning (MTL) to achieve the optimization of the overall forecasting model. To validate the effectiveness of the CNN-BiGRU-Attention MTL model with loss function optimization, this paper compares the proposed model with five benchmark models by MAPE, RMSE, MAE, R2, and computational time. Compared with the traditional LSTM model, the cooling, heat, and electrical load forecasting accuracy (measured by MAPE) of the proposed hybrid model increased by 61.86%, 73.03%, and 63.39%, respectively, which demonstrates that the proposed model exhibits superior performance.

TI Hydrogen Electrolysis in Refineries
SO OIL GAS-EUROPEAN MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Shell and ITM Power will build the world's largest hydrogen electrolysis plant at the Shell Rheinland Refinery in the Cologne area, Germany. With a peak capacity of 10 MW, the hydrogen will be used for the processing and upgrading of products at the refinery's Wesseling site as well as testing the technology and exploring applications in other sectors. The European partner consortium of Shell, ITM Power, SINTEF, thinkstep and Element Energy is supported by the European Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU). The project, named "REFHYNE", started in January 2018 and is scheduled to be in operation by 2020 after two years of design, permitting, construction and commissioning. It will be the first industrial scale test of the polymer electrolyte membrane technology process.
   This new unit at the Rheinland Refinery enables hydrogen to be made from electricity rather than from natural gas. A unit of this kind brings flexibility that can help stabilise the refinery power grid, thereby facilitating the use of renewable electricity. In addition, if powered by renewable electricity, the green hydrogen will help reduce the carbon intensity of the site and of the transport fuels produced in the refinery. Currently the Rheinland Refinery, Germany's largest refinery, processes approximately 180,000 t of hydrogen annually. The hydrogen is produced by steam reforming from natural gas. The 10 MW electrolyser will enable the production of an additional 1300 t of hydrogen per year, which can be fully integrated into the refinery processes, such as for the desulphurization of conventional fuels.
   Hydrogen has the potential to play an important role in the energy transition. Today, hydrogen is already being used in transport by fuel cell vehicles, as well as in industrial applications. When used in transport, hydrogen can also help improve local air quality, as the only emission of fuel cell vehicles is water vapor.

AB Integrated energy systems have become an area of interest as with growing energy demand globally, means of producing sustainable energy from flexible sources is key to meet future energy demands while keeping carbon emissions low. Hydrogen is a potential solution for providing flexibility in the future energy mix as it does not emit harmful gases when used as an energy source. In this paper, an integrated energy system including hydrogen as an energy vector and hydrogen storage is studied. The system is used to assess the behaviour of a hydrogen production and storage system under different renewable energy generation profiles. Two case studies are considered: a high renewable energy generation scenario and a low renewable energy generation scenario. These provide an understanding of how different levels of renewable penetration may affect the operation of an electrolyser and a fuel cell against an electricity import/export pricing regime. The mathematical model of the system under study is represented using the energy hub approach, with system optimisation through linear programming conducted via MATLAB to minimise the total operational cost. The work undertaken showcases the unique interactions the fuel cell has with the hydrogen storage system in terms of minimising grid electricity import and exporting stored hydrogen as electricity back to the grid when export prices are competitive.

AB This study proposes the modeling and the performance assessment of a grid-connected Reversible Solid Oxide Cell (rSOC) plant that is the core system of a polygeneration flexible hub between the national electric grid and the local microgrid of an urban residential district. The system is designed to integrate a thermal storage unit based on phase change material with the rSOC stack by mzedeans of heat pipes. At times of low electricity price, the plant produces hydrogen via electrolysis fed preferentially by a dedicated wind farm. Hydrogen is stored as compressed gas and used for the public transportation and electricity production during peak-demand hours. The goal of the study is to investigate the performance and environmental indicators of this novel rSOC configuration and to identify which operating strategy best fits with the analyzed district application. The operating points of the overall system are mapped with a steady-state model and interfaced with thermal storage and loads by a time-resolved dynamic model. The feasible schedules of the system are defined considering the rSOC switching dynamics between fuel cell and electrolysis, and constraints on plant self-sufficiency for both heat and hydrogen vectors. Simulations at different levels of hydrogen demand for mobility (ranging between 10 and 1,000 ton/year) were performed. Results showed an annual efficiency range of 55-70% (including heat to DH) of the polygeneration plant. The environmental analysis showed that the rSOC plant emits 5-50% less CO2 than the current energy system (gas boilers, grid electricity, diesel buses), when electrolysis is fed by grid-electricity with the present UK carbon intensity in case of wind power shortages.

AB This research presents the best power management of flexible-renewable integrated energy systems (FRIESs) with smart distribution networks (SDNs) by taking nonlinear load harmonic compensation into account. A deterministic model that optimizes for three distinct goals serves as the foundation for the proposed system. The goal is to minimize the combined impact of the network's operational costs, energy losses, and voltage harmonic distortion, taking into account their respective weights. In the FRIES framework, the goal function serves as a constraint on the operation of flexible and renewable sources, as well as the AC optimum harmonic power flow model. The suggested design is first formulated using nonlinear programming, and it is then approximated to a linear model in order to quickly arrive at the one and only optimum solution to the issue by different solvers. Furthermore, there is inherent uncertainty in the design of this work about the output power of renewable sources, load demand, energy consumption of mobile storage devices, and energy costs. Adaptive robust optimization has been applied to develop solutions that effectively address these uncertainties. Ultimately, the results show that, even with the aforementioned uncertainties, the SDN operation is resilient up to a maximum prediction error of 45%. Furthermore, if the distribution substation power factor is maintained at or above 0.9, the worst-case implemented design may enhance the network's energy losses, voltage profile, and harmonic status by 8.2%, 43.5%, and 51.2%, respectively, as compared to load flow studies.

ID UNIT COMMITMENT; OPTIMIZATION
AB The application of gas turbines and power to gas equipment deepens the coupling relationship between power systems and natural gas systems and provides a new way to absorb the uncertain wind power as well. The traditional stochastic optimization and robust optimization algorithms have some limitations and deficiencies in dealing with the uncertainty of wind power output. Therefore, we propose a robust stochastic optimization (RSO) model to solve the dynamic optimal power flow model for electricity-gas integrated energy systems (IES) considering wind power uncertainty, where the ambiguity set of wind power output is constructed based on Wasserstein distance. Then, the Wasserstein ambiguity set is affined to the eventwise ambiguity set, and the proposed RSO model is transformed into a mixed-integer programming model, which can be solved rapidly and accurately using commercial solvers. Numerical results for EG-4 and EG-118 systems verify the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed model.

AB The heat and electricity integrated energy systems (HE-IESs) have a bright prospect in future energy systems owing to their excellent economic and environmental performance. Many uncertain factors in the HE-IESs, such as renewable energy sources, electrical load, and weather factors, threaten the secure and economical operation of systems as well as the thermal comfort of end-users. In this article, the uncertainties that affect the thermal comfort of end-users are modeled comprehensively, including building parameters, weather factors, and human behavior. Then, a two-stage adaptive robust economic dispatch (ARED) model with a robust thermal comfort management strategy is proposed for the operation of HE-IESs, where different policies are adopted to deal with multiple uncertainties based on their different properties. The ARED model is four-level programming with a static robust inner problem, making it computationally intractable. Hence, a sampling-based approximation method is proposed for the robust inner problem to convert the ARED model into a two-stage robust optimization with a linear recourse problem, and then the column-and-constraint generation method is used to solve it. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Due to the rising tensions surrounding the energy industry in response to the depletion of non-renewable energy sources and pollution of the environment, it is especially important to improve the energy utilization rate of integrated energy systems (IESs). Exergy is an important index to measure energy quality. Therefore, this paper proposes an IES operation optimization method based on exergy analysis and an adaptive genetic algorithm. First, based on the energy network theory, a unified expression of the exergy transfer process is given, and the energy level factor is introduced to evaluate the energy quality. Second, the steady-state expression of different forms of exergy in the energy transfer line is given. Third, the exergy economic model of the IES is established by combining exergy analysis, and the solution process of the adaptive genetic algorithm is given. Finally, the operation optimization simulation and analysis of an IES in Bali are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the exergy analysis method and feasibility of the simulation method.

AB This paper proposes a stochastic programming for the economic operation of an electric/hydrogen refueling station. To reduce the carbon footprint, the charging station is connected to solar power generation, electrolyzer, and fuel-cell device to interlink the electric and hydrogen energies. Extra hydrogen is procured through an innovative steam methane reform process, which charges additional gas prices and emission penalties in return. The optimal scheduling minimizes the operation cost of the charging station and the emissions produced. The decision-maker faces uncertainties of electricity price, solar power generation, and vehicle demand that are modeled using stochastic programming. The innovative method based on conditional value-at-risk method is proposed to develop risk-hedging strategies addressing financial risks using economic management. With this respect, the risk -aversion strategies increased the expected cost from $ 322.97 to $ 388.71 (about 17 %) and decreased the difference between the expected cost and the cost of the worst scenario from $ 78.04 to $ 12.30 (about 84.23 %). Moreover, expected risk reduced from $ 24.63 to $ 1.23.

AB Though seismic hazards are infrequent, their occurrence can lead to severe destruction. To understand how lowprobability, high-impact seismic hazards would affect the stability of integrated energy systems (IES), this paper develops a seismic-resilient integrated energy system (SRIES) design optimization model. The model employs a bi-level Monte Carlo method to capture the low probability of seismic scenarios, monetize the hazard damage, and stochastically optimize IES design and operation. A representative case study in Fujian Province, a region frequently affected by seismic activity in the Taiwan Strait, reveals that: (1) incorporating seismic hazards into IES design leads to a 2% increase in net present cost, with 98% of this increment attributed to hazard-induced unmet energy demands; (2) as the resilience requirement increases, the investment-effectiveness for resilience reinforcement initially rises and then declines, indicating a clear turning point between the costs of resilience reinforcement and its associated benefits; (3) among all technologies within an IES, the electricity grid and combined heating and power (CHP) contribute the most to the system's resilience. Overall, this study is expected to provide quantitative insights for the seismic-resilient design of IES.

AB To address the balancing challenge of real-time power demand and supply in power systems caused by unpredictable output fluctuations of renewable energies, collaborative and effective scheduling of integrated energy systems is proposed with consideration for carbon restrictions. The model incorporates various energy resources, including cold, heat, electricity, and gas, and overcomes the barriers among different levels of heterogeneous energy grid systems. This makes it possible to coordinate the vertical complementarity of source-grid-load-storage and the horizontal complementarity of multi-energy while taking into account investment costs and carbon trading to achieve the economic operation of the system. This analysis shows that the proposed model can dissipate the excess of new energy generation from the grid. and achieve a balance between supply and demand, while effectively reducing the economic operation cost of the whole system.
   A cooperative optimization model addresses renewable energy fluctuations, considering carbon constraints and multi-energy complementarity. The model integrates various energy resources, enabling economic operation and balancing supply and demand. It reduces costs by absorbing excess energy, achieving grid stability, and overcoming barriers between different energy grid systems.image

AB In order to solve the problem of new energy consumption and reduce the use of fossil fuels, a multi-objective optimization and evaluation system is constructed for Integrated energy system (IES). The system takes into account factors including economy, environmental conservation, and hydrogen blending ratio. It establishes a mixed-integer linear programming model for multi-objective optimal scheduling. The conversion of renewable energy sources into electricity, followed by its conversion into hydrogen. By changing the hydrogen blending ratio of natural gas pipeline network, each objective function can reach the best. The optimal operation of each equipment of the heat and cold networks is obtained by changing the proportion of hydrogen blending into the natural gas pipeline network. Based on the multi-objective comprehensive analysis under conditions of constant heat consumption, the optimal solution is a hydrogen blending ratio of 10.67 %. This solution results in a cost of $305,426.29, carbon emissions of 19,709,221.40 kg, and a total natural gas consumption of 19,128,759.35 m3. Compared with the conventional energy system, this scheme not only offers better economy but also has characteristics of energy saving and emission reduction, making it superior in comprehensive evaluation compared to other schemes. In conclusion, this system enhances energy utilization efficiency, maximizes the integration of renewable energy sources, and reduces carbon emissions.

AB Worldwide natural gas consumption has increased significantly, especially for power generation in electricity systems with the gas-to-power (G2P) process of natural gas fired units. Supply for both natural gas and electricity systems should be dispatched economically and simultaneously due to their firm interconnection. This paper proposes a security-constrained bi-level economic dispatch (ED) model for integrated natural gas and electricity systems considering wind power and power-to-gas (P2G) process. The upper level is formulated as an ED optimization model for electricity system, while the lower level is an optimal allocation problem for natural gas system. Natural gas system is modeled in detail. In addition, the security constraints and coupling constraints for the integrated energy systems are considered. The objective function is to minimize the total production cost of electricity and natural gas. The lower model is converted and added into the upper model as Karush-Kuhn-Tucher (KKT) optimality conditions, thus the bi-level optimization model is transformed into a mix-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. Numerical case studies on the PJM-5bus system integrated with a seven-node gas system and IEEE 118-bus system integrated with a modified Belgian high-calorific gas system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed bi-level ED model.

AB Integrated energy systems (IESs) are considered a trending solution for the energy crisis and environmental problems. However, the diversity of energy sources and the complexity of the IES have brought challenges to the economic operation of IESs. Aiming at achieving optimal scheduling of components, an IES operation optimization model including photovoltaic, combined heat and power generation system (CHP) and battery energy storage is developed in this paper. The goal of the optimization model is to minimize the operation cost under the system constraints. For the optimization process, an optimization principle is conducted, which achieves maximized utilization of photovoltaic by adjusting the controllable units such as energy storage and gas turbine, as well as taking into account the battery lifetime loss. In addition, an integrated energy system project is taken as a research case to validate the effectiveness of the model via the improved differential evolution algorithm (IDEA). The comparison between IDEA and a traditional differential evolution algorithm shows that IDEA could find the optimal solution faster, owing to the double variation differential strategy. The simulation results in three different battery states which show that the battery lifetime loss is an inevitable factor in the optimization model, and the optimized operation cost in 2016 drastically decreased compared with actual operation data.

AB To tackle the issues of cooperative energy and reserve trading as well as fair cooperative benefit allocation among multiple integrated energy systems (IESs), this paper proposes a two-stage cooperative energy and reserve trading model for multiple integrated energy systems (MIESs). Specifically, at day-ahead stage, MIESs aim to maximize their overall profit through cooperative electricity and heat trading. At real-time stage, MIESs trade demand response (DR) reserve to minimize the overall wind power deviation compensation cost. To reduce the complexity in model solution, we transform the model into two sub-problems. In sub-problem 1, we determine the energy and DR reserve trading volumes. Here, distributionally robust optimization (DRO) is utilized to manage the severe uncertainties in wind power distribution. In sub-problem 2, based on the outcomes from subproblem 1, we settle the energy and DR reserve trading prices. To ensure the fairness of benefit allocation, asymmetric Nash bargaining theory is applied to assess each IES's contributions in trading volumes and profit growth. Interval adaptive alternating direction method of multipliers (IA-ADMM) is used to preserve each IES's privacy. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that, compared with independent operation, cooperative trading among MIESs increases profits for all IESs, thereby motivating their participation in cooperative trading.

AB Hydrogen production using variable renewable energy surplus electricity that called Power-to-Gas is attracting attention as a grid stabilization technology. However, there is an issue that Power-to-Gas is low economically viable to use only for stabilizing of variable renewable energy output. The objective of this article is to evaluate the economic efficiency of the Power-to-Gas system based on the optimal operation strategies by using electricity from both an on-site photovoltaic system and an electric power exchange market, assuming a specific situation in Japan in the near future. The Power-to-Gas plant considered in this article consists of a 1 MW proton exchange membrane electrolyser cell, which has already started demonstration tests, a hydrogen storage tank, and a 3 MW photovoltaic system. An operational planning problem of the plant to optimize the annual hydrogen production schedule is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem, and the economic efficiency is evaluated using the optimized unit price of hydrogen production as an evaluation index. The result shows that the hydrogen unit price is improved by using the power exchange market in addition to on-site photovoltaic due to the improvement of the utilization rate of cell. Case 1 with no constraints of hydrogen storage which has a large impact on hydrogen unit price marks 46.8 JPY/NM3 of the best hydrogen unit price, and Case 2-1, in which a fixed amount of hydrogen is produced continuously and transported by gas piping, improves 5.8 JPY/Nm(3) of the hydrogen unit price compared to Case 2-2, in which batch transportation by a loader. From the sensitivity analysis of varying the depreciation cost of electrolyser cell and the price of the power market, it was concluded that the target unit cost of hydrogen production of less than 30 JPY/Nm(3) can be obtained by decreasing the depreciation cost of the cell by 50% and the price of the market by 30%.(C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Blockchains utilize different consensus mechanisms, among which Proof of Work is one of the more energy and computationally intensive. Chen et al. propose a new mechanism that solves the electricity dispatch problem in grids to establish consensus and demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution in distributed energy system management.
   Traditional centralized optimization and management schemes may be incompatible with a changing energy system whose structure is becoming increasingly distributed. This challenge can hopefully be addressed by blockchain. However, existing blockchains have not been well prepared to integrate mathematical optimization, which plays a key role in many energy system applications. Here we propose a blockchain consensus mechanism tailored to support mathematical optimization problems, called Proof of Solution (PoSo). PoSo mimics Proof of Work (PoW) by replacing the meaningless mathematical puzzle in PoW with a meaningful optimization problem. This is inspired by the fact that both the solutions to the puzzle and to an optimization problem are hard to find but easy to verify. We show the security and necessity of PoSo by using PoSo to enable energy dispatch and trading for two integrated energy systems. The results show that compared with existing optimization schemes, PoSo ensures that only the optimal solution is accepted and executed by participants. Further, compared with existing blockchains, PoSo can seamlessly incorporate mathematical optimization and minimize the workload associated with searching and verifying the optimum.

AB Transforming a coal-fired power generation unit into a so-called integrated energy production unit (IEPU) is considered a promising low-carbon technology. An IEPU produces not only "greener" electricity but also hydrogen and natural gas by capturing carbon emissions from its coal-fired unit. Moreover, an IEPU has an enhanced capacity to adjust its electricity output, i.e., it has better flexibility, and can play a significant role in real-time electricity market (RTM) by trading its flexibility to recover its initial outlay. However, because of the complicated production process and temporal coupling constraint, it is challenging to effectively manage the multi-energy production of IEPU to reach its RTM offering strategy. To solve this problem, this work proposes a novel risk-averse multi-energy management method for effective offering strategy of the IEPU in the RTM. This multi-energy management process comprises three phases. In the first phase, a novel distributionally robust optimal self-scheduling IEPU model is established to determine its desired operating point, which has the best expected profit. This model accurately captures the complicated multi-vector energy production process and leverages the discounted mean entropic value-at-risk to improve the IEPU's ability to withstand risks with an acceptable economic compromise. A novel uncertainty decoupling algorithm is also proposed to improve computational efficiency. In the second phase, an offering strategy making method is proposed to maximize the probability of IEPU winning bids at the desired point. In the third phase, a post-clearing IEPU scheduling method is proposed to ensure that the IEPU operates following the winning bid power. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method enables the IEPU operator to participate in the RTM at its desired operating point at the maximum probability, with properly balanced profit and risk. Additionally, the proposed solution algorithm is verified to significantly accelerate the computation process, thus enhancing the practicality of this multi-energy management method for the RTM participant, who often faces a strict time constraint in decision-making.

AB As the effects of climate change and environmental pollution become more serious, the requirements of low carbon emission are put forward to the operation of integrated energy systems. Under this trend, a cooperative-game-based operation optimization model for integrated energy systems is proposed in this paper. This model can achieve the multi-agent allocation and coordinate the operating costs and carbon emissions. The Anderson-accelerated-based alternating direction multiplication (AA-ADMM) method is used to improve the efficiency of solving the proposed model. Thereafter, the benefit of each agent is allocated by the Shapley value. Results indicate that the proposed model can provide a reasonable trade-off between operating costs and carbon emissions, and the proposed benefit allocation strategy is effective.

AB The current study concentrates on the planning (sitting and sizing) of a renewable integrated energy system that incorporates power-to-hydrogen (P2H) and hydrogen-to-power (H2P) technologies within an active distribution network. This is expressed in the form of an optimization model, in which the objective function is to reduce the annual costs of construction and maintenance of integrated energy systems. The model takes into account the planning and operation model of wind, solar, and bio-waste resources, as well as hydrogen storage (a combination of P2H, H2P, and hydrogen tank), and the optimal power flow constraints of the distribution network. Electrical and hydrogen energy are administered in an integrated energy system. The modeling of the uncertainties regarding the quantity of load and renewable resources is achieved through stochastic optimization using the Unscented Transformation method. The novelties of the scheme include the sizing and placement of a combined hydrogen and power-based renewable integrated energy system, the consideration of the impacts of bio-waste units, P2H, and H2P systems on the planning of the integrated energy system and the operation of the active distribution network, and the modeling of uncertainties using the Unscented Transformation method to reduce the calculation time. The study's results demonstrate the scheme's ability to improve the technical conditions of the distribution network by considering the optimal planning of integrated energy systems. In comparison to the network power flow, the operation status of the network has been improved by approximately 23-45% through the optimal siting, sizing, and energy management of hydrogen storage equipment, as well as renewable resources in the form of integrated energy systems. In other words, optimal energy management and planning of the integrated energy systems in the distribution network has been able to reduce energy losses and voltage drop by 44.5% and 42.4% compared to the load flow studies. In this situation, peak load carrying capability has increased by about 23.7%. In addition, compared to the case of the network with renewable resources, the overvoltage has decreased by about 43.5%. Also, Unscented Transformation method has a lower calculation time than scenario-based stochastic optimization.

AB ABSTR A C T Increasing global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions call for new operation strategies towards low-carbon marine transportation. This paper proposes a coordinated operation strategy for a ship micorgird with hybrid propulsion systems (HPSs) to minimize the whole-voyage operation cost within GHG emission limitations. Hydrogen fuel cells are integrated to the ship microgrid for further reduction of GHG emissions. Purchase costs of fuel, hydrogen and electricity and degradation costs of fuel cells (FCs) and batteries are considered in the calculation of whole-voyage operation cost. The proposed coordinated operation strategy consists of two stages. At the pre-voyage scheduling stage, the amount of purchased fuel, hydrogen and electricity, the power of diesel engines (DEs) and FCs, the charging/discharging states of batteries and the motor/shaft-generator modes of electric machines (EMs) are formulated to minimize the whole-voyage operation cost under the worst case of uncertain propulsion and auxiliary power. At the intra-voyage operation stage, power of batteries and EMs is optimized according to the short-leading-time prediction of propulsion and auxiliary power. Above coordinated operation strategy is formulated as a two-stage robust optimization model and solved by a two-level column-and-constraint-genera-tion (C&CG) algorithm. Numerical simulations based on a practical voyage are carried out to validate the effectiveness of proposed strategy.

AB Rural energy has the characteristics of diversity, dispersion, and regionalism. The construction and operation of its comprehensive energy system are essential for promoting the development of a low-carbon economy in rural areas and reducing carbon emissions. In response, the structure of the rural integrated energy system is initially analyzed and the equipment is planned. Subsequently, the carbon emission in each link of the power generation system is estimated by using the life cycle assessment method. Based on the evaluation results, a suitable low-carbon economy optimal scheduling model is established. The generator set and energy storage equipment in the integrated energy system are designed to enhance the efficiency of energy utilization. Then, the life cycle assessment method is used to calculate the carbon emissions of each stage. Next, the optimal scheduling model is established by taking the minimum carbon emissions and system operating costs as the objective function. In addition, the study introduced a water method and a kinetic accelerator to capture carbon dioxide and feed it into a high-pressure pump for storage. This will enable carbon capture and net zero emissions. The findings revealed that Model 1 exhibited minimal carbon emissions, amounting to 48,530.5 kg, and a comparatively low total operating cost of 30,625.48. After being applied to practical systems, the carbon emissions have been significantly reduced. The research model can effectively guide the low-carbon transformation of rural integrated energy systems and provide important technical support for achieving sustainable development goals in rural areas.

AB This paper investigates Regional Integrated Energy Systems (RIES), emphasizing the connection of diverse energy supply subsystems to address varied user needs and enhance operational efficiency. A novel low-carbon economic dispatch method, utilizing the multi-objective chaotic artificial hummingbird algorithm, is introduced. The method not only optimizes economic and environmental benefits but also aligns with "carbon peak and carbon neutrality" objectives. The study begins by presenting a comprehensive low-carbon economic dispatch model, followed by the proposal of the multi-objective chaotic artificial hummingbird algorithm, crucial for deriving the Pareto frontier of the low-carbon economic dispatch model. Additionally, we introduce a TOPSIS approach based on combined subjective and objective weights, this approach harnesses the objective data from the Pareto solution set deftly, curbs the subjective biases of dispatchers effectively and facilitates the selection of an optimal system operation plan from the Pareto frontier. Finally, the simulation results highlight the outstanding performance of our method in terms of optimization outcomes, convergence efficiency, and solution diversity. Noteworthy among these results is an 8.8% decrease in system operational economic costs and a 14.2% reduction in carbon emissions.

AB Nowadays, integrated energy systems (IESs) have become an influential approach in the backdrop of energy interconnection and low-carbon energy concepts. This paper proposes a multi-energy trading strategy for IESs that simultaneously considers carbon emissions transaction (CET) and tradable green certificate (TGC) to promote low-carbon energy development further. Firstly, a multi-stage robust optimization method addresses uncertainties in renewable energy, loads, and electricity prices to ensure stable operation of the IES. Secondly, a trading mechanism is proposed by integrating CET with TGC to establish a coupled electricity-heat-carbon- green certificate market. Accordingly, a cooperative game framework among multiple IESs is modeled, which considers different contribution allocations while promoting the economic and low-carbon operation of IES. Finally, the model is solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. The proposed strategy's effectiveness in improving the low-carbon economic operation of IESs has been proved through simulation studies.

AB Integrated energy systems (IESs) that combine biogas, solar, and wind energy sources demonstrate considerable potential for effective utilization of renewable energy, which is instrumental for achieving carbon neutrality. The enhancement in their energetic and economic performances relies on optimal design methods that need to consider the combined optimization of capacity and operation and synergy between biogas production, energy conversion, storage, and demand. Therefore, this study proposes a bi-level optimal design method for a biogas-solar-wind IES. First, an exergy hub model is established to accurately describe the variations in the energy quantity and quality resulting from energy conversion processes. Then, the combined capacity and operation optimization problem of the IES is formulated as a bi-level iterative model, and a full-time-series clustering method based on multi-attribute weighting is employed to obtain typical source-load scenarios. The first level is designed to maximize the cost and exergy savings and determine the rated capacities of renewables, energy conversion and storage components; the second level synergistically optimizes the operation schemes of energy conversion, storage, and demand components by incorporating a thermodynamic model of biogas production along with an electrical demand response program. And the iterative optimization mechanisms between these two levels are established. Moreover, a hybrid algorithm combining a genetic algorithm and sequential quadratic programming method is developed to solve the bi-level model. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified through case studies.

AB Transporting green hydrogen by existing natural gas networks has become a practical means to accommodate curtailed wind and solar power. Restricted by pipe materials and pressure levels, there is an upper limit on the hydrogen blending ratio of hydrogen-enriched compressed natural gas (HCNG) that can be transported by natural gas pipelines, which affects whether the natural gas network can supply energy safely and reliably. To this end, this paper investigates the effects of the intermittent and fluctuating green hydrogen produced by different types of renewable energy on the dynamic distribution of hydrogen concentration after it is blended into natural gas pipelines. Based on the isothermal steady-state simulation results of the natural gas network, two convection-diffusion models for the dynamic simulation of hydrogen injections are proposed. Finally, the dynamic changes of hydrogen concentration in the pipelines under scenarios of multiple green hydrogen types and multiple injection nodes are simulated on a seven-node natural gas network. The simulation results indicate that, compared with the solar-power-dominated hydrogen productionblending scenario, the hydrogen concentrations in the natural gas pipelines are more uniformly distributed in the wind-power-dominated scenario and the solar-wind power balance scenario. To be specific, in the solar-power-dominated scenario, the hydrogen concentration exceeds the limit for more time whilst the overall hydrogen production is low, and the local hydrogen concentration in the natural gas network exceeds the limit for nearly 50% of the time in a day. By comparison, in the wind-power-dominated scenario, all pipelines can work under safe conditions. The hydrogen concentration overrun time in the solar-wind power balance scenario is also improved compared with the solar-power-dominated scenario, and the limit-exceeding time of the hydrogen concentration in Pipe 5 and Pipe 6 is reduced to 91.24% and 91.99% of the solar-power-dominated scenario. This work can help verify the day-ahead scheduling strategy of the electricity-HCNG integrated energy system (IES) and provide a reference for the design of local hydrogen production-blending systems.

AB With further aggravation of climate change and energy crisis, more and more attention has been focused on integrated energy systems which can reduce carbon emission and increase accommodation of renewable energy. At present, research on optimal operation of integrated energy systems has been widely carried out. However, intelligent optimization algorithms for solving the optimal operation problems still needs to be further studied. To gap this issue, the slime mould-artificial bee colony (SMABC) algorithm is proposed for the first time to solve optimal operation of the integrated electricity-gas-heating-cooling energy systems which contains renewable energy, power to hydrogen (P2H), power to gas (P2G), hydrogen fuel cells, gas-fueled units, gas boiler, electrical chiller and waste heat recovery units. Additionally, a carbon trading mechanism with the stepped carbon penalty response (SCPR) is presented in the optimal operation model to cut down operation cost as well as to reduce carbon emission considering power load, gas load, heating load and cooling load. Further, four case studies were carried out on an integrated energy systems using the proposed SMABC algorithm. The results illustrate that SMABC algorithm has great advantages than the traditional particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the slime mould (SM) algorithm in terms of better economic/environmental benefit (7.58 % and 2.82 % decline in operation cost as well as 21.02 % and 12.19 % reduction in carbon emission, respectively). Meanwhile, renewable energy curtailment is reduced significantly using SMABC algorithm than using PSO algorithm and SM algorithm (decreased by 77.27 % and 63.43 %, respectively). Moreover, the SCPR contributes to less carbon emission (reduced by 21.93 %). The presented optimal operation model considering carbon trading mechanism with SCPR as well as the proposed SMABC algorithm are respected to be applied to other integrated energy systems.

AB Due to the advantages of reliability and economy, multiple adjacent region integrated energy systems (IESs) are interconnected to form a multi-region IES through multi-energy network. However, the limitation on private data exchange, multi-uncertainty and the complex dynamic characteristics bring challenges to the optimal scheduling of the multi-region IES. This paper proposes a distributed robust cooperative scheduling method for the multi-region electricity-natural gas-heat IES considering the dynamic characteristics and the uncertainties of wind turbine (WT) and electricity load. Firstly, a robust scheduling model of the multi-region IES considering dynamic characteristics and the uncertainties is built. In particular, the dynamic transmission models of gas and heating networks are constructed, and a regulation model of virtual heat storage is built to control the virtual heat storage in district heating network (DHN). Further, to preserve the information privacy and decision-making independence for each sub-region IES, a distributed cooperative scheduling framework based on the consensus-based alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed for the multi -region IES, where the original robust scheduling model is decomposed into several subproblems that are solved independently. Moreover, the nonconvex dynamic natural gas flow function is addressed by convex relaxation technique, and the max-min robust model with binary variables is solved by alternative optimization procedure (AOP) method and duality theory. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed method can converge reliably, realize the balance between the operation cost and the heat loss and provide a flexible scheduling scheme for the multi-region IES.

AB This study addresses the use of former gas storage facilities as short-term storage for renewable energy through power-to-gas (PtG) technology in Germany. Three test cases with coupled thermal-hydromechanical (THM) modelling were conducted to evaluate short-term injection and production schedules. The operating rates were controlled by the upper and lower limits of the wellbore pressure. The maximum difference in pore pressure and effective stress was 0.6 MPa in all cases. Fault reactivation analysis was performed on the THM models to estimate fault stability. The critical pore pressure for safe reservoir operation was determined to be 1.25 times the original pore pressure, corresponding to a WBHP value of 20.25 MPa. The upper limit of the gas injection rate for safe storage operation was estimated to be between 100,000 and 150,000 m(3)/day. The thermal stresses were found to be negligible for short-term cases. The storage capacity of PtG technology was reported to be up to 1,322,400 kWh/d of renewable electricity, which can contribute to Germany becoming a greenhouse gas neutral country by 2050. The workflows and results of the study are applicable to all gas storage in a porous medium, including methane, CO2, and hydrogen.

AB To enhance low-carbon economies within Park Integrated Energy Systems (PIES) while addressing the variability of wind power generation, an innovative optimization scheduling strategy is proposed, incorporating a reward-and-punishment ladder carbon trading mechanism. This method effectively mitigates the unpredictability of wind power output and integrates Power-to-Gas (P2G), Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), and Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems. This study develops a CHP model that combines P2G and CCS, focusing on electric-heat coupling characteristics and establishing constraints on P2G capacity, thereby significantly enhancing electric energy flexibility and reducing carbon emissions. The carbon allowance trading strategy is refined through the integration of reward and punishment coefficients, yielding a more effective trading model. To accurately capture wind power uncertainty, the research employs kernel density estimation and Copula theory to create a representative sequence of daily wind and photovoltaic power scenarios. The Dung Beetle Optimization (DBO) algorithm, augmented by Non-Dominated Sorting (NSDBO), is utilized to solve the resulting multi-objective model. Simulation results indicate that the proposed strategy increases the utilization rates of renewable energy in PIES by 28.86% and 19.85%, while achieving a reduction in total carbon emissions by 77.65% and a decrease in overall costs by 36.91%.

AB Faced with the problem of fossil energy depletion and the power industry's low-carbon requirements, low-carbon technologies in collaboration with market mechanisms, supplemented by flexible resources, are critical to achieving the low-carbon operation of integrated energy systems (IES). This paper establishes an IES considering multiple types of low-carbon factors and demand response. Firstly, the IES is deemed to participate in the carbon trading market and introduce a ladder-type carbon trading mechanism at the low-carbon policy level. Then, at the low-carbon technology level, carbon capture power plants and power-to-gas equipment are introduced to refine the modeling of the power-to-gas process. Secondly, the integrated energy system includes pluralistic energy storage technology and demand response to increase the IES's flexibility. Based on multiple types of low carbon factors and demand response mechanisms, the scheduling model for energy efficiency improvement is constructed with the lowest sum of the cost of wind abandonment penalty, the cost of purchasing energy, the cost of equipment operation and maintenance, and the cost of carbon trading as the optimization objective, and solved by a two-stage optimization method. Five energy efficiency indicators are presented to efficiently evaluate dispatching results: wind power consumption rate, carbon trading cost, actual carbon emissions, total cost, and load fluctuation. Finally, according to an arithmetic test system based on various operation scenarios, the proposed model may increase the IES's comprehensive energy efficiency under the coupling effect of multiple types of low-carbon factors and demand response.

AB Integrated energy systems can provide a more efficient supply than individual systems by using resources such as cogeneration. To foster efficient management of these systems, the flexible operation of cogeneration resources should be considered for the generation expansion planning model to satisfy the varying demand of energy including heat and electricity, which are interdependent and present different seasonal characteristics. We propose an optimization model of the generation expansion planning for an integrated energy system considering the feasible operation region and efficiency of a combined heat and power (CHP) resource. The proposed model is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem to minimize the sum of the annualized cost of the integrated energy system. Then, we set linear constraints of energy resources and describe linearized constraints of a feasible operation region and a generation efficiency of the CHP resource for application to the problem. The effectiveness of the proposed optimization problem is verified through a case study comparing with results of a conventional optimization model that uses constant heat-to-power ratio and generation efficiency of the CHP resource. Furthermore, we evaluate planning schedules and total generation efficiency profiles of the CHP resource for the compared optimization models.

AB Exergy analysis provides a unified scale for evaluating the quality and quantity of energy, and is suitable and essential for scientifically and rationally guiding the optimization and evaluation of integrated energy systems with intricate multi-component configurations. The present work proposes an exergy analysis model and joint solution framework for integrated energy systems based on exergy, and presents an efficient and accurate solution method. The exergy analysis model is analogous to the energy-based model and possesses a succinct form. This model is then applied to establish an input exergy model defining the exergy of inputs, a destroyed exergy model defining the exergy lost due to the conversions, transmissions, and storages, and a benefit exergy model defining the remaining useful exergy for the loads. The joint solution framework optimizes the system from the basis of exergy conservation, and evaluates the destroyed exergy of each link and the prices of the various exergy products from an economic perspective based on the established exergy analysis model. The complexity of the framework is then reduced by establishing a sequential optimization and evaluation model. The optimization model is solved accurately and efficiently using a stringent cutting plane method to address the problem of relaxation inaccuracy, and piecewise linearization to accommodate the non-convex constraints. Numerical computations on a 97-node system demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed models in exergy-based optimization, destruction, and price evaluation, preventing substantial deviations (e.g., a 23% discrepancy in total destroyed exergy). The adopted cost allocation method based on energy quality reflects fair pricing, rectifying conventional pricing disparities (e.g., a 47.56% underestimation of the electric load using energy-based pricing). Therefore, the accuracy and efficiency of the developed exergy analysis model, solution framework, and solution method are validated.

AB DC microgrid (DC mu G) is becoming popular for niche applications due to multiple advantages over AC microgrids (mu G). However, operation of a DC mu G is challenging due to uncertainties of renewable energy source (RES) generation and load demands, limited availability of controllable generation, and unintended islanding events. Sectoral coupling between electricity and hydrogen (H2), 2 ), hybrid energy storage system (HESS), and demand response (DR) implementation address the challenges and enhance the techno-economic benefits of DC mu G operation. Further, incorporating islanding constraints in the scheduling strategy improves the security of system operation. The objective of this paper is to develop an energy management scheme (EMS) for an electricity-H2 2 grid-connected DC mu G with a HESS incorporating islanding constraints and DR implementation in an uncertain environment with correlated and uncorrelated input uncertainties to maximize the profit of the DC mu G operator (DC mu GO), minimize the electricity usage cost of consumers, and ensure secure operation after unintended islanding using bi-level optimization.DC mu G network level, equipment level, and consumer's apparatus level operating security constraints are considered in the EMS. Uncertainties of input random variables (RV) and their correlation are modelled using Copula theory and incorporated in the EMS. The DC mu G consists of a gas turbine (GT), power to hydrogen (P2H), hydrogen to power (H2P), HESS (comprising battery energy storage system (BESS) and hydrogen storage system (HSS)), wind power generation (WPG), solar power generation (SPG), and consumers. The consumers have non-flexible and flexible loads (thermostatically controlled load (TCL) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV)). The proposed EMS is modelled using a bilevel leader-follower Stackelberg game (SG) architecture, in which the DC mu GO is the leader and the consumers are followers. The DC mu GO optimally schedules flexible resources within its control and sets the retail power price (RPP) to maximize the operating profit. Consumers participate in the DR program by adjusting flexible demands according to the RPP to minimize the cost of electricity use. The dynamic RPP acts as the bridge between the upper and lower-level problems. The bi-level EMS is reformulated as a single-level mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem by successively using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, the big- M method, and the strong duality theory. The MILP problem is solved in the MATLAB environment with the YALMIP toolbox and GUROBI solver. Simulation studies reveal that the proposed approach balances the interests of the DC mu GO and the consumers, ensures secure operation after unintended islanding, reduces RES curtailment, reduces the electricity usage cost of the consumers, and enhances the profit of the DC mu GO. For the system under study, the profit of the DC mu GO increases by similar to 2.22% . 22% while the cost of energy use of the flexible consumers is reduced by similar to 18.05%. . 05%.

AB Integrated energy systems can effectively improve the efficiency of energy utilization and promote sustainable development of energy, while meeting the diversified energy demands. In order to deal with the operation risk caused by system uncertainties, the CVaR method was introduced into the system optimization model for risk management. The CVaR model was adopted to solve a multi-objective optimization problem using a two-stage stochastic programming method, where the uncertainty about solar energy and energy demand are considered at the same time. By comparing the optimization results obtained from the CVaR method and from the conventional scenario-based stochastic programming method, the effectiveness of the CVaR method in risk management of integrated energy systems is verified.

DE Autonomous hydrogen power complex; Nuclear power plant; Own needs
   reservation; Economic analysis; Inflation; Forecasting
AB Currently, the United Energy System (UEC) of Russia is trending in the deficit of peak and half-peak capacity with a simultaneous increase in the number of nuclear power plants (NPPs), which will require the participation of the NPPs in the variable part of the schedule of electrical loads.
   In addition to the economic need to maintain the high-level utilization rate, there are technological limitations of maneuverability for NPPs.
   The authors developed an approach to solving this problem by combining with an environmentally friendly energy source - an autonomous hydrogen power complex, which includes thermal batteries and an additional multifunctional low-power steam turbine installation.
   The feasibility study of the main equipment of the autonomous hydrogen power complex, which is necessary for combining with a two-unit nuclear power plant with WWER-1000, has been evaluated.
   On the basis of the assessment of the inflation indicators of the Russian economy over the past 11 years, three variants of fuel cost dynamics and tariff rates for electricity (capacity) as well as the size of operating costs, including depreciation deductions to the main equipment, are defined, taking into account the current principles of price formation.
   The result is a value for accumulated net present value, depending on the ratio of the cost of the half-peak and off-peak electricity at different inflation rates.
   The positive economic effect of reducing the risk of the core damage accident, replacing the construction of the gas turbine unit as a maneuverable source of electricity in the power grid and increasing the income of the Russian federal budget from the savings of natural gas has been taken into account.
   The greatest economic efficiency is achieved with maximum projected inflation, which is associated with the maximum rate of discounting and the high rate of growth of electricity tariffs.
   Reducing the risk of the core damage accident ensures that the proposed approach is competitive in all the inflation options under consideration and the ratio of electricity tariffs. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

ID FREQUENCY REGULATION
AB Community integrated energy systems (CIES) have become flexible contributors to DR within distribution networks. Buildings' thermal capacities can serve as virtual energy storage (VES) to augment CIES flexibility. However, uncertainties in environmental factors and building parameters hinder the accurate use of virtual energy storage without compromising user comfort. In addition, a single type of flexible resource is usually insufficient to meet the complex DR requirements of distribution system operators, underscoring the need for coordinating physical and virtual energy storage. This study proposes a hybrid data -driven operational approach to enhance the DR of a CIES. Real-time measurements were employed instead of exact system models and parameters to effectively dispatch VES during DR events. Additionally, rolling robust optimization was implemented to coordinate physical and virtual energy storage for DR, accommodating various uncertainties and multi-timescale characteristics within the CIES. Through its application to a case study, the proposed method demonstrated its efficacy in leveraging VES in a CIES for DR without compromising users' thermal comfort. In a typical power reduction scenario, the DR revenue increased by 39.6%, while the overall operational cost decreased by 17.0%. In the power increase scenario, the DR revenue increased by 122.0%, and the overall operational cost decreased by 20.0%.

AB Nowadays, ever-increasing energy demands and the depletion of fossil fuels require efficient and environmentally friendly technologies for energy generation. In this context, energy systems integration makes for a very strong proposition since it results in energy saving, fuel diversification, and the supply of cleaner energy. To this end, it is of the utmost importance to realize the current developments in this field and portray the state of the art of renewable generation in integrated energy systems. This review evaluates the utilization of bioenergy in cogeneration and trigeneration systems. The statistical reports of bioenergy and combined heat and power deployments in 28 countries of the European Union are discussed. Then, the most common research objectives of biomass-fueled combined heat and power systems are classified into three primary performance analyses, namely, energy and exergy analysis, thermo-economic optimization, and environment assessment. The influencing parameters of biomass utilization on each type of assessment are discussed, and the basic principles for carrying out such analyses in energy systems are explained. It is illustrated that the properties of feedstock, selection of appropriate conversion technology, associated costs with the biomass-to-bioenergy process, and sustainability of biomass are the primary influencing factors that could significantly affect the results of each assessment.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB The integrated energy system is a complex energy system that involves multi-stakeholder and multi-energy coordinated operations. The key to improving its scale and sustainable development is to construct a better-integrated energy system dispatching method which is suitable for the power market. However, the randomness of the supply side and load side of the integrated energy system brings further challenges to system planning and scheduling. Therefore, the optimal scheduling method of an integrated energy system considering the uncertainty of supply and demand in the market environment is studied in this paper. Firstly, the uncertainty models of the supply side and load side of the integrated energy system are established. Then, the optimal scheduling model based on robust chance constraint is established. The reserve capacity constraint is set as a chance constraint with a certain confidence level to maximize the system profit in the power market. Finally, simulations show that the proposed method not only guarantees the robustness of the system but also improves the economy of the system. The method provides ideas for exploring the development mechanism and strategy of integrated energy systems in the electricity market environment.

AB This study addresses the energy management of an integrated solar-hydrogen microgrid. The microgrid includes zero-emission vehicles, renewable energy sources, an electrolyzer, bidirectional charging stations, and a hydrogen refueling station with hydrogen storage. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charging stations can alleviate renewable electricity variability by discharging the energy of vehicle batteries back to the grid. The electrolyzer can absorb excess solar generation to balance supply and demand with power-to-gas (P2G) trans-actions. Given the uncertainties from intermittent renewable generation and energy de-mand, a two-stage stochastic optimization framework derives the optimal power management strategy for the component subsystems, aiming to minimize operating costs. The first stage of the model determines the day-ahead charging price and power supply for electric vehicle charging and hydrogen production, and the second stage performs real-time energy scheduling under different scenarios. The performance of the proposed opti-mization strategy is examined through a case study using real-world data, and the results demonstrate that daily operating costs can be reduced by up to 27.5%. Moreover, inclusion of the P2G process with hydrogen storage yields better performance to support peak shaving and reducing costs compared to using V2G or dynamic pricing-based demand response policies only.

AB In response to the imperative of achieving net-zero emissions, Multi-Energy Microgrids (MEMGs) have emerged as pivotal infrastructures. This study advocates for precise scheduling of integrated energy resources within MEMGs, incorporating energy conversion facilities and optimizing a hybrid Demand Response (DR) scheme. The integration of hydrogen-based technologies, such as hydrogen power transmission units, hydrogen storage systems (HSSs), fuel cells, and battery electric vehicles (BEVs), offers unprecedented opportunities to mitigate carbon emissions effectively. The approach leverages a novel multi-objective optimization method, the Horse Herd Optimization Algorithm (HOA), complemented by fuzzy sampling and Pareto criteria, to address complex objectives including minimizing operational costs and emissions. The developed energy management model facilitates continuous control mechanisms for MEMG operators, accommodating both flexible and inflexible energy demands. Importantly, the study navigates uncertainties in electricity market prices, energy demand, and renewable power generation through robust stochastic modeling and multiple probabilistic scenarios. This study achieves a significant 18% reduction in operational costs and a remarkable 25% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, leveraging advanced technologies like HSSs, fuel cells, and BEVs within MEMGs. The integration of these technologies also enables up to 15% improvement in energy efficiency and a 12% increase in revenue generation through optimized energy trading strategies.

AB With the economic development, the clean and low-carbon integrated energy system is of great sig-nificance to the social sustainable development in the world. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel energy supply efficiency evaluation model of integrated energy systems based on slacks-based measure data envelopment analysis (SBM-DEA) integrating Monte Carlo for energy saving and optimization. The extended energy supply data of integrated energy systems based on the Monte Carlo is verified in terms of F test. Then cooling load, heating load, electric load and internal combustion engine load are taken as inputs. And cooling income, heating income and electricity sales are set as desired outputs and the carbon tax is set as the undesired output to build the energy supply efficiency evaluation model of in-tegrated energy systems using the SBM-DEA for energy optimization and carbon tax reduction. The results show that the proposed method has a high degree of discrimination to obtain better effective decision-making units (DMUs). Moreover, energy optimization and carbon tax reduction of integrated energy systems are achieved. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Community integrated energy system; Reliability-constrained planning;

ID MILP MODEL
AB Reliability is a prerequisite for community integrated energy systems to provide consumers with uninterrupted high-quality energy supply. However, it is still challenging to consider reliability in the planning of community integrated energy systems due to the complexity of energy conversion relationships. Conventional reliability-constrained planning methods usually form a bi-level optimization problem in which the planning scheme optimization and reliability index calculation are separated into two subproblems. In this paper, a novel reliability-constrained planning method for community integrated energy systems is proposed. First, the fault incidence matrices are employed to construct the analytic reliability evaluation model of community integrated energy system. Then, the reliability evaluation model is linearized and explicitly integrated into the planning model, forming a mixed-integer linear programming model. This model can be efficiently solved by mathematical optimization algorithms while effectively balancing the operation cost and reliability at the planning stage. Case studies are conducted based on a practical community integrated energy system in North China to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Building energy consumption is the main urban energy consumption component, which mainly serves people-centered work and living energy demands. Based on the physical requirements of humans in urban buildings and to determine the comfortable body temperature in each season, this paper establishes a sizing optimization model of building-type integrated energy systems (IES) for sustainable development, where the cooling and heating loads required to maintain indoor somatosensory body comfort temperature are calculated. Depending on the external energy price, internal power balance, and other constraints, the model develops an optimal sizing and capacity-planning method of energy conversion and storage unit in a building-type IES with PV generation. The operating principle is described as follows: the PV generation is fully consumed, a gas engine satisfies the electric and thermal base load requirements, and the power system and a heat pump supply the remaining loads. The gas price, peak-valley electricity price gap, and heat-to-power ratio of gas engines are considered important factors for the overall techno-economic analysis. The developed method is applied to optimize the economic performance of building-type IES and verified by practical examples. The results show that using the complementary characteristics of different energy conversion units is important to the overall IES cost. A 300 kW building photovoltaic system can reduce the gas engine capacity from 936.7 kW to 854.7 kW, and the annual cost can be approximately reduced from 7.82 million to 7.50 million RMB yuan.

In this paper, an electrothermal hybrid energy storage model based on electricity, hydrogen and thermal energy conversion and storage is introduced, and a microgrid autonomous operational strategy is proposed. First, the addition of the power to hydrogen transfer equipment in the traditional combined heat and power (TCHP) system without battery energy storage is studied, and a micro gas turbine, electric to hydrogen transfer equipment and electric boiler based electrothermal energy storage system (ETSS) model is established Aiming at the lowest comprehensive operating cost of multiple energy sources in a microgrid and maximizing the consumption of curtailed wind, the multi-objective scheduling model of an electrothermal hybrid energy storage system is established, then the multi-energy autonomous operational strategy of a microgrid is proposed. Lastly, the simulation of a multi-energy microgrid in Northeast China is taken as an example. The results of the simulation showed that compared with a combined heat and power microgrid system considering conventiona battery energy storage, a multi-energy microgrid system using electrothermal hybrid energy storage has better flexibility and economy, and can improve wind power accommodation.

AB Against the background of the "30 x 60" target, low-carbon policies and technologies have become the new starting point and destination of energy conservation and emission reduction in energy systems. Power-to-Gas (P2G), as a new energy conversion mode, provides a new way of consuming energy and reducing carbon emissions. An optimal dispatching model of a park-level integrated energy system considering flexible load and power-to-gas (P2G) participation in the carbon trading market is proposed. Firstly, a comprehensive demand response model for electricity and heat is established according to the system's flexible load characteristics, adding power-to gas equipment and a combined heat and power (CHP) unit to the system. Secondly, against the background of the carbon trading mechanism and considering the incentive effect of P2G on the carbon trading mechanism, a systematic comprehensive carbon trading cost model is established. Finally, the operation objectives of the low-carbon economy, with minimum energy purchase costs, carbon emission costs, and operating costs, are constructed using a CPLEX commercial solver. The results verify the importance of considering the operational cost of P2G and the feasibility of considering both operating economy and wind power accommodation ability together in integrated energy systems.

AB This paper proposes a security and economic integration scheduling of electricity-heat integrated energy systems (IES) in order to address the uncertainty from the renewable energy source (RES) and load demand and ensure voltage safety. Firstly, we develop mathematical models for the electricity-heat IES using mathematical techniques. Additionally, we predict the power output of the RES and load demand using back propagation (BP) neural networks with genetic optimization. Secondly, we establish an objective function that includes voltage safety and total operating cost. This objective function takes into account the constraints of the electric and heat networks, as well as individual devices. We solve this problem using simulated annealing particle swarms optimization (SA-PSO), which shows superior performance in comparison to other methods. Finally, we carry out comparative simulation schemes to validate the proposed security and economic integration scheduling, which improves the overall operational efficiency and ensures system voltage safety at the same time.

AB Uncertain load behavior affects the energy system operation scheduling in battery-integrated energy systems (BIES) due to the direct relation between optimal battery scheduling and load demand in the forthcoming time interval. In this paper, the optimal schedule of BIES is investigated with considering load demand uncertainty. The previous works have introduced a cost function and found optimal strategies using evolutionary optimization algorithms, which may fall in local minima. Against the previous works and in order to avoid falling in local minima, a closed-form expression is presented in this paper by analyzing a mathematically-modeled forecast error and considering battery characteristics. In the proposed method, the optimal battery charging/discharging state is analytically obtained based on forecast error and system parameters without the need to use numerical approximation algorithms. The applicability of the proposed scheduling strategy in the real energy system is shown by applying it to online optimal control of the battery in a real system with load demand forecast error, and also by comparing the results with previous methods. The proposed approach leads to the globally-optimal solution for battery scheduling and also shrinks the computational complexity of the BIES scheduling problem. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB High intermittence of renewable energy resources (RESs) and restriction for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have significantly challenged the operations of traditional diesel generator (DG) based microgirds. This paper considers an emission-free microgid with hybrid hydrogen-battery energy storage (HHBES) and proposes a coordinated operational strategy to minimize its daily operation costs. In addition to the electricity purchase costs in the day-ahead market and the operational costs of RESs, the total degradation cost of HHBES is also included in the cost calculation. The proposed operational strategy consists of two coordinated stages. At the day-ahead stage, the schedule for the tie-line power is exchanged with the main grid, the output power of the fuel cell (FC) and the input power of the electrolysis device (ED) are optimized under the worst case of uncertain power output from RESs and power demand from electricity loads (ELs). At the intra-day stage, the battery power is determined according to the short-term prediction for the power of RESs and ELs. The problem is formulated as a robust optimization model and solved by a two-level column-and-constraint-generation (C&CG) algorithm. Numerical simulations using Australian energy market operator (AEMO) data are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

AB Based on the real-time environmental constraints in urban regional construction, this paper constructed a bi-level decentralized low-carbon optimal dispatching model of the urban regional integrated energy system (RIES), including the park integrated energy systems (IESs). In this model, a bi-level optimal allocation model of carbon emission constraints between the urban and the park is proposed for the first time. The upper urban will formulate the real-time carbon emission constraints based on real-time environmental monitoring, decomposing the historical carbon emissions to the lower park IESs; the lower park will meet the real-time carbon emission constraints during optimization. We through the upper urban with the lower park between the bi-level decentralized optimization to ensure that the objective function's upper urban power, natural gas, and heat distribution network system is minimum total network loss. In addition, it is necessary to ensure the minimum operating cost of each park IESs and focus on how to meet the requirements of the overall environment of urban RIES. Furthermore, we study the influence of optimal allocation strategy of carbon emission constraints on network loss, and operating cost of urban RIES under different scenarios. Then, an improved analytical target cascading (ATC) method is applied to solve the bi-level decentralized optimal dispatching model of urban RIES. Finally, an example under three different scenarios is given to verify the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed model and the improved method.

AB This paper proposes stochastic programming to optimal economic scheduling problems of a sustainable integrated energy system with renewable resources including power, natural gas, and hydrogen carriers. Hydrogen is considered a byproduct of electrical power and natural gas carriers using water electrolysis and steam methane reform process technologies. The main objective is to minimize the operation and emission costs while addressing uncertainties of electric/heating/cooling demands, electricity price, and renewable generation using scenario-based stochastic programming. To achieve a risk-hedging strategy, downside risk constraints are involved to minimize the risky scenarios portfolio. The whole problem is modeled as mixed-integer linear programming in GAMS optimization software. The analysis revealed that the expected operation cost without DRC is $ 577.52 and the expected risk-in-cost value for risky scenarios is $ 470.7. However, a conservative decision for reaching zero risk is costly and increases the expected cost up to $ 2901.1, which is not economically viable. A modest decision-making strategy compromises the cost and risk values where for decreasing the risk-in-cost to $ 288.7 (36.8%), the expected cost increased by to $1010.39 (75.95%). Moreover, the risk-averse decision-maker lowers the power sold to the grid, increases the use of water electrolyzing instead of the SMR process to reduce the environmental charges, and tries to increase flexibility with the help of hydrogen and battery storage.

AB Integrated energy systems have recently attracted interest for the purpose of energy development and utilization owing to the increase in environmental pollution and the shortage of fossil energy. However, the integration of a high proportion of renewable energies and controllable loads in the system increases the uncertainty of system operation significantly. In order to rapidly track the system fluctuations and accurately control the operating equipment, a bi-level and multi-timescale dispatch and control strategy based on model predictive control is proposed for a community integrated energy system (CIES) considering dynamic response performance. The upper-level optimizer completes the rolling forecast of renewable outputs and loads over a long-time horizon, and builds an economic rolling optimal scheduling model with consideration of feedback correction. The lower-level controller establishes a closed-loop dynamic performance optimization control model over a short time scale by real-time controlling the system's upstream energy equipment. The simulation results on a modified CIES located in Beijing, China demonstrate that the proposed bi-level strategy increases the prediction accuracy while ensuring the economic efficiency of the system operation, and improves the dynamic tracking ability of the equipment and the overall energy supply dynamic response rate of the system, which provides a fundamental way for efficient application of CIES.

AB The deployment of diverse energy storage technologies, with the combination of daily, weekly and seasonal storage dynamics, allows for the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per unit energy provided. In particular, the production, storage and re-utilization of hydrogen starting from renewable energy has proven to be one of the most promising solutions for offsetting seasonal mismatch between energy generation and consumption. A realistic possibility for large-scale hydrogen storage, suitable for long-term storage dynamics, is presented by salt caverns. In this contribution, we provide a framework for modeling underground hydrogen storage, with a focus on salt caverns, and we evaluate its potential for reducing the CO2 emissions within an integrated energy systems context. To this end, we develop a first-principle model, which accounts for the transport phenomena within the rock and describes the dynamics of the stored energy when injecting and withdrawing hydrogen. Then, we derive a linear reduced order model that can be used for mixed-integer linear program optimization while retaining an accurate description of the storage dynamics under a variety of operating conditions. Using this new framework, we determine the minimum-emissions design and operation of a multi-energy system with H-2 storage. Ultimately, we assess the potential of hydrogen storage for reducing CO2 emissions when different capacities for renewable energy production and energy storage are available, mapping emissions regions on a plane defined by storage capacity and renewable generation. We extend the analysis for solar- and wind-based energy generation and for different energy demands, representing typical profiles of electrical and thermal demands, and different CO2 emissions associated with the electric grid.

AB The collaborative optimization dispatching of multiple energy flows plays a crucial role in achieving the economic and efficient low-carbon operation of integrated energy systems (IESs). However, the dispatching problem for IESs is characterized by high dimensionality, non-linearity, and complex coupling. Furthermore, the integration of renewable energy sources and flexible loads has transformed the IES into a complex dynamic system with significant uncertainty. Traditional intelligent optimization algorithms exhibit poor adaptability and lengthy solution computation time when tackling such problems. In contrast, deep reinforcement learning (DRL), as an interactive trial-and-error learning method, has shown improved decision-making capabilities. In view of this, a data-driven soft actor-critic (SAC) deep reinforcement learning-based approach is proposed in this paper for interval optimal dispatch of IESs considering multiple uncertainties. First, the basic principle of SAC rein-forcement learning is introduced in detail, and the basic framework of reinforcement learning for interval optimal scheduling of IESs is constructed. Then, the environment model of agent interaction is constructed, and the action and state space of DRL, as well as the reward mechanism and neural network structure, are designed. Finally, a typical IES case is experimentally analyzed and compared with three popular DRL algorithms and five state-of-the-art intelligent optimization algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed method in solving the optimal dispatching of IESs.

AB As one of the important approaches to take complementary advantages of heat and electricity, an integrated energy system with combined heat and power (CHP) units enables the coupling of electricity and heating net-works, which markedly increases energy utilization efficiency. However, the different characteristics between heat and electricity bring a great challenge to realizing synergy and complementarity. In this paper, a ther-mal-hydraulic model is developed based on the analogy between heating and electricity networks to analyze the district heating network. Thereafter, a new electricity-heat coupling model with matrix formulation, also known as the coupled power flow model, is proposed to realize the combined calculation of heat and electricity in an integrated energy system. The thermal-hydraulic model is validated by simulation results obtained from Advanced Process Simulation Software (APROS) with relatively small errors. The validated coupled power flow model is further applied to conduct an optimization study to evaluate the integrated energy system efficiency considering wind power and heat storage. Optimization results show that the simultaneous addition of an electric boiler and a heat storage unit can reduce the total operating cost by 17.36%. The present study indicates that coupling calculation of heat and electricity can be achieved with the proposed power flow model, which is beneficial to the design and optimization of practical integrated energy systems.

AB At present, the safe operation of integrated energy systems is significantly affected by the considerable uncertainty inherent to wind and photovoltaic power generation. Based on this, this paper proposes an optimal scheduling model for integrated electricity, heat, and hydrogen-based energy systems on distributed robust optimization (DRO). Firstly, a combined heat and power microgrid system considering hydrogen energy systems was constructed based on the thermoelectric cogeneration characteristics of fuel cells and electrolyzers. Then, a data-driven two-stage distribution robust optimization scheduling model is built by combining typical historical data of wind power output, photovoltaic power output, and load. The results show that the distributed robust method reduces the running cost by 6% compared to the deterministic method. The proposed method and model are capable of meeting the demand for thermoelectric loads within the microgrid in a more cost-effective manner, thereby achieving stable and independent operation of the system.

AB Problems related to the uncertainties of the sources and loads in integrated energy systems (IESs) are becoming more prominent with the interconnection of large-scale renewable energy sources and multi-energy loads. Moreover, such scenarios pose great challenges for the optimal operation of IESs. A distributed IES in an industrial park is regarded as the research object, and a stochastic optimal operation model based on multiple-scenario simulations is proposed to consider the prediction uncertainties arising in the case of distributed power generation and multi-energy loads. Specifically, scenario analysis for stochastic optimization is applied to address these prediction uncertainties in a two-part approach: operation scenario generation based on Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and the reduction of multiple scenarios into a smaller number of more general scenarios based on K-means. Afterwards, a day-ahead stochastic optimal operation model for a distributed IES with the total operating economy as the decision-making objective is proposed based on typical operation scenarios. Moreover, the overall energy efficiency and new energy consumption capacity are all considered. In this way, the safe and economical operation of the IES can be guaranteed even under the negative influence of uncertainties. The validity and rationality of the proposed model are verified by analysis of examples. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a model for the optimal operation of Micro-Grids (MGs) based on multi-agent systems. The studied MG including Micro-Turbine (MT) with Fuel Cell (FC) as the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) unit, Rubbish Incinerator (RI), Wind Turbine (WT), boiler, reformer, anaerobic digestion, as well as the electrical, thermal, and hydrogen storage units to supply both electrical and thermal loads. Also, the input fuels of MT and FC are natural gas and hydrogen, respectively. The wet waste has been used to supply hydrogen requirements for FC operation by anaerobic digestion and reformer. Also, municipal solid waste, which is separated from wet waste, is used in the RI unit to produce electrical energy. Hence, the MG also has power exchange with the upstream network. The proposed model schedules not only the output day-ahead electric power of units but also the exchanged power with the upstream network, to reduce the operation cost. For better evaluation of the problem, the uncertainties of WT, loads, and electricity price are considered and modeled by using probability distribution functions and Monte Carlo simulation. According to electrical load including vital and responsive loads, the Demand Response (DR) program has been considered in the MG operation. The simulation results show that the proposed model for the optimal operation of MG could minimize the operating cost by about 30%, under different conditions.

AB Over the past few years, much attention has been paid to hydrogen energy. The development of hydrogen technologies leads to a reduction in the cost of both the hydrogen fuel itself and hydrogen systems, which leads to a wider use of this type of fuel in various branches of the fuel and energy complex.At the moment, the primary task is to increase the efficiency of combined cycle power units, reduce wear and tear of equipment during peak electricity consumption, reliable backup of energy supply, and reduce harmful emissions during the generation of heat and electricity. One of the modern methods for implementing these challenges is the use of energy storage devices. A new solution to this problem can be the introduction of hydrogen storage in the cycle of a thermal power plant.The article considers the modernization of a combined-cycle power unit with a gas turbine PG6111FA manufactured by << General Electric >> with a rated power of 80 MW, a waste heat steam boiler manufactured by JSC << EnergoMashinostroitelny Alliance >>, and a steam turbine KT-33/36-7.5/0.12. During periods of night unloading, the effective efficiency of the power unit drops, so it is necessary not to unload the equipment, but to turn on the electrolyzers for the production of hydrogen fuel for further use in hydrogen fuel cells. The operating time of the hydrogen system with an electrolyzer is not limited in time, the operation of the electrolyzer takes place during night unloading periods (from 4 to 7 h a day), while the hydrogen storage works constantly, in this mode of operation, the service life is about 15 years, for stable operation it is necessary hydrogen fuel and periodic maintenance. An important component of the hydrogen system is a hydrogen battery with minimal storage losses, in contrast to traditionally installed thermal storage. Studies of the use of hydrogen storage in the circuits of thermal power plants have shown their effectiveness, including their implementation allows you to increase the efficiency, reduce the cost of own needs of the power plant, reduce emissions in the production of electricity, a leveled load schedule allows you to increase the life of the gas turbine, as the turbine works in basic mode. The use of accumulators in thermal power plants increases the competitiveness among traditional energy generation systems.(c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, a novel nuclear and solar hybridized energy system with onshore and offshore components is designed, analyzed and assessed by using thermodynamic-based energy and exergy approaches. A high -temperature gas-cooled pebble bed reactor is considered in the floating nuclear plant to integrate with a bifa-cial photovoltaic (PV) plant in order to supply heat and electricity to four different communities. The process/ waste heat and excess electricity are exploited via the thermochemical copper-chlorine hydrogen production cycle to store the energy in a chemical form. The offshore floating nuclear plant is integrated with an onshore energy system in various locations to be able to cover the needs more communities. As a case study, The cities, namely Iqaluit, Rankin Inlet, Pond inlet, and Cambridge Bay, in Nunavut, Canada, are investigated with thermodynamic-based analyses. A time-dependent thermodynamic analysis is carried out by using hourly meteorological data and a shift schedule due to the demands of those communities. The integrated system potentially designed for the city of Iqaluit consists of a 25 MWp bifacial PV plant, a polymer electrolyte mem-brane (PEM) fuel cell stack at 15 MW capacity, a 150 MWth offshore-based floating nuclear power plant, which is coupled to a copper-chlorine-based thermochemical cycle for hydrogen production. This integrated system, which is extensively analyzed thermodynamically under dynamic conditions, is able to produce a total of 1648 tons of hydrogen, 47,239 MWh of electricity and 75,900 MWh of heat in a typical meteorological year. For the floating nuclear plant's connected period, both energy and exergy efficiencies are found to be 24.5 % and 19.7 %, respectively. During the floating nuclear plant's disconnected period, the energy and exergy efficiencies are calculated as 39.9 % and 46.0 %, respectively.

AB Accurate prediction of energy demand is crucial to guarantee the secure and stable functioning of integrated energy systems. User-level integrated energy loads are characterized by substantial fluctuations, high randomness, and intricate coupling relationships across multiple energy sources. In this study, an improved FeatureTime Transformer Encoder-Bi-LSTM (FTTrans-E-BL) model, based on the Transformer architecture, is proposed for short-term forecasting of user-level integrated energy loads. Firstly, Windowed Time-Lagged CrossCorrelation (WTLCC) is employed to conduct correlation analysis of influential factors, thereby identifying the factors with strong correlation and their corresponding time lags. Then, an innovative encoder-decoder architecture is proposed for predicting integrated energy loads. In the encoder stage, a feature attention mechanism is employed to acquire the coupling relationships between the integrated energy loads, while a time attention mechanism is used to investigate the significance of the hidden states in every time step. In the decoder stage, bidirectional LSTM is adopted to capture time-series features. Next, Pareto optimization is applied to update the weights of losses to balance multiple forecasting tasks. Finally, on the basis of the aforementioned prediction model, an extension of the probabilistic forecasting model is created. Experiments are carried out to verify the efficacy of the suggested model on real data. In comparison to the traditional LSTM model, the evaluation metrics (e.g. RMSE) for the proposed model's prediction of electricity, cooling, and heating load improve by 87.467%, 78.300%, and 81.512%, respectively. The experimental findings demonstrate the advantages of the presented prediction model.

AB In modern power systems, the reliability of energy supplies is a real challenge for the operators. The emergence of renewable energy resources, along with multi-career users, requires multi-career systems. In this regard, the energy hub (EH) as an integrated system can be used to increase the reliability of the system. The power-to-gas (P2G) and P2G storage are two practical technologies to achieve high efficiency in energy systems. In this paper, the contribution is optimal scheduling of stochastic problem in EH system amalgamated with CHP unit, P2G storage, thermal storage, boiler, wind power, and electrical storage to supply the heat, gas, and power loads by regarding demand response program (DRP). For the electrical loads, the load shifting strategy is considered to minimize the operational cost of the EH system. In order to manage related uncertainties about electricity price, wind power, and electrical loads, the downside risk constraint (DRC) method is applied to investigate the EH system function. According to the obtained results, by increasing approximately 2.8% of the operational cost, the risk level can be reduced remarkably. And also, almost 10% of the energy shifted from peak hours to the off-peak time after DRP is applied. ?? 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The operation scenarios of regional integrated energy systems are becoming increasingly complex, with uncertainty issues becoming more prominent. To enhance the reliability of regional integrated energy systems, reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and lower investment and operational costs, this paper proposes a multi- objective optimization planning method that accounts for the uncertainty of source-load forecasting errors. First, the basic structure is established, and a set of uncertainty scenarios for source-load forecasting errors is generated using the latin hypercube sampling method. Next, clustering techniques are employed to reduce the uncertainty scenario set and extract typical scenarios of source-load uncertainty. Then, a multi-objective optimization model is constructed, considering the uncertainty of source-load forecasting, with total cost, carbon dioxide emissions, and system reliability as objective functions. Subsequently, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm is used to solve the multi-objective optimization function, resulting in a Pareto front set. The optimal solutions from the Pareto front set are selected using a strategy that combines fuzzy entropy theory with comprehensive evaluation, yielding multi-objective optimization planning results for each typical scenario. Through case analysis, compared to the application of single-objective optimization planning that does not consider the uncertainty of source-load forecasting and multi-objective optimization planning that also does not consider this uncertainty,the proposed planning model reduces annual total costs by 1.46 million CNY and 940,000 CNY respectively, carbon dioxide emissions by 16.9% and 9.5% respectively, and improves reliability by 13% and 5% respectively. This indicates the effectiveness of the multi-objective optimization planning model that accounts for the uncertainty of source-load forecasting errors.

AB The disordered energy use in traditional agricultural production has resulted in high energy purchase costs and carbon emissions. The coupling of integrated energy systems with agriculture offers the potential for flexible coordination of agricultural loads while agricultural loads are highly influenced by changes in the natural environment. In this context, this paper proposes a low-carbon and economic scheduling optimization method for agricultural integrated energy system (AIES), which comprehensively takes temperature, light intensity, and the coordination of agricultural loads into consideration. Firstly, solar and biomass resources are integrated through energy conversion equipment to support energy supply from both the electrical distribution network (EDN) and the gas network. At the same time, the modelling process of agricultural load is refined, which is divided into crop irrigation, greenhouse temperature control and residential consumption. The models of agricultural multi-energy complementary and energy storage equipment are established to achieve flexible conversion between different energy sources. In addition, the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) method based on multiple discrete scenarios is adopted to deal with the uncertainties arising from environmental condition fluctuations during the optimization process. Finally, the proposed model is tested on 4 various regions and 2 different seasons. Numerical results show that the proposed model can effectively enhance the economic and environmental performance of the AIES.

ID UNIT COMMITMENT; OPTIMIZATION; ELECTRICITY; DEMAND; HEAT; OPERATION
AB The thermal flexibility of buildings in integrated energy systems (IES) has great potential to improve the operational economy and wind power consumption. To incentivize the thermal flexibility of buildings under uncertainties, we propose a robust nodal pricing (RNP) model for thermal loads based on the Stackelberg game approach. The RNP model adopts a bilevel framework in which the IES operator plays the leader at the upper level while the thermal load aggregators (TLA) play the followers at the lower level. The IES operator problem optimizes the heat prices and dispatch plan, which is modeled as a two-stage robust optimization problem to address the uncertainties in the renewables and the loads. The TLA problem optimizes the thermal loads of buildings to minimize the energy cost and thermal comfort loss, which is modeled as a distributionally robust chance-constrained optimization problem to address the uncertainty in outdoor temperature. Then, we convert the TLA model into deterministic quadratic programming and prove that Slater's condition holds under a mild assumption. Using it, the TLA model is equivalently converted into Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, leading to a reformulation of a classical two-stage robust optimization model for the RNP model. Case studies compare different pricing methods and verify the superiority of the proposed method.

ID ENERGY MANAGEMENT; DISPATCH; MODEL
AB Multi-energy microgrid (MEMG) can effectively coordinate various energy carriers and decarbonize the power system. Several MEMGs in the same distribution network are interconnected to form a multi-microgrid system, where a coordinator exists to coordinate these MEMGs to provide more cost-effective and reliable energy services. However, in this system, protecting each MEMG's information privacy is important. Moreover, the uncertainties caused by supply-demand sides and electricity price challenge the reliable operation of MEMGs. Therefore, this study proposes a hybrid robust decentralized energy management framework for the optimal day ahead scheduling of interconnected MEMGs. Specifically, a decomposition strategy based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is utilized for privacy protection. The Wasserstein metric based distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and the robust optimization (RO) are incorporated to effectively deal with multiple uncertainties. Experimental results show that the coordination of multiple energy carriers (electricity, heat, hydrogen, and gas) can significantly lower the total cost and carbon emission cost (23.39% and 41.64%, respectively). Total cost can also be decreased by 3.15% with the implementation of integrate demand response (IDR). The used ADMM owns excellent performance, which can coverage to the result of centralized manner within a few iterations. Comparative analysis further demonstrated the predictability and superiority of the proposed hybrid robust optimization (HyRO).

AB The growing interest in fully decarbonizing worldwide energy systems requires abandoning traditional generation expansion planning in favour of other flexibility-enabling energy system planning tools allowing the integration of energy storage and sector coupling. Therefore, this paper proposes a mixed-integer linear programming formulation focused on enabling flexibility provision on integrated energy systems targeting independent sizing of power and energy capacities for simultaneous generation and storage expansion planning. The optimization problem minimizes investment, maintenance, operation and emissions costs over a 20 year horizon with hourly resolution. In this context, islands represent suitable study cases for the energy transition due to their exceptional renewable availability, and fast-paced development; despite being regions with extreme external dependence and isolation. In particular, the island of Santiago, Cape Verde is selected as study case given its existing targets regarding reaching 50 and 100% renewable shares in 2030 and 2040, its data availability, and the extreme seasonal variation in wind and solar resources. Four scenarios are considered. The first and second dismiss flexibility: business as usual (BAU), and another one aligned with the government goals (Green). Then, the other two exploit it: one equivalent to Green, FlexG, and a last one finding the Optimal. In addition, three energy demand growth levels are considered in order to reduce uncertainty, corresponding to 1, 3 and 5%. Last, a sensitivity analysis with three additional scenarios is performed to provide a thorough view of Cape Verde's energy future. The results highlight the importance of flexibility exploitation which provides up to 85% savings and allows to decarbonize other sectors via electrification.

AB Utilizing renewable energy sources (RESs), such as wind and solar, to convert electrical energy into hydrogen energy for industrial users with different types of energy storage can enhance the integration of green electricity, thereby replacing fossil fuels like natural gas. In the energy management optimization of industrial electric-hydrogen coupling system (EHCS) with high RESs integration, the traditional optimization methods cannot effectively address the nonlinear characteristics of equipment and stochastic RES generation, while the modelfree reinforcement learning methods struggle to improve the training efficiency and may lead to constraint violation. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a short time scale energy management approach for EHCS based on physical models assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Firstly, the energy management optimization model of the EHCS is developed based on the operation characteristics of the equipment within the system. Secondly, the energy management model of EHCS is formulated as a DRL framework. The DRL agent is efficiently trained with the assistance of the action transformation which takes into account the physical characteristics of the equipment during operation. Finally, a case study is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model for achieving high-efficiency agent training, reducing decision-making time for equipment scheduling, addressing the stochastic RES generation, and realizing the economic operation of EHCS with good performance based on the equipment characteristics.

AB In this paper, we present an optimization planning method for enhancing power quality in integrated energy systems in large-building microgrids by adjusting the sizing and deployment of hybrid energy storage systems. These integrated energy systems incorporate wind and solar power, natural gas supply, and interactions with electric vehicles and the main power grid. In the optimization planning method developed, the objectives of cost-effective and low-carbon operation, the lifecycle cost of hybrid energy storage, power quality improvements, and renewable energy utilization are targeted and coordinated by using utility fusion theory. Our planning method addresses multiple energy forms-cooling, heating, electricity, natural gas, and renewable energies-which are integrated through a combined cooling, heating, and power system and a natural gas turbine. The hybrid energy storage system incorporates batteries and compressed-air energy storage systems to handle fast and slow variations in power demand, respectively. A sensitivity matrix between the output power of the energy sources and the voltage is modeled by using the power flow method in DistFlow, reflecting the improvements in power quality and the respective constraints. The method proposed is validated by simulating various typical scenarios on the modified IEEE 13-node distribution network topology. The novelty of this paper lies in its focus on the application of integrated energy systems within large buildings and its approach to hybrid energy storage system planning in multiple dimensions, including making co-location and capacity sizing decisions. Other innovative aspects include the coordination of hybrid energy storage combinations, simultaneous siting and sizing decisions, lifecycle cost calculations, and optimization for power quality enhancement. As part of these design considerations, microgrid-related technologies are integrated with cutting-edge nearly zero-energy building designs, representing a pioneering attempt within this field. Our results indicate that this multi-objective, multi-dimensional, utility fusion-based optimization method for hybrid energy storage significantly enhances the economic efficiency and quality of the operation of integrated energy systems in large-building microgrids in building-level energy distribution planning.

AB The hydrogen energy storage system (HESS) integrated with renewable energy power generation exhibits low reliability and flexibility under source-load uncertainty. To address the above issues, a two-stage optimal scheduling model considering the operation sequences of HESSs is proposed for commercial community integrated energy systems (CIESs) with power to hydrogen and heat (P2HH) capability. It aims to optimize the energy flow of HESS and improve the flexibility of hydrogen production and the reliability of energy supply for loads. First, the refined operation model of HESS is established, and its operation model is linearized according to the operation domain of HESS, which simplifies the difficulty of solving the optimization problem under the premise of maintaining high approximate accuracy. Next, considering the flexible start-stop of alkaline electrolyzer (AEL) and the avoidance of multiple energy conversions, the operation sequences of HESS are formulated. Finally, a two-stage optimal scheduling model combining day-ahead economic optimization and intra-day rolling optimization is established, and the model is simulated and verified using the source-load prediction data of typical days in each season. The simulation results show that the two-stage optimal scheduling reduces the total load offset by about 14% while maintaining similar operating cost to the optimal day-ahead economic optimization scheduling. Furthermore, by formulating the operation sequences of HESS, the operating cost of CIES is reduced by up to about 4.4%.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Integrated energy systems can realize multi-energy complementarity and energy cascading. Hydrogen energy storage can promote renewable energy consumption, reduce system operation cost and improve system energy efficiency. The heating building has thermal inertia and maintains a certain temperature for a short period of time after the heating is stopped, which will have an impact on the output of the integrated energy system equipment. Therefore, this paper proposes a method to optimize the operation of the integrated energy system considering the thermal inertia of the building and the hydrogen energy storage system. Firstly, an integrated energy system equipment model considering cogeneration equipment and a hydrogen storage system is constructed. Secondly, with the objective function of minimizing the total operating cost and maximizing energy efficiency, the conventional thermal load real-time balancing constraint is replaced with maintaining the indoor temperature within the desired range to construct an integrated energy system operation optimization model considering building thermal inertia and hydrogen storage systems. Finally, a hybrid particle swarm optimization-cuckoo search algorithm based on a Beetle antennae search strategy (BPSO-CS) is proposed for the solution, and the scenario considering building thermal inertia and hydrogen storage systems reduces the total operation cost by 58.77%, improves energy efficiency by 10.61%, and increases the wind power consumption rate by 45.21%.

AB This article is concerned with the multiobjective energy management problem of integrated energy systems (IESs) in a distributed fashion. A multiobjective model is established where the operating costs and gas emissions are treated as competing objectives simultaneously. To achieve optimal energy management with reasonable operating costs and gas emissions, a primal-dual-based distributed algorithm with dynamic weights is proposed to assign the multiple energy sources. By this algorithm, each participant only needs to compute locally and share information among neighbors, and thus it offers better flexibility, reliability, and adaptivity, and lower communication burden compared with some centralized algorithms. Besides, the proposed algorithm can solve the multiobjective problem with no special initialization conditions and lower computational complexity different from existing distributed optimization algorithms for IESs. Furthermore, it is proved that each participant can converge to the global optimal solution asymptotically. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can coordinate the two conflicting objectives of economy and environment simultaneously and obtain the entire Pareto front. The effectiveness and scalability of the proposed algorithm are also validated on a 39-32 power-heat IESs and the integrated energy unit system.

AB This paper proposes a novel decentralized optimal multi-energy flow (OMEF) of large-scale integrated energy systems (IES) in a carbon trading market, to fully exploit economic and environmental advantages of the system considering difficulties of information collection from subareas. The decentralized OMEF is solved by three decentralized optimization algorithms, including auxiliary problem principle (APP), block coordinates down (BCD), and approximate Newton directions (AND). Moreover, a dynamic parameter adjustment is developed for APP and BCD to ensure convergence. So that a cooperative optimization among subareas can be achieved through utilizing only the local information and the boundary information. Finally, case studies of a two -area IES with 8 energy hubs and a three-area IES with 33 energy hubs are carried out to deeply compare the performance of the three decentralized algorithms, together with a thorough analysis about the effect of carbon trading price on the system.

AB Applying high-proportion renewable energy impacts the balance and stability of the park's existing energy system. Park-level energy systems have problems such as energy resource-load demand mismatch and insufficient support capacity of energy system elements. This study proposes the energy resource-project mode-load demand chain and flexibility adaptation issue of park-level integrated energy systems to analyze the chain-type relationships and adaptation among critical functional elements of park-level integrated energy projects. The chain-end flexibility assessment model, chain-link coupling coordination model, and chain flexibility adaptation model are developed and applied to three different types of case parks. The results show that Park I and II have better chain-end flexibility and chain-link coupling coordination than Park III. The flexibility adaptation of the three parks is 0.33 (good adaptation), 0.08 (optimal adaptation), and 0.77 (non-adaptation). The adaptation adjustment analysis indicates that the collaborative optimization of flexibility at each chain end is the primary approach for adjusting the chain adaptation. This study provides a systematic approach for analyzing adaptation and identifying mismatches of park-level integrated energy systems. It offers approach support and strategic insights for park-level system planning, construction, and updating and promotes park-level integrated energy development.

AB The rapid increase in the grid integration demand of intermittent renewable energy (RE) has raised higher requirements for the flexible regulation and energy storage capacity of integrated energy systems (IES) with combined heat and power (CHP) units. To solve the issues of efficient accommodation of high proportion RE and low-carbon economic operation of the system, this study proposes an optimal scheduling method for IES based on a refined joint model of heating networks and buildings. Firstly, a refined thermal energy transmission model integrating heating networks and buildings is established to accurately depict the dynamic thermal energy transmission process within the system. Then, this paper proposes an electricity - carbon demand response considering the dynamic carbon emission factor, guiding users to use electricity in a low-carbon way. A distributionally robust optimization (DRO) scheduling model is established to quantify the impact of RE output uncertainty, which is efficiently solved using the column and constraint generation algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed DRO model ensures the robustness of system operation while improving lowcarbon economic benefits. Notably, the RE consumption rate is increased by 9.52 % compared with traditional scheduling methods, which provides an essential reference for promoting the sustainable development of IES.

AB Energy hub (EH) is a multi-energy system that combines several energy sources to increase energy supply effi-ciency, flexibility, and reliability. In this paper, a stochastic two-step multi-objective optimization method is proposed for multi-EH planning that focuses on economic, environmental, and security concerns. In order to meet the demands for electricity, heating, cooling, hydrogen, natural gas, and water, the proposed model in-cludes several components, such as nonrenewable and renewable energy sources, cogeneration units, converters, and storage systems. Also, price-based demand response programs are implemented to provide demand-side flexibility for EHs. The proposed multi-objective framework investigates the total cost of the system, average reserve index (ARI), emissions of the system, and energy not supplied (ENS), simultaneously. EHs categorize their objectives into main and secondary based on priority. Since the total cost is so important, it has been recognized as the primary objective that is minimized in the first step. Also, the emissions, ENS, and ARI are the secondary objectives that are optimized in the second step simultaneously. The proposed model's efficiency is evaluated using an 18-bus test network in both summer and winter seasons. The simulation results present that the pro-posed model improves the emission, ARI, and ENS by 47.78 %, 53.4 %, and 23.38 % in summer seasons, respectively. And also, the multi-objective framework improves the emission, ARI, and ENS by 45.66 %, 65.84 %, and 52.56 % in winter seasons, respectively.

AB Electricity as a source of energy, is one of the most essential part in our life. In recent time, it is noted that the temperature of earth increases in compare to the previous years. It is caused due to burning of the conventional energy sources such as gas, oil, and coal from thermal power plant and other sources, which brings about global warming. Bases on this fact, we propose a multi-objective mixed-integer programming model to design an electric sustainable supply chain network by considering resiliency and responsiveness. In order to formulate the environmental issues, a power-to-gas (P2G) technology is considered as an environment-friendly system. The presence of P2G can reduce the carbon level and it has some major advantages, i.e., it collects carbon dioxide (CO2) from thermal power plant and then converts CO2 to hydrogen (H-2) with the help of water (H2O) and methane (CH4) gas. The drawbacks in addressing the uncertainty of the parameters are overcome by proposing a novel fuzzy robust flexible programming approach based on Me measure. Thereafter, a new approach namely, multi-choice conic goal programming with utility function is introduced to solve the proposed multi-objective model. Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) in India is considered as a case study about electric network that envisages the sustainable issues of an electric supply chain. Finally, experimental results show that one bio-fuel plant, one photovoltaic plant, one air turbine plant, and two mixed-cycle power plants are build at the end of the scheduled period.

AB To respond to the escalating contradiction between improving economy and reducing carbon emissions, a lowcarbon optimal dispatch model of integrated energy station (IES) considering carbon capture and hydrogen demand is proposed. First, a wind-photovoltaic-hydrogen power (WPHP) integration model is built, giving an effective way of renewable energy accommodating and reliable hydrogen supplying of IES. The WPHP significantly improves system economy and decreases the renewable energy curtailment, especially with a high proportion integrated; Then, a coupling model of carbon capture system (CCS) and power-to-gas (P2G) is built. The model resolves the problem of carbon source of P2G and reduces the carbon net emissions, changing the carbon trading cost from expenditure to profit; Next, an integrated demand response (IDR) model is built covering electricity, gas, cooling, hydrogen load as well as the heating load with different heat grade requirements. The IDR further improves multi-energy users' satisfaction, the economy and stability of IES by decreasing the peakvalley difference and increasing load ratio of multi-energy loads. Finally, an optimal dispatch model of IES is built with the objective of minimizing the cost of economic, carbon emission trading and users' dissatisfaction, and the effectiveness of the model is verified by a numerical example.

AB There are a large number of potential schedulable resources in the integrated energy system of electricity, heat, cold, and gas. However, most of these energy sources are currently operated separately, with low system flexibility, low energy utilization rate, and serious abandonment of wind and solar energy. In order to improve the flexibility of integrated energy systems and the capacity of renewable energy consumption, an economic dispatch of community-integrated energy systems considering demand-side coordinated response is proposed. Firstly, according to various energy characteristics, mathematical models of various energy forms are established, including wind energy, photovoltaic, gas turbine, gas boiler, and other component characteristics modeling. Secondly, an economic optimal scheduling model of community-integrated energy system considering demand side response is established, including the constraints and objective functions of the optimization model, and the optimization model is solved based on the Yalmip toolbox and Cplex solver in Matlab software. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified by a simulation example.

AB This paper considers the optimal capacity allocation of integrated energy systems (IESs) with the power-gas systems for clean energy consumption. First, power-gas network models are established with equality and inequality constraints. Second, a novel full distributed cooperative optimal regulation scheme is designed to deal with the optimal capacity allocation problem. Moreover, to deal with the inequality constraints in IESs, a distributed projection operator is developed such that the system states can be guaranteed within the constraint conditions. Then the convergences of those distributed optimization algorithms were proved for strictly convex objective functions. And the initial conditions of systems for the algorithm are free. The simulation is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the distributed optimazation approach.

AB With the development of integrated energy systems, the penetration of large-scale renewable energy gradually changes the energy structure of power systems. To solve the increasing random load disturbances faced by integrated energy systems and reduce power fluctuation, the optimal power regulation method of multiarea integrated energy systems is studied in this paper. Meanwhile, the intervention of communication network brings uncertainties to integrated energy systems. For example, time-delays and packages loss affect the stability and dynamic performance of integrated energy systems. Considering the above factor, a novel modeling approach for multiarea integrated energy systems based on distributed collaborative event-triggering mechanism is put forward. The stability of integrated energy systems is analyzed by Lyapunov stability theory, and a design method for distributed collaborative optimization regulator of multiarea integrated energy systems is derived. This method integrates transmission mechanism with physical system design to achieve real-time perception and dynamic control. Numerical simulation verifies that the co-design method smooths the fluctuation of system power under random load disturbances, improves the dynamic performance of multiarea integrated energy systems, and enhances data transmission efficiency.

   combustion chamber; Closed hydrogen cycle; Finite element method
AB The paper deals with the problems of hydrogen combustion in an oxygen environment to produce high-temperature steam to be used in electricity generation at various power stations including nuclear power plants (NPP). For example, the use of H-2/O-2 steam generator within a hydrogen energy complex may allow increasing the NPP power and efficiency under operating conditions due to hydrogen steam superheating of the main working fluid in a steam-turbine unit. In addition, the use of the hydrogen energy complex may allow adapting NPP to variable electric load schedules with the increasing share of such power stations as well as developing environmentally friendly technologies for electricity generation. In the paper, a new solution to the problem of the effective and safe use of hydrogen energy at NPP with a hydrogen energy complex has been proposed.
   Technical solutions to hydrogen combustion in an oxygen environment using direct injection of cooling water or water steam into combustion products may have a significant weakness, namely the "quenching" phenomenon occurring during water/water steam injection resulting in the recombination efficiency decrease during the cooling of combustion products which is reflected in the increased proportion of non-condensable gases. In this case, the supply of such mixture to the steam-power cycle may be unsafe, as it could result in the increased concentration of unburned hydrogen in the steam turbine flow path. In the paper, a closed hydrogen cycle along with the hydrogen steam superheating system on its basis has been proposed to solve this problem. The closed-circuit system of hydrogen combustion preventing hydrogen permeation into the working fluid of a steam cycle completely as well as ensuring its full oxidation due to some excess of circulating oxygen has been investigated by the authors.
   Two types of H-2/O-2 combustion chambers for the system of safe hydrogen steam superheating in NPP cycle by using the closed-circuit system of hydrogen combustion in an oxygen environment have been considered in the study. The required parameters of H-2/O-2 steam generator with regard to operating temperature conditions as well as the power range of H-2/O-2 steam generators with the proposed combustion chamber construction design have been determined by mathematical modeling of the combustion and heat mass-exchange processes.

AB Multi-energy supply systems are expected to play an important role in smart grids. Today's energy supply systems are large nodes networks, and different types of energy are needed at each node to satisfy the different energy demands. These different types of energy can then be converted to each other through specific devices. How to decide the ratings of these devices at each node to make the system cost-effective is addressed in this paper. The focus is set on a gas/electricity/heat hybrid network. A hydrogen storage system (fuel cell, electrolyzer, and tanks) is used as electricity storage system, a combined heat and power device is used to produce heat and electric power, etc. A mixed integer linear programming algorithm is used to determine the optimal operation schedule of the system, where the goal is to minimize shed load. A genetic algorithm is also used to search for the best size of each component, where the goal is to minimize the total investment costs. In order to resist to contingency events, betweenness centrality (describing the relative importance of each node) is then used to find the worst case under contingency events. This worst case scenario is used to research about the influence of contingencies on the sizing results. At last, two cases (modified 13-node network and IEEE 30 + Gas 20 + Heat 14 nodes system) are tested using the proposed sizing method. The results show that the renewable energy location, investment cost of components, and the structure of the whole system influence the sizing results. When the installed capacity of photovoltaic panels is reduced by 50%, the capacity of the electrolyzer decreases by 3%, the capacity for the hydrogen tanks increases by 2%; when the investment cost of the fuel cell and electrolyzer decreases by 50%, the capacity of photovoltaic increases by 14%, the electrolyzer increases by 13%, and hydrogen tanks increase by 2%. After considering the worst case contingency event, for case I, the capacity of photovoltaic and fuel cell increase by 12% and 11%, and the electrolyzer increases by 34%; for case II, the capacity of photovoltaic and fuel cell increase by 8% and 11%, and the electrolyzer increases by 57%.

AB The development of integrated energy systems is a significant way of improving energy efficiency and encouraging renewable energy absorption. However, the uncertainty of renewable energy and loads raise severe challenges to integrated energy system planning. Besides, under the low carbon background, the relationship between reducing carbon emissions and increasing the absorption of renewable energy is not investigated clearly in the planning of the park integrated energy system. Thus, this paper proposes a two-stage robust planning method considering low carbon and uncertainty. Firstly, the input-output model of energy conversion equipment in the park integrated energy system is described. Secondly, the objective function and constraints and are set up. Specifically, the carbon emission limits and renewable energy penetration target are introduced in the constraints. On this basis, the two-stage robust planning model with min-max-min structure is established, after transformation, column-and-constraint generation is used for the solution. Case study shows the ability and cost of the park integrated energy system to promote low-carbon emission reduction and renewable energy consumption. Moreover, it proves that although there is some synergy between the low carbon target and the renewable energy consumption target, maximum renewable energy consumption does not mean minimum carbon emissions, and vice versa, and in some cases increasing renewable energy penetration does not necessarily reduce carbon emissions.

AB This paper presents a new mixed-integer linear programming formulation for combined generation, storage and demand response expansion planning. The proposed formulation captures flexibility dynamics in integrated energy systems in long horizons with large temporal resolution. The objective function considers costs related to: investment, operation, emission penalties, fixed and variable maintenance. The considered units are: generators, storage (batteries and hydro-pumped) and demand response units (desalination, power-to-X, electric vehicles and electrolysers). The operation is modelled as an hourly unit commitment including time-dependent startup costs and intertemporal constraints such as ramping limits and minimum up and down times. This flexibility enabling formulation boosts renewable integration and contributes towards decarbonisation of other energy sectors such as transport. A commercial solver is used to evaluate the formulation for large scale cases considering 20 years horizon and 12 full weeks per year imposing minimum renewable shares of 50 and 100% in year 9 and 19, respectively. The formulation exceeds tractability limits of previous works, achieves lower over-installation and renewable curtailment by integrating flexibility in the generation expansion problem, and allows to size demand responsive units if desired.

AB Integrated Energy Systems (IES) represent an effective strategy for increasing the use of renewable energy sources. However, the inherent uncertainty in forecasting both renewable energy generation and loads significantly impacts the accurate dispatching of IES. This paper proposes a two-stage dispatching strategy for ParkLevel Integrated Energy Systems (PIES) based on a master-slave-cooperative hybrid game model. This approach aims to address the aforementioned challenges and achieve cooperative optimization in dispatching across Multiple Park Integrated Energy Systems (MPIES). The strategy comprises two key components: a dayahead master-slave game model incorporating demand response and energy storage, and a real-time cooperative game model based on energy sharing. In the day-ahead stage framework, price signals are used to optimize the energy supplier's output and devise the customer's energy consumption plan, thereby achieving economic dispatch. In the real-time stage, the optimization target is shifted to the load aggregator, which employs cooperative game theory to refine certain plans established during the day-ahead stage. Validation using an MPIES consisting of three PIESs showed that the model can accelerate real-time response time by 7 s, achieve 100 % dispatch accuracy, and reduce energy procurement costs by 3.46 % for the PIESs compared to other dispatch models.

AB This paper establishes a model that considers different types of indices for the coordinated operation of integrated energy systems (IES), such as economic indices, environmental indices, security and stability indices. A many-objective optimization problem (MaOP) is developed to treat each index independently as objectives to participate in the optimization rather than constraints. In order to reduce the dimensionalities of objectives and improve the computing efficiency, a kernel matrix based principal component analysis (KM-PCA) method is proposed to achieve the reduction of non-linear many objectives. In the KM-PCA method, the initial correlation matrix of principal component analysis (PCA) is transformed to a kernel matrix by using the maximum variance unfolding (MVU) method. The KM-PCA aims to generate a smaller set of conflicting objectives with maximum information retention of the original objectives. Simulations studies are conducted on a test IES consisting of a modified IEEE 30-bus electricity network, a 15-node gas network and three distributed district heating and cooling units (DHCs) to verify the effectiveness of the KM-PCA method, and a final solution is selected for the coordinated operation of IES.

AB Considering the diversity of primary energy resources and load characteristics, this paper proposes a multi-attribute decision analysis method for the optimal design of park-level integrated energy systems (PLIES) in different areas. Firstly, a multi-objective optimization model is established to optimize the configuration designs and operation strategy of the PLIES, taking the peak-to-valley electric prices and the price-based demand response into consideration. Then, in order to figure out this model, this paper utilizes a multi-attribute decision analysis (MADA) support framework. The proposed MADA, consisting of a multi-objective optimal method designed with multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and an evidential reasoning-based multiple attribute decision-making method, is capable of tackling the decision analysis problem under various attributes. Finally, a case study is carried out for the hourly dispatch analysis and system utilization comparison, in order to evaluate the economic, energy saving and environmental performance under four park-level areas. The simulation studies indicate that: The PLIES proposed in this paper can alleviate the load pressure in peak horizon, as well as achieve better economic, energy saving and environmental benefits due to the optimal design and operation strategy compared with a separated production (SP) system.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

ID MODEL
AB To address the challenges of multi-energy coupling decision-making caused by the complex interactions and significant conflicts of interest among multiple entities in integrated energy systems, an energy management strategy for integrated energy systems with electricity, heat, and hydrogen multi-energy storage is proposed. First, based on the coupling relationship of electricity, heat, and hydrogen multi-energy flows, the architecture of the integrated energy system is designed, and the mathematical model of the main components of the system is established. Second, evaluation indexes in three dimensions, including energy storage device life, load satisfaction rate, and new energy utilization rate, are designed to fully characterize the economy, stability, and environmental protection of the system during operation. Then, an improved radar chart model considering multi-evaluation index comprehensive optimization is established, and an adaptability function is constructed based on the sector area and perimeter. Combined with the operation requirements of the electric-thermal-hydrogen integrated energy system, constraint conditions are determined. Finally, the effectiveness and adaptability of the strategy are verified by examples. The proposed strategy can obtain the optimal decision instructions under different operation objectives by changing the weight of evaluation indexes, while avoiding the huge decision space and secondary optimization problems caused by multiple non-inferior solutions in conventional optimization, and has multi-scenario adaptability.

AB A model for the electric integration of temperature-controlled transports into decentralized, sector-integrated energy systems of logistics facilities is presented herein. A method for modeling an energy systems interaction with the energy components of a refrigerated trailer (reefer) is also introduced. Furthermore, the optimized integration of all sectors was demonstrated using the open energy modeling framework (oemof). For this purpose, the electricity, heat and transport sectors of a typical logistics company's premises are considered in the context of a case study, spanning the period of one year. Energy costs, CO2 emissions, load peaks, and PV own-consumption are used to evaluate the gradual conversion of reefer preconditioning (pre-cooling and -heating) from diesel fuel into electrical grid supply. A linear solver optimizes the energy system in terms of costs and facilitates the optimized integration of reefers and the sector-integrated energy system, incorporating load peaks and CO2 emissions. The results of the study demonstrate the great potential of reducing costs and emissions through the electrical integration of different numbers of refrigerated trailers and furthermore show the challenges and implications of this for other sectors. Based on the results of the optimization, normalized preconditioning operations were created and divided by setpoint, such as for transferability and comparability. Substituting diesel with electricity for the preconditioning of refrigerated trailers reduces costs and CO2 emissions: 0.89 (sic) and 1.56 kgCO(2) can be saved per normalized electric preconditioning process compared to diesel preconditioning, depending on the setpoint it can be more or less. This positive effect can be enhanced by making optimal use of decentralized PV. The use of battery storage increases self-consumption and reduces load peaks at the grid connection point, thus enabling the optimized integration of preconditioned temperature-controlled transports into sector-integrated energy systems. With optimized use of the battery storage and PV self-consumption, the savings compared to diesel can be increased to 1.12 (sic) and 2.11 kgCO(2) per normalized preconditioning process.

AB Owing to the limited operating regions of combined heat and power (CHP) units, the operation of integrated energy systems suffers from low flexibility, low-cost efficiency, renewable curtailment etc. Meanwhile, as the capacity of renewable energies keeps growing and integrating into power systems, various methods, such as installing electric boilers to enable electricity-heat conversion, have been developed to absorb excessive renewables and increase system operation flexibility. To further increase the system operation flexibility, this study explores the possibilities of utilising electrolysers and hydrogen storage tanks to enable electricity-hydrogen-heat conversion. To better visualise the enhanced flexibility, this study presents extra flexibilities from electric boilers, electrolysers and hydrogen tanks as the equivalent operating region expansion for CHP units. In this study, the system is modelled as a mixed-integer optimisation problem which balances the electricity, heat and hydrogen demands in a 24-hour period. A 6-bus test system is used in the case studies to illustrate the effectiveness of implementing electrolysers and hydrogen storage tanks. The optimisation results show the application of hydrogen energy improves the system operation flexibility, reduces wind curtailment, thereby decreasing fuel consumption and carbon emission.

AB Energy storage (ES) has a significant impact on increasing the use of clean energy and lowering carbon emissions. But the high cost of ES limits its large-scale development. Hence, considering the various scenarios and electric vehicles' uncertainties, this paper develops a three-layer planning and scheduling model for the electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) to assist the shared energy storage power station (SESPS) in serving multi-park integrated energy systems. To assess the model's effectiveness, environmental factors are established. And a profit distribution model based on the Shapley value is established to increase the cooperation enthusiasm of each participant. The results show that: (1) The established model reduced the cost of the multi-park by 55.32% and increased the profit of the EVCS by 775.37%. Comparing to self-operation, the EVCS assisted the SESPS reduced capacity by 26.40% and increased profit by 120.31%. (2) With the participation of ES equipment, the utilization rate of new energy reached 100% and the carbon emission was reduced by 55.77%. (3) The improved Shapley value reduced the SESPS's payback period from 2.13 years to 1.12 years, allowing SESPS operators to work more effectively with multiple participants.

AB The integration of electrical and heating systems has great potential to enhance the flexibility of power systems to accommodate more renewable power such as the wind and solar. This study was to investigate an optimal way to integrate the energy of both systems in urban areas. The amount of energy conversion between the electrical system and heating system was optimally decided so that the demand within both systems could be met at the least operational cost. Besides, the best node to join with the electrical system and heating system was chosen by consideration of the energy transmission loss. The mathematical formulation of the optimization problem was detailed as a large-scale non-linear program (LSNLP) in this paper. A decomposition-coordination algorithm was proposed to solve this LSNLP. At last, a 6-bus electrical power system with 31-node heating transmission system was studied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. The results showed that coordinated optimization of the energy distribution have significant benefits for reducing wind curtailment, operation cost, and energy losses. The proposed model and methodology could help system operators with decision support in the emerging integrated energy systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the context of carbon trading, energy conservation and emissions reduction are the development directions of integrated energy systems. In order to meet the development requirements of energy conservation and emissions reduction in the power grid, considering the different responses of the system in different time periods, a wind-hydrogen integrated multi-time scale energy scheduling model was established to optimize the energy-consumption scheduling problem of the system. As the scheduling model is a multiobjective nonlinear problem, the artificial fish swarm algorithm-shuffled frog leaping algorithm (AFS-SFLA) was used to solve the scheduling model to achieve system optimization. In the experimental test process, the Griewank benchmark function and the Rosenbrock function were selected to test the performance of the proposed AFS-SFL algorithm. In the Griewank environment, compared to the SFLA algorithm, the AFS-SFL algorithm was able to find a feasible solution at an early stage, and tended to converge after 110 iterations. The optimal solution was -4.83. In the test of total electric power deviation results at different time scales, the maximum deviation of early dispatching was 14.58 MW, and the minimum deviation was 0.56 MW. The overall deviation of real-time scheduling was the minimum, and the minimum deviation was 0 and the maximum deviation was 1.89 WM. The integrated energy system adopted real-time scale dispatching, with good system stability and low-energy consumption. Power system dispatching optimization belongs to the objective optimization problem. The artificial fish swarm algorithm and frog algorithm were innovatively combined to solve the dispatching model, which improved the accuracy of power grid dispatching. The research content provides an effective reference for the efficient use of clean and renewable energy.

AB The increasing integration of various energy sources and the adoption of smart grid technologies have revolutionized the way we generate, distribute, and consume energy. While these advancements offer numerous benefits, they also introduce vulnerabilities to cyber-physical attacks. To this aim, this paper investigates a resilient energy management strategy for integrated energy systems. By adopting a switched control approach and incorporating a local estimation mechanism, we have developed a resilient distributed energy management strategy to tackle the energy management problem (EMP) in integrated energy systems (IESs). This methodology demonstrates strong robustness and resilience, successfully detecting data integrity attacks and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Finally, we provide a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed strategy in a real-world scenario.

AB in recent years, large-scale electric vehicles connected to the power grid has a significant impact on demand -side resources. In addition, the vehicle -to -grid technology of electric vehicles introduces more uncertainties, which brings great challenges to the optimal scheduling of integrated energy systems. To solve this problem, this paper fully considers the uncertainty and fluctuation of wind power. Firstly, the objective function of joint configuration is constructed to maximize the utilization of wind power and minimize the planned generation cost of the system. Secondly, the linearized power flow equations are used to represent the relations among the state variables, and the second -order cone relaxation method is applied to deal with the branch power flow constraints, which is transformed into a solvable mixed -integer second -order cone programming model. Finally, the validity of the model is verified by an example. The system achieves obvious peak -shaving and valley -filling effect and improves the economic benefit of the system.

AB An energy hub (EH) provides an effective solution to the management of local integrated energy systems (IES), supporting the optimal dispatch and mutual conversion of distributed energy resources (DER) in multi-energy forms. However, the intrinsic stochasticity of renewable generation intensifies fluctuations in the system's energy production when integrated into large-scale grids and increases peak-to-valley differences in large-scale grid integration, leading to a significant reduction in the stability of the power grid. A distributed privacy-preserving energy scheduling method based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning is presented for the EH cluster with renewable energy generation. Firstly, each EH is treated as an agent, transforming the energy scheduling problem into a Markov decision process. Secondly, the objective function is defined as minimizing the total economic cost while considering carbon trading costs, guiding the agents to make low-carbon decisions. Lastly, differential privacy protection is applied to sensitive data within the EH, where noise is introduced using energy storage systems to maintain the same gas and electricity purchases while blurring the original data. The experimental simulation results demonstrate that the agents are able to train and learn from environmental information, generating real-time optimized strategies to effectively handle the uncertainty of renewable energy. Furthermore, after the noise injection, the validity of the original data is compromised while ensuring the protection of sensitive information.

First, a probability distribution model for wind power is constructed. Then, scenario generation is performed through Latin hypercube sampling and typical scenarios are obtained using the synchronous back propagation elimination method. Finally, the optimal output of each piece of equipment in the system is obtained with the lowest overall cost as the optimization objective. The simulation results validate the effectiveness and low-carbon nature of this method, while reducing costs.

AB Energy storage is crucial for enhancing the economic efficiency of integrated energy systems. This paper addresses the need for flexible resources due to high renewable energy integration and the complexity of managing multiple resources. We propose a decentralized collaborative multi-stage distributionally robust scheduling method for electric-thermal systems, incorporating energy storage to mitigate renewable energy fluctuations. Firstly, we model the electric-thermal system with multiple flexible resources. Uncertain parameters of renewables are estimated using conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs), assuming empirical probability distributions. Secondly, given the distinct operators of electric and thermal systems and information barriers, we develop a data-driven distributionally robust chance-constrained optimization model (DRCCO). This model ensures decentralized collaboration without compromising information security or fairness. Then, we introduce an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm with parallel regularization to decouple the model. This approach facilitates rapid solution finding with minimal information exchange. Finally, numerical examples confirm the model's effectiveness in enhancing system flexibility and ensuring wind power consumption.

AB This paper addresses the problem of distributed energy management in multi-area integrated energy systems (MA-IES) using a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approach. The MA-IES consists of interconnected electric and thermal networks, incorporating renewable energy sources and heat conversion systems. The objective is to optimize the operation of the system while minimizing operational costs and maximizing renewable energy utilization. We propose a distributed energy management strategy that makes hierarchical decisions on intra-area heat energy and inter-area electric energy. The strategy is based on a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework, where each agent represents a component or unit in the MA-IES. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process and employ Q-learning with experience replay and double networks to train the agents. The proposed strategy is evaluated using a simulation of a four-area MA-IES. The results demonstrate significant improvements in energy management compared to traditional methods, with higher renewable energy utilization and lower operational costs. Specifically, the strategy achieves 100% utilization of wind power, and decreases operational costs by 5.53%. Furthermore, it leverages the generalization capabilities of reinforcement learning to respond in real -time to uncertainties in demand and wind power output. The results highlight the advantages of the proposed strategy, making it a promising solution for optimizing the operation of multi-area integrated energy systems.

AB This study presents an optimization management framework for community integrated energy systems. First, the output scenarios of renewable energy are generated by the Monte Carlo method, and the K-means method is used to reduce the scenarios. According to the spatio-temporal characteristics of electric vehicles, this study proposes a charging/discharging decision-making method based on the fuzzy theory. Moreover, an integrated demand response model based on the real-time price mechanism and a two-stage optimization scheduling strategy is formulated. The results show that, compared with two traditional scenarios, the proposed strategy reduces comprehensive operating costs on typical days by 8.81% and 3.22% in summer and 6.55% and 3.33% in winter, respectively, while ensuring overall satisfaction. This study also analyzes the impact of the number of electric vehicles and the weight of the objective function on the optimization scheduling results.

AB Integrated energy systems (IES) with cooling, heat, electricity, and natural gas have drawn significant interest recently as we embrace more sustainable energy a midst climate change. However, the uncertain outputs of distributed generators (DGs) make it challenging for IES planning while maintaining low-cost installation and operation under carbon emission constraints. To tackle the challenge, this work proposes an optimal planning model for IES considering both DG output uncertainties and carbon emission punishments. To reduce the conservatism of the widely-adopted interval and affine algorithms, an affine model based on the matrix form is first proposed to model the uncertain DG outputs. A tiered dynamic charging cost model is further developed to introduce and minimize carbon emissions with a punishment mechanism at the planning stage. Based on these two sub-models, an optimal IES planning model is proposed to simultaneously minimize the overall costs of investment, operation, and carbon emissions. To solve the multi-dimensional nonlinear model, an improved quantum particle swarm optimization (IQPSO) algorithm is introduced with enhanced global optimization ability. Simulation results on the IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus IES network have demonstrated that the proposed method can effectively reduce the impacts of DG uncertainty and carbon emissions at the planning stage of IES with a better long-term economy.

AB Sustainability assessment and flexibility enhancement are the key to achieve efficient and economic, supply-demand matching and comprehensive evaluation of integrated energy systems (IES). Therefore, a joint optimization model of economic, environmental and exergy for IES combining waste heat driven organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power generation and multi-energy storage is developed, and the emergy theory is introduced for system sustainability assessment. Firstly, the mixed-integer nonlinear optimization models for three scenarios of gas turbine (GT) without ORC, GT with ORC (GT-ORC) and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with ORC (SOFC-ORC) are established, and the Pareto curve is obtained by using the augmented epsilon constraint. Secondly, the economic, environmental and exergy efficiency of the optimal decision-making scheme are analyzed, and the system sustainability is evaluated by solar emergy. The results reveal that in the optimal scenario, the SOFC-ORC scenario reduces CO2 emission by 33.2 %, but the annual cost is increased by 45.7 %, and exergy efficiency is lowered by 8.1 % compared to that of the GT-ORC scenario. Then, the emergy sustainability index of the optimal solution for SOFC-ORC scenario is 0.031, which is significantly lower than that in GT-ORC scenario, which is 0.152. The proposed emergy analysis method covers energy, economy, society and environment, and elucidate the developmental sustainability of the system.

AB With the advent of multi-carrier energy systems in the context of local energy markets, e.g., thermal market, virtual energy hub plants have become more prominent in many countries to achieve sustainable energy supply networks. The former researches on techno-economic operation of virtual energy hub plants did not consider the promoted power-to-X (P2X) conversion facilities alongside hydrogen market to assess the energy efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions, and economic issues in an integrated manner. To this end, this paper presents a riskaverse multi-objective method to tackle the self-scheduling problem of the virtual energy hub plant and address the mentioned issues. The considered virtual energy hub plant is operated based on the different energy carriers, i.e., electricity, heating, cooling, and hydrogen, P2X units, electric vehicles, and developed demand response (DR) strategy. The virtual energy hub plant operator tries to maximize its revenue by participating in the local energy markets and minimizing CO2 emission rates considering different uncertain sources. The combined heat and power (CHP) unit and DR strategy are utilized as practical solutions for the instability of renewable power output as well as exploiting opportunities in various local energy markets. To model the proposed strategy, a nonprobabilistic information gap decision theory (IGDT) is developed. The presented model is applied to a sample test case, and numerical results confirm that the profit of the virtual energy hub plant is increased by up to 17.54%, and the CO2 emission rate is reduced by up to 10.24% considering the up-to-date energy storage systems, developed DR strategy, and P2X units.

AB This paper proposes a stochastic day-ahead scheduling framework for integrated energy systems (IES) considering uncertain wind power generation and multienergy loads. The structure and modeling of the IES consisting of electrical, natural gas, and heating networks are presented. The network constraints of the electricity network, natural gas network, and heating network are formulated and incorporated into the optimization model. Uncertainties of hourly wind power and multienergy loads are taken into account by creating multiple representative scenarios with different probabilities using Monte Carlo simulation. The stochastic scheduling model is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem by linearizing the nonlinear constraints, with the objective function of minimizing the total expected operation cost. Numerical results validate the proposed model and demonstrate the impact of natural gas and heating network on IES operation. (c) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB Due to the continuous development of renewable energy as well as the emerging high-efficiency energy conversion techniques, the interdependencies among the heterogenous energy systems, such as power, natural gas, and district heating, are strengthening, which gradually forms the concept of integrated energy systems (IESs) and has drawn much attention from academia and industry. However, few research efforts have been spent on analyzing the interdependencies between IESs and the water distribution system (WDS), especially in the operation time scale, though water is one of the most necessary materials during energy production and conversion. In this article, a robust operation model for the water-energy nexus against the uncertainties of wind generation outputs is proposed to explore the interdependency between the IES and the WDS. The overall model is a two-stage program with a nonlinear program (NLP) in each decision stages, owing to the ubiquitous pressure-flow equations as well as the on/off switching of device operation status. Further, a two-step solution procedure is devised to obtain a solution with good quality, including the mixed integer second-order program based approximation for the original NLPs and the convex optimization based feasibility recovery, which is further embedded into the traditional column-and-constraint generation algorithm to generate a robust solution. Simulation results validate the necessity and the effectiveness of the proposed model and methods.

In the proposed model, the optimization process of different carriers of Multi Energy Hubs (MEH) energy considers a price-based demand response (DR) program with MEH electrical and thermal demands. During the peak period, energy carrier prices are calculated at high tariffs, and other power hubs can help to reduce hub energy costs. The proposed model can handle the random behavior of renewable sources in a correlated environment and find optimal solution for turbines' communication in EHs. The simulation results show the high performance of the proposed model by considering the dependency between wind turbines in MEH structure, power exchange and heat among the EHs.

AB Decarbonising and improving the energy efficiency of dwellings is a priority for climate and energy policy. However, integrated energy systems modelling, commonly used to inform decarbonisation pathways, typically does not capture the heterogeneity of the dwelling stock, particularly internal dwelling temperatures, a key determinant of the cost of switching to low-carbon heating and upgrading building fabric. Addressing this gap, this paper presents a new model of the residential sector within an energy systems optimisation model (ESOM), which is developed using an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) database and measured energy consumption data, allowing for the heterogeneous depiction of the housing stock. The analysis is carried out for Ireland, which has committed to ambitious legally binding climate targets. The Irish residential sector, which represented 22% of energy-related CO2 emissions in 2020, is characterised by poor thermal efficiency and high reliance on fossil fuels. The TIMES Ireland Model (TIM) is developed within a framework demonstrating cost-optimal pathways for energy supply, transformation, and demand sectors.The model is open-source, and the methodology outlined in this study is replicable for any country with an EPC database. The results presented are indicative of the type of insights that such modelling can provide and demonstrate that to meet climate targets, a rapid reduction in residential fossil fuel heating is necessary. The results show that deeper decarbonisation pathways require more thermal retrofits and electrical heat pumps, increasing the total cost of the energy system.The results explore the effect of internal temperatures, highlighting the importance of using empirical data for accounting for the rebound effect. Exemplifying the value of an integrated system modelling approach, deeper decarbonisation pathways place further costs on the electrical system.

AB In the researching background of integrated energy system, a single electricity-gas-heating system (EGHS) can be regarded as an active producer. In order to solve the joint optimization of integrated energy systems under the condition of incomplete information, this paper proposes a distributed optimal scheduling framework of EGHS. First, establish a coupling model of the interconnected EGHS, and perform strict second-order cone convexity of the complex natural gas flow model. Next, use the bus splitting method to realize the decoupling between different regions of the interconnected system, and employ the alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM) to solve the model. Then, construct two-region energy system (78-node grid & x002B;40-node gas grid & x002B;40-node heat grid) and three-region energy system (117-node grid & x002B;60 node gas grid & x002B;60-node heat grid) as simulation examples to verify the effectiveness of the distributed optimization framework. In the end, the algorithm solution process, the effectiveness of scheduling results, and the comparison of optimization results under different interconnection methods are analyzed in detail.

AB The optimal dispatch methods of integrated energy systems (IESs) currently struggle to address the uncertainties resulting from renewable energy generation and energy demand. Moreover, the increasing intensity of the greenhouse effect renders the reduction of IES carbon emissions a priority. To address these issues, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method is proposed to optimize the low-carbon economic dispatch model of an electricity-heat-gas IES. In the DRL framework, the optimal dispatch model of the IES is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP). A reward function based on the reward-penalty ladder-type carbon trading mechanism (RPLT-CTM) is introduced to enable the DRL agents to learn more effective dispatch strategies. Moreover, a distributed proximal policy optimization (DPPO) algorithm, which is a novel policy-based DRL algorithm, is employed to train the DRL agents. The multithreaded architecture enhances the exploration ability of the DRL agents in complex environments. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed DPPO-based IES dispatch method can mitigate carbon emissions and reduce the total economic cost. The RPLT-CTM-based reward function outperforms the CTM-based methods, providing a 4.42% and 6.41% decrease in operating cost and carbon emission, respectively. Furthermore, the superiority and computational efficiency of DPPO compared with other DRL-based methods are demonstrated by a decrease of more than 1.53% and 3.23% in the operating cost and carbon emissions of the IES, respectively.

AB A distributionally robust scheduling strategy is proposed to address the complex benefit allocation problem in regional integrated energy systems (RIESs) with multiple stakeholders. A two-level Stackelberg game model is established, with the RIES operator as the leader and the users as the followers. It considers the interests of the RIES operator and demand response users in energy trading. The leader optimizes time-of-use (TOU) energy prices to minimize costs while users formulate response plans based on prices. A two-stage distributionally robust game model with comprehensive norm constraints, which encompasses the two-level Stackelberg game model in the day-ahead scheduling stage, is constructed to manage wind power uncertainty. Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions transform the two-level Stackelberg game model into a single-level robust optimization model, which is then solved using column and constraint generation (C&CG). Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in balancing stakeholders' interests and mitigating wind power risks.

AB With the crisis of energy and environment, the integrated energy systems (IES) have a bright prospect in future energy reform owing to the excellent economic and environmental performance. The IES combines a large amount of renewable energy (RE), which guarantees its economic and environmental benefits. Many uncertainties of RE threaten the performance of IES. How to promote RE consumption under strong uncertainties is a crucial problem in the scheduling of IES. In this work, a two-stage scheduling strategy for IES combining day-ahead scheduling and real-time scheduling is proposed to guide the system operation. The stage of day-ahead scheduling can obtain the optimal scheduling scheme one day in advance based on the forecast data of RE, and the stage of real-time scheduling is introduced to cope with the uncertainties of RE. The model of IES is established based on the energy hub (EH), and the entire strategy is implemented on this model. The model integrates various energy conversion equipment to give full play to the advantages of coordination and complementation of IES. The improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) is proposed as the solution algorithm of the whole strategy, which improves the traditional PSO through random nonlinearity change inertia weight strategy and best solution perturbation operator (BSPO). Compared with the traditional PSO, IPSO has more excellent performance for solving IES scheduling model. Finally, different schemes under different situations are compared.

AB The construction of integrated energy systems has received widespread attention. In addition to system design and operating optimization, clarifying the internal relationship between the project's own characteristics and its economic indicators is also important for high-value project selection and implementation. Based on various energy prices and the climatic characteristics of typical cities, 60 integrated energy supply projects in 4 typical cities were used as a case study, and the cold and heat source system solutions with the shortest investment payback period for each project were calculated through a system optimization model. We calculated the correlation coefficient between the initial investment of system equipment, annual energy supply, annual energy sales revenue, annual equivalent full-load energy supply hours, initial equipment investment indicators for annual unit energy supply, and the project's static investment payback period. The key factors affecting the static investment payback period of the project were identified. The results show that, under the optimal system scheme, even for buildings of the same type in the same area, the economic indicators of different integrated energy projects are still quite different. Under the current design, operation, and operation conditions, load distribution is the decisive factor for the economic feasibility of the project. The static investment payback period of the project can be quickly calculated based on the equivalent full-load energy supply hours of the project throughout the year. Compared with the current numerical and system dynamics model for point-to-point single system optimizing modeling, the proposed statistical regression model can help reveal the main factors of integrated energy system's economically feasible.

AB The energy hub (EH) is a promising concept that can accurately evaluate the performance of multi-carrier integrated energy systems (IESs), ranging from a building to a district, city, region, country, or even an international level. Multi-carrier EH-based IESs available in the literature have reached a desirable level of maturity for broad scales. However, there is confusion in the literature that misleads readers regarding multi-carrier EH-based IESs located on limited scales (e.g., buildings or neighborhood level). Furthermore, multi-carrier EH-based IESs studies that involve complexities such as discrete, continuous, or mixed decision-making variables, multiple conflicting objective functions, non-linearity, non-convexity, and discontinuity are affected by different technoeconomic, environmental, and social parameters that are uncertain. Ignoring such uncertain input parameters (UIPs) in these studies leads to less adaptable results to realistic conditions. However, their integration is a challenging process intensifying these complexities during studies' modeling, optimization, and decision-making processes. Therefore, this review paper aims to fill these gaps by identifying, classifying, assessing, and prioritizing different UIPs, their analyzing techniques, and solution approaches, solvers, and software for addressing relevant optimization problems to achieve a deeper understanding of current challenges and potential future research, trend, and capacities in multi-carrier EH-based IESs studies.

AB The increasing use of renewable energy sources introduces significant fluctuations in power generation, demanding enhanced regulatory capabilities to maintain the balance between power supply and demand. To promote multi-energy coupling and the local consumption of renewable energy, integrated energy systems have become a focal point of multidisciplinary research. This study models adjustable sources, networks, and loads within electric-thermal integrated energy systems as energy storage entities, forming virtual energy storage systems to participate in the optimization and scheduling of integrated energy systems. This paper investigates the modeling and control strategies of virtual energy storage systems within electric-thermal integrated energy systems. Initially, it introduces the definition, logical architecture, and technical connotations of virtual energy storage.

AB The optimization of multi-community integrated energy systems (MCIES), as a proficient means of integrating distributed energy resources and diverse loads, poses a compelling challenge. This challenge revolves around strategically harnessing the energy-carbon synergy advantages within these systems, while factoring in the heterogeneity among different communities and the constraints imposed by electrical connectivity devices. Facing the challenge, this paper proposes an individualized adaptive distributed approach for energy-carbon coordination in MCIES with power transformers (PT-MCIES). Firstly, a feasible region is constructed based on current and temperature limits to assess the loading capacity of power transformers. Based on this, a transactive energy (TE) based co-optimization model for PT-MCIES considering energy sharing and carbon trading is developed, where rolling horizon optimization is adopted to cope with the randomness from renewable energy and loads. For the TE problem, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is employed to achieve distributed optimization. Uncertain renewable energy and loads, along with variable rolling horizons, make it difficult for the traditional ADMM to ensure convergence speed in the co- optimization of PT-MCIES. Accordingly, an individualized adaptive ADMM (IAADMM) embedded a spectral penalty parameter selection rule is adopted. Simulation results show that the proposed scheduling model can effectively guarantee the safe operation of power transformers with the suggestion of a feasible region, and achieve higher economic and environmental benefits than the reference one that ignores energy-carbon coordination. Furthermore, the proposed IAADMM exhibits superior performance in terms of convergence speed and robustness to the initial penalty parameter when compared to ADMM and its various variants.

AB An exergy-electrical analogy, similar to the heat transfer electrical one, is developed and applied to the case of integrated energy systems operating in buildings. Its construction is presented for the case of space heating with electric heaters, heat pumps and solar collectors. The proposed analogy has been applied to a set of system arrangement options proposed for satisfying the building heating demand (space heating, domestic hot water); different alternatives to connect the units have been presented with switches in a visualization scheme. The analogy for such situation has been performed and the study of a solar assisted heat pump using ice storage has been investigated. This diagram directly permits energy paths and their associated exergy destruction to be visualized; hence, sources of irreversibility are identifiable. It can be helpful for the comprehension of the global process and its operation as well as for identifying exergy losses. The method used to construct the diagram makes it easily adaptable to others units or structures or to others models depending on the complexity of the process. The use of switches could be very useful for optimization purposes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In rural locations, energy storage options were limited to discrete forms. Complementary advantages among energy sources such as electricity, heat and gas cannot be fully utilized. Integrated energy systems can optimize the distribution of electricity, gas, heat, and energy storage to utilize different energy sources efficiently. This paper uses a multi-period demand response model that considers electricity prices. On this basis, an electric-gas-heat-coupled energy storage model is built. The purpose of the objective function is to decline the whole economic expenditure, maximize the consumption of renewable power, and limit the annual CO2 emissions. This can be accomplished by employing advanced evolutionary algorithms for non-dominant classification. To solve the objective function, a reformative Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is applied. Upon analysis, the findings indicate that after considering the two categories of demand response, all loads reduce their energy consumption costs by shifting part of their load to hours with lower peak power values, and the curves for all loadtypes are flatter than beforeincorporatingdemandresponse.

AB Power-to-gas technology provides an emerging pathway for promoting green and low-carbon transformation of energy systems. Through the processes of electrolyzing water and the methanation reaction, it converts surplus renewable energy into hydrogen and natural gas, offering an effective approach for large-scale integration of renewable energy sources. However, the optimization of existing integrated energy systems has yet to finely model the operational characteristics of power-to-gas technology, severely limiting the energy conversion efficiency of systems. To address this issue, this paper proposes an integrated energy system operation strategy considering the slow dynamic response characteristics of power-to-gas. Firstly, based on the technical features of power-to-gas, an operational model for electrolyzing water to produce hydrogen is constructed, considering the transition relationships among cold start-up, hot start-up, and production states of a methanation reaction, thereby building a power-to-gas operation model considering slow dynamic response characteristics. This model finely reflects the impact of power-to-gas operational states on methanation, facilitating accurate representation of the operational states of methanation. Then, considering the energy conversion constraints and power balance of various coupled devices within integrated energy systems, an optimization model for the operation of the integrated energy system is constructed with the total daily operation cost of the system as the optimization objective. Finally, simulation comparisons are conducted to demonstrate the necessity of considering the slow dynamic response characteristics of power-to-gas technology for integrated energy system operation. The case study results indicate that the proposed power-to-gas operation model can accurately simulate the methanation process, facilitating the rational conversion of surplus renewable energy into natural gas energy and avoiding misjudgments in system operation costs and energy utilization efficiency.

AB In integrated energy systems, adjusting the energy conversion of a coupling unit changes the power flow in the connected energy systems. Also, it forces other units to adapt their generation to keep the energy balance in the energy systems. The impact on the power flow and the complexity of the interaction between single networks will increase the more coupling units are installed. The impact on the power flow can be determined by power flow calculation and optimization algorithms. However, to analyze the impact of a unit's power change on all state variables, the available methods need to solve a second power flow or optimization. This is computationally effortful and time-consuming. Hence, this paper proposes a method that estimates such a change easily and quickly. The method extends the widely used approach of sensitivity factors in electric power system analysis to electricity-heating integrated energy systems. The sensitivity factors are derived in a straightforward way by linearization using the Jacobian matrix of a coupled power flow calculation before the change. These new sensitivity factors can precisely estimate the impact of a change on the energy system's power flow and reduce the calculation time of new setpoints by factor eight on average.

AB The field of utilizing machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence for studying and optimizing compressed air energy storage integrated energy systems with solid oxide fuel cells is of utmost importance. Further studies in this field are of great significance and should be pursued to unlock the full potential of these integrated energy systems. This study proposes an integrated energy system combining compressed air energy storage (CAES) and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) to generate compressed air, power, and heating. The SOFC generates electricity, part of which powers the CAES system for compressed air production. Flue gases from the SOFC activate domestic heat recovery, resulting in heating air capacity. Machine learning techniques predict system performance and optimize it for best results. Machine learning algorithms developed using regression analysis have high accuracy with R-squared values >98 % for all outputs and they perform well to predict the new observation with predicted R-squared values mostly >99 %. Also, its act in optimizing the system performance is significant. By choosing a utilization factor of 0.795 and a current density of 4300 A/m(2), the energy efficiency can reach 63.4 % while the exergy efficiency can reach 32.5 %. These values align with the predicted ranges given by the machine learning models.

AB Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is effective in solving complex, non-linear optimization problems, which is particularly relevant in energy management within Integrated Energy Systems (IESs). However, DRL approaches conventionally focus on single -objective policy learning, which is inadequate for the multi -objective optimization tasks commonly encountered in IESs energy management. To improve this, these approaches typically combine multi -objectives, such as operating cost objective and safety objective into a single reward function using scalarization techniques. This reduces the fidelity and interpretability of the objective space and limits its applicability to a wide range of IESs energy management. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel framework called Multi -Agent and Multi -Objective DRL (MAMODRL). This framework combines value function decomposition and policy gradient methods to achieve a Pareto-optimal solution. The IESs energy management is initially formulated as a multi -objective Markov decision process. Then, an advanced MAMODRL architecture is developed, which includes objective value function networks to facilitate policy optimization. Finally, based on the definition of dominance, Pareto frontier is approximated of IESs energy management. A case study suggests that the proposed approach is effective in solving the Pareto frontier for IESs energy management. To ensure the safe operation of the system, safety threshold is set at the Pareto frontier forming a Pareto optimization with safety conditions. Compared to traditional DRL approaches, the proposed approach is more flexible, interpretable, and capable of making multi -dimensional decisions.

AB In this study, an energy storage configuration optimization model of multi regional integrated energy system based on integrated scheduling and stepped Carbon emission trading is proposed. By analyzing the steady-state, dynamic, and variable operating characteristics of multi regional integrated energy systems, a distributed energy planning modeling method was adopted to construct energy storage configuration constraint objects and optimization models. The target scheme of energy storage configuration is optimized by using the results of integrated scheduling scheme and dynamic distribution analysis of ladder Carbon emission trading, and the parameters are optimally estimated by using Monte Carlo method and quadratic fitting algorithm. The simulation results show that this method has a strong scheduling capability in the context of stepped Carbon emission trading, can accurately assess the load demand and supply demand relationship, reduce carbon emissions, and improve energy efficiency, with an average of 0.9121.

AB The global surface temperature had increased by about 1 degrees C relative to the 1850-1900 period by the end of the 2010s, leaving limited safe operating space and thus a more stringent need to combat climate change to accomplish the Paris Agreement. As one of the world's major greenhouse gas emitters, China has reaffirmed its commitment to emission reduction with the announcement of the carbon neutrality goal in 2020. A fundamental transformation of the current energy structure is necessary, considering that the power sector is a major contributor to national emission. Moreover, China dominates the global methanol and ammonia markets. The nexus between the electricity sector and chemical sector, represented by methanol and ammonia, is considered a promising direction for future decarbonization. This study investigates the cost-optimal transition pathway of the electricity-chemical nexus in China. A bi-level adaptive optimization framework consisting of an upper-level capacity expansion model and a lower-level annual operation model is developed. High-resolution results show that carbon neutrality can be achieved for the co-supply of electricity, methanol and ammonia in China by 2060 through a systematic shift towards combined deployment of low-carbon and negative emission technologies. Sector coupling significantly improves the effectiveness of the transition. The power sector decarbonizes chemical production via green hydrogen, reducing carbon intensities of methanol and ammonia from 3.5 kg CO2-eq kg(-1) to 1.6 kg CO2-eq kg(-1) and 4.8 kg CO2-eq kg(-1) to 1.1 kg CO2-eq kg(-1), respectively. Meanwhile, sector coupling accelerates technology learning by at most 4% in the capital cost of solar photovoltaics, increases renewable penetration by nearly 5% in primary electricity generation, and reduces the power curtailment rate to below 5% by 2060. Green methanol and ammonia, as well as power transmission, all play a role as energy carriers in the future energy system. While grid transmission contributes to balancing the spatially uneven distribution of renewable resources, the equivalent energy transmission via green chemicals complements the former leveraging its relatively light dependence on infrastructure and high flexibility in operation scheduling. According to the analysis of this study, an optimized inter-sectorial integration provides a feasible and promising roadmap to realize carbon neutrality in both the power and chemical sectors.

AB Hybrid hydrogen-battery (HHB) based energy storage technologies have recently become matters of significant interest to enable sustainable and net zero-emission microgrids characterized with high penetration levels of variable renewable energy sources (RES) such as solar and wind. In this regard, there are multiple objectives and constraints controlling the scheduled decision-making framework that manages these microgrid resources while supplying the demand. As such, this paper introduces an integrated energy management system (IEMS) to concurrently optimize the operation schedule of the HHB storage system and provide demand response (DR) via adequate shifting slots for the elastic loads of a microgrid setup. The proposed IEMS aims to optimally manage the microgrid's energy by minimizing three conflicting objective functions: the electricity and battery degradation costs, customers' discomfort, and peak-to-average ratio (PAR). The proposed IEMS is developed for microgrids containing a mix of variable RES, an HHB storage system, and a local power consumption considering dynamic grid tariff. The IEMS is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear problem and is solved using a multi-objective artificial hummingbird optimizer (MOAHA). To account for the variability and uncertainty of RES, the proposed IEMS is tested under four scenarios: good, bad, average weather scenarios, and a forecasted weather profile based on a stochastic model of RES. The performance of the proposed IEMS is evaluated via comprehensive comparative analyses with the conventional energy management strategy (CEMS) without and with consideration of the HHB storage system and DR. Moreover, the performance of MOAHA has been assessed versus the state-of-the-art multi-objective particle swarm optimizer (MOPSO). For the purpose of these comparisons, four quality metrics have been utilized to quantify the benefits of the proposed IEMS: renewable contribution factor (RCF), greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, loss of power supply probability (LPSP), and saving cost (SC). The results show that the proposed IEMS yields better-optimized values that help the microgrid operator identify the sweet spot of the conflicting objectives, where it has increased the customer saving to be (82.95%, 29.65%, 33.33%, and 33.00 %), (73%,23.94%, 25.49%, and 31.65%) and (10.69%,3.62%, 1.59%, and 1.67%) compared to the CEMS without/with including HHB. and IEMS based-MOPSO over the four studied scenarios, respectively. Also, the results show the superiority of the proposed IEMS in improving the identified four quality metrics compared to the CEMS without/with considering HHB storage systems and IEMS-based-MOPSO. Accordingly, integrating HHB and implementing optimized IEMS based-MOAHA with considering the DR approach plays a vital role in providing a profit for the customer, protecting the environment from emissions, and enhancing the system's reliability with considering the weather uncertainty.

AB It is of great significance to introduce the conception of a sharing economy into the electricity industry, which can promote the dispatch of multiple integrated energy systems. On the one hand, it is difficult to reveal the behaviors of complex players with multi-energy coupling through the traditional centralized optimization method of single electric energy. On the other hand, the uncertain fluctuations of renewable energy, such as wind power and photovoltaic, have posed great challenges to market transactions. First, the relationship and the functions of all stakeholders in the system are described in this paper, followed by the establishment of flexible resource models such as demand response and energy storage devices. On this basis, a low-carbon dispatching framework of multiple regional gas-electric integrated energy systems is then constructed under the guidance of cooperative game theory. The contribution indexes are established to measure the degree of energy sharing among the subsystems, and the method of asymmetric Nash bargaining is used to settle the interests of each subsystem. Second, a robust optimization model of multiple regional systems is established in response to multiple uncertainties from renewable energy and load. Finally, the numerical example proves that the proposed mechanism can increase the benefits of each integrated energy system player. Moreover, it helps the system to yield optimal benefits in the face of uncertainties and provides a reference on how to realize energy sharing under uncertainties from source load.

AB Coordinated siting and sizing for energy stations and supply networks in low-carbon park-level integrated energy systems are significant for economic improvement and carbon emissions reduction. To minimize total planning costs and carbon emissions of park-level integrated energy systems, a two-stage coordinated siting and sizing framework for the energy station and supply network of a low-carbon park-level integrated energy system considering generalized energy storage is proposed in this paper. In the first stage, a siting optimization submodel for the energy station and supply network in park-level integrated energy system is established to minimize the total comprehensive energy distance values from the energy station to all load stations, in which the virtual network flow theory is introduced to characterize and linearize the connectivity constraints of the supply network. Then, a sizing optimization submodel for the energy station and supply network in park-level integrated energy system is proposed in the second stage based on the optimal siting strategies of park-level integrated energy system, in which the generalized energy storage is considered to minimize planning costs and carbon emissions. Finally, case studies are conducted on an improved 55-bus park-level integrated energy system to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other existing planning models in terms of achieving lower total comprehensive energy distance values, total planning costs and carbon emissions.

AB Phase change materials have received many attentions during last years owing to their potentials for thermal energy storage. High latent heat of these materials enables improved storage density that translates into compact form factors of a thermal energy storage unit. Phase change materials (PCMs) can be integrated with various energy systems, such as solar systems, building energy systems, HVAC, domestic water heaters, cooling of electronics devices, etc. For more exploiting the energy flexibility of the PCMs combined with energy systems, the optimization and prediction of PCMs in such systems are important. Due to the time-consuming of the optimization processes, high potentials of machine learning techniques (MLTs) are proved. Moreover, the MLTs have also shown high potentials in controlling the predicted data by the models for PCMs integrated energy systems. In this study, a review on the applications of MLTs in energy systems combined with PCMs is conducted. The perspective and suggestions of MLTs in PCMs combined energy systems are provided as road map for future studies.

AB To achieve efficient energy management in complex integrated energy systems (IESs) with renewable energy sources (RESs) and multiple energy storage systems (ESSs), the study aims to propose a novel approach. Evolutionary-based methods are difficult to find the optimal scheme, while deep reinforcement learning (DRL)based methods face problems with low training efficiency. To address the limitations, a knowledge-networkembedded DRL method is proposed, which combines the fast-searching capability of genetic algorithm (GA) with the environment-aware decision-making capability of DRL, with the aim of developing a highly efficient energy management strategy in improving user comfort and reducing operating costs. GA is used to solve the IES optimization model for obtaining a solution set that serves as domain knowledge, and a knowledge network is constructed using deep learning (DL). Then, DRL uses this network as an actor network to explore the optimal strategy. The use of GA helps the DRL to enhance training efficiency and find an optimal strategy. Simulations show significant improvements in cost reduction (5.7 %) and user comfort (4.2 %), along with improved training efficiency (58.3 %) compared to baseline DRLs.

AB A low-carbon economic optimization dispatch model of integrated energy system is proposed to improve the low-carbon and economic efficiency of the integrated energy systems. Firstly, the waste heat generator with the organic Rankine cycle is introduced into the combined heat and power to decouple the combined heat and power operation, and a coupled model with an organic Rankine cycle, power to gas, combined heat and power and carbon capture system is established. Then, the ladder-type carbon trading mechanism is introduced to improve the low-carbon model. Finally, the function is established to minimize the sum of energy purchase costs, operation and maintenance costs, and environmental costs. The proposed integrated energy systems' low-carbon economic dispatch model reduces the total operating cost by 18.9% and the carbon emissions by 83.7% by setting up different models for comparative analysis.

AB Dynamic energy dispatch is an integral part of the operation optimization of integrated energy systems (IESs). Most existing dynamic dispatch schemes depend heavily on explicit forecast or mathematical models of the future uncertainties. Due to the randomness of renewable energy generation and energy demands, these approaches are limited by the accuracy of forecasting or model. A novel model-free dynamic dispatch strategy for IES based on improved deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed to solve the problem. The IES dynamic dispatch problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), in which the uncertainties of renewable generation, electric load and heat load are considered. For solving the MDP, an improved deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm using prioritized experience replay mechanism and L-2 regularization is developed, so as to improve the policy quality and learning efficiency of the dispatch strategy. The proposed approach does not require any forecast information or distribution knowledge, and can adaptively respond to the stochastic fluctuations of the supply and demands. Simulation results show the proposed dispatch strategy has faster convergence and lower operating costs than original DDPG-based strategy. In addition, the advantages of the proposed approach in terms of cost-effectiveness and stochastic environmental adaptation are validated. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the context of carbon peak and carbon neutrality target of China, multi-energy systems have become a key way to meet the needs of a low-carbon economy in the energy sector, and can achieve optimization and integration of multi-energy sources. For the purpose of maximize the low-carbon and economic of multi-energy systems, this paper proposes an optimization operation strategy of electricity-heat-gas integrated energy systems (EHGIES) based on bi-directional tiered-pricing carbon trading. The paper first establishes a multi-energy system model with CHP system and P2G conversion, introduces a bi-directional tiered-pricing carbon trading mechanism. Subsequently, an optimization model with objective function of the lowest carbon trading cost and energy purchase cost is established. The nonlinear optimization model is converted to a linear model by the CPLEX solver. Finally, this paper analyzes the trading mechanism, the interval length of tiered-pricing and carbon trading price on carbon emissions and carbon trading cost of EHGIES. The results show that different carbon trading price ranges and price growth rates have different impacts on carbon emissions and carbon trading costs. At the same time, the bi-directional tiered-pricing carbon trading mechanism established can reduce the overall carbon emissions effectively and is conducive to the low-carbon operation, and the low-carbon and economic nature of system operation can effectively be taken into account.

AB In integrated energy system modeling, extant research predominantly addresses single-energy system optimization or carbon emission flow models, failing to adequately elucidate the mechanisms of combined energy and carbon flow modeling in complex energy systems. This deficiency hampers a thorough analysis of the coupling relationships between energy and carbon flows, thereby posing significant challenges for resource allocation and carbon mitigation within integrated energy systems. This paper presents an innovative energy-carbon coupling model, constructing a unified framework for energy and carbon flow modeling centered on the energy hub, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional approaches that are unable to model both energy and carbon flows concurrently. The model comprehensively examines the coupling nodes and carbon density correlations among energy conversion devices within multi-energy systems, precisely quantifying carbon emission paths and distribution across devices. This provides a novel methodology for carbon emission management in integrated energy systems. Case studies on typical integrated energy systems demonstrate the proposed model's efficacy in low-carbon economic dispatch. The energy-carbon coupling model developed in this study offers a high-adaptability solution for integrated energy systems in multi-energy, low-carbon parks, achieving an optimal balance between economic efficiency and environmental performance under dual objectives of energy demand and carbon emission minimization.

AB Developing integrated energy systems have been considered a feasible pathway to renewable-powered energy systems. The power to hydrogen technology is recognised as a promising method to enhance the economics of integrated energy systems and help reduce renewable curtailments. However, oxygen-enriched gas, which is the by-product of power to hydrogen processes (electrolysation), has not been fully utilised yet. It can be purified to produce medical oxygen at a low cost and may further increase the economics of integrated energy systems. Particularly, at this very moment, the consideration of the combined production of hydrogen and medical oxygen also has the potential to relieve the shortage of medical oxygen due to the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). This study proposes a model for the operation of integrated energy systems that consider the combined production of hydrogen and medical oxygen. This model is formulated as a convex mixed-integer optimisation problem that balances the electricity, heat and hydrogen demands every hour in a 24-hour period and balances oxygen demand on a daily basis. A test case of Taizhou City has been studied and results show that the combined production of hydrogen and medical oxygen improves the integrated energy system economics.

AB With the increasing installed capacity of wind power and the interdependencies among multiple energy sectors, optimal operation of integrated energy systems (IES) with combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) is becoming more important. This paper proposes an optimal dispatch strategy for IES with CCHP and wind power. Natural gas system is modeled and its security constraints are integrated into the optimal dispatch model. The gas shift factor (GSF(gas)) matrix for natural gas system is derived to quantify the impact of gas supply and load at each node on the gas flow through the pipelines so that the pipeline flow equation is linearized. The objective function of the optimization model is to minimize the total operation cost of IES. Then the model is transformed into mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation to improve the computation efficiency. Numerical case studies conducted demonstrate the lower operation cost of the proposed model facilitating wind power integration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article proposes a multi-objective and multi-stage low-carbon planning approach for park integrated energy systems (PIES) considering the impacts of random outages from the superior electrical grid. This approach incorporates optimal multi-stage construction sequencing and stepped carbon emission trading to leverage the economic and low-carbon benefits of long-term planning. First, the islanding modes of PIES are described using four random variables: island type, duration, start time, and typical day of occurrence, from which islanding scenarios are generated based on scenario tree. Next, a multi-objective planning model that considers both economics and reliability is constructed, with the objectives of minimizing the total lifecycle planning cost and the expected economic loss during islanding. The improved Normalized Normal Constraint (NNC) method is proposed to solve the multi-objective planning problem. Then, the fuzzy membership function is used to determine the optimal compromise solution, resulting in a planning scheme that balances economic efficiency and supply reliability. Finally, simulations indicate that, at the cost of a slight increase in planning expenses, the proposed model significantly reduces the loss costs under islanding modes compared with single-objective economic-focused planning. Additionally, the improved NNC method can achieve a more uniform Pareto frontier compared with the conventional NNC method.
   This article proposes a multi-stage low-carbon planning approach for park integrated energy systems (PIES) that considers the impacts of random outages from the connected superior electrical grid.

AB Coordination of different energy resources provide specific opportunities to improve energy efficiency, higher service reliability, better power quality, reduce environmental pollution and flexibility of the energy supply. This paper presents a novel optimal operation and planning for the integrated energy systems (IESs). The IES inherits several forms of energy supply, energy storage system and energy conversion equipment, and achieves the coupling of different types of energy in different links such like network, charge and source. The main challenge and complicate of the operation of IESs is determining the optimal interaction between different energy types for supplying electric and thermal loads in order to improve overall energy utilization efficiency. To implement this challenge, an integration of natural gas network with a modified IEEE 33 bus electricity system connected to the upstream power grid has been used to examine the system performance over a wide range. In this research, the multi-objective optimization problem is employed in order to reduce total net emissions and operating costs simultaneously. Due to the uncertainty related to day-ahead forecasts (24 h), a Monte Carlo simulation is utilized to estimate renewable energy resources, thermal, and electric loads. The adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) technique is used to minimized the IES's operating costs. Using the APSO method, the operational costs are reduced by 2.96% and 4.62%, in comparison with PSO and genetic algorithm (GA), respectively. Also, the amounts of emissions are reduced by 4.68% and 6.03% than the PSO and GA methods, respectively. The proposed method can outperform others on system operating cost and distributed energy resource utilization with satisfactory energy-efficiency and environmental performance.

AB Integrated energy systems and multi-energy micro-grids are complex multi-agent collaborative optimization projects. According to the operating structure and characteristics of the multi-energy system, considering the externality, economy and other factors, a scientific and effective comprehensive evaluation are important decision supports to ensure its implementation and promote its development. Therefore, this paper proposes a comprehensive benefit evaluation model of a multi-energy micro-grid based on the matter-element extension model. With the research trends and practical requirements of multi-energy micro-grid benefit evaluation, an evaluation index system covering energy efficiency indicators, economic indicators, reliability indicators, and renewable energy consumption indicators has been constructed, and uncertainties have been resolved in cloud model and fuzzy set theory. Based on the advantages of the performance evaluation information, the system operation scenarios in the process of planning scheme formation are fully considered, and then a matter-element-extensible multi-attribute decision-making model is proposed to evaluate the comprehensive benefits of multi-energy micro-grids. Finally, the feasibility of the above method is verified by comparing the comprehensive benefit evaluation results of the multi-energy micro-grid under different planning scenarios. In addition, a certain decision-making reference is provided for the formation of a multi-energy micro-grid configuration scheme.

AB In this paper, a deep reinforcement learning-based energy optimization management method for hydrogenelectric coupling system is proposed for the conversion and utilization and joint optimization operation of hydrogen, wind and solar energy forms considering information uncertainty on the demand side of smart grid. Based on the wind energy, photovoltaic energy generation and load forecast information, the method uses deep Q network to simulate the energy management strategy set of the hydrogen-electric coupling system, and obtains the optimal strategy through reinforcement learning to finally realize the optimal operation of the hydrogenelectric coupling system based on the demand response. Firstly, based on the energy management model, a research framework and equipment model for integrated energy systems is established. On the basis of fundamental theories of reinforcement learning framework, Q-learning algorithm and DQN algorithm, the empirical replay mechanism and freezing parameter mechanism to improve the performance of DQN are analyzed, and the energy management and optimization of integrated energy system is completed with the objective of economy. By comparing the performance of DQN algorithms with different parameters in integrated energy system energy management, the simulation results demonstrate the improvement of algorithm performance after inheriting the set of strategies, and verify the feasibility and superiority of deep reinforcement learning compared to genetic algorithm in integrated energy system energy management applications.

AB This paper optimizes the design and operation of integrated distributed energy systems of large buildings and light industrial plants. The integration reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the annual total cost (ATC) beyond the best possible from individual energy systems and there is a sharp optimum with respect to the size of the confectionary plant, which maximizes the reduction of GHG emissions and minimizes ATC. In contrast to previous studies, the design accounts for plant heating demands at different temperature levels and sets plant production volumes as decision variables. Optimal design, operation, and production schedule have been determined via a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model. Integrated energy systems of two entities (confectionary plant and residential building) have been compared to the non-integrated entities equipped with combined cooling, heating, and power systems. The lowest ATC (-8%) of the integrated system and the maximum GHG reductions (-8.3%) occur at slightly different sizes of the plant. Such reductions require simultaneous optimization of integrated design and operation of energy systems and relative sizes of the confectionary plant and the residential building.

AB The concept of multi-energy systems (MES) is widely applied in various areas of energy supply. This approach makes it possible to analyze the distribution of energy flows and their mutual influence both for local facilities and for power supply systems. At the same time, currently, promising systems for analysis, forecast, and control of the behavior of energy facilities are those that employ innovative methods, for example, different technologies of mathematical modeling. Their successful application requires a methodological approach to build mathematical models of integrated energy systems relying on simulation modeling. The approach proposed in this paper is based on the concept of an energy hub. It has been tested on a simulation model for two energy supply channels for a fragment of a real-world energy facility. The presented methodological approach to create mathematical models of integrated energy systems is based on simulation. This approach offers broad prospects for expanding the capabilities in the design and operation of integrated multi-energy systems.

AB Park-level integrated energy systems (PIESs) have a unique role in developing communities' energy infrastruc-ture in more economical and sustainable ways. The design and operation of a PIES depend on the energy demand of buildings, which could be significantly affected by climate change. This paper presented the PIES in China's different climate zones (Harbin, Dalian, Changsha, and Haikou). The PIES integrating natural gas, solar and geothermal energy simultaneously produces electric, heating and cooling loads. A two-stage optimal approach was proposed in this paper to model the PIES mathematically. In the first stage, the worst-case scenario was obtained by the confidence interval combination method to optimize the minimum total cost. In the second stage, the operation strategies of following electric loads and following thermal loads were used to optimize the operation cost. The results revealed that the annual total cost of the PIES presented a v-shaped cost curve with the power generation unit (PGU) capacity from 400 kW to 2000 kW. PIES-1, located in Dalian, had the lowest total cost of $0.71 million. The carbon dioxide emissions had the same trend. When the PGU's capacity reached the optimum (1000 kW), the PGU's utilization rate was between 50% and 60% in all scenarios. From Harbin to Haikou, the operation cost gap between PIES-1 and PIES-2 narrowed from $0.18 million to $0.01 million. Moreover, PIES-1, located in Harbin, had the lowest CO2 emissions.

AB Integrated demand response (IDR) has been recognized as an effective approach to alleviate supply-demand imbalance in integrated energy systems (IESs). However, complex response characteristics in demand side, including substitute effect, time-varying characteristics, and uncertainties, coupled with incomplete information, have been main obstacles to predict consumer's response behavior accurately and map out effective incentive strategies. This paper proposes an improved incentive-based IDR model based on cross-elasticity theory, behavioral economics, and multi-stage rebound theory to deal with the complex characteristics, with a recursive moving window linear regression algorithm based on maximum likelihood estimation to cope with incomplete information. Our IDR model is mathematically expressed as a bi-level stochastic optimization problem, which is transformed into an equivalent nonlinear convex optimization problem to solve it efficiently. Simulation results verify merits of our model in enhancing effectiveness of incentive strategies, accuracy of consumer behavior estimation, and capability of risk management of multi-energy aggregators (MEAs), which is conducive to decreasing total cost as well as power deviation and increasing consumer's utility.

AB Hydrogen-based multi-energy microgrids (H-MEMGs), serving as integrated energy systems incorporating hydrogen, electricity, thermal, and cooling energy, have emerged as pivotal infrastructures for accelerating energy transition and achieving carbon neutrality. This study proposes a novel low-carbon driven energy sharing framework with adaptive pricing mechanisms to address the critical need for balancing economic viability and environmental sustainability. The proposed framework establishes three key contributions: 1) A non-cooperative game-theoretic foundation enabling peer-to-peer energy transactions with carbon-embedded pricing signals, 2) A privacy-preserving coordination mechanism through a virtual energy sharing center that facilitates iterative information exchange while protecting sensitive operational data, and 3) A data-driven distributionally robust optimization model employing Wasserstein metrics and conditional value-at-risk techniques to manage renewable energy uncertainties. To ensure computational efficiency and data security, we develop a distributed algorithm based on Brouwer's fixed-point theorem that enables decentralized decision-making without compromising individual microgrid's privacy. Simulation results highlight three key advantages: a 5.04 % reduction in carbon intensity relative to conventional pricing schemes, and 6.43 % cost savings via dynamic price-responsive coordination, the data-driven distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) method exhibits outstanding out-of-sample performance and strong adaptability to uncertainty. The proposed methodology provides a scalable solution for coordinating interconnected microgrids in low-carbon energy ecosystems.

AB Because of their attractive economic and environmental benefits, integrated energy systems (IESs), especially electricity-gas coupled energy systems (EGCESs), have received great interest. In this study, to minimize carbon trading and generation costs, a model-free deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL) method is integrated into the low -carbon economic autonomous energy management system of an EGCES. Unlike previous works, this work proposes an innovative transformer-deep deterministic policy gradient (TDDPG) that combines the superior feature extraction ability of the transformer network with the strong decision-making ability of a state-of-the-art TDDPG. The proposed method is tailored to the specific energy management problem to meet the requirements of multi-dimensional and continuous control. To validate the advantages of the TDDPG, the proposed method is compared with benchmark optimization methods. The simulation results illustrate that TDDPG performs more effectively than the examined DRL approaches in terms of optimizing low-carbon and economy targets, computation efficiency, and optimization of the results. Besides, the TDDPG method achieves lower average comprehensive costs than DDPG and requires less training time for real-time energy scheduling.

AB Alongside the rapid growth of wind power installation, wind curtailment is becoming more serious in China. As a type of clean and high-energy-density secondary energy, hydrogen will play a vital role in large-scale energy storage in future low-carbon energy systems. Incorporating hydrogen energy storage into integrated energy systems is a promising way to enhance the utilization of wind power. Therefore, a bi-level optimal configuration model is proposed in which the upper-level problem aims to minimize the total configuration cost to determine the capacity of hydrogen energy storage devices, and the lower-level problem aims to minimize the operational cost considering the change in hydrogen production efficiency. Owing to the non-convex characteristic of the lower-level problem containing integer variables, the bi-level model cannot be directly converted into a singlelevel model. Hence, a data-driven surrogate algorithm is applied to solve this complex bi-level programming problem. Case studies show that the proposed method can increase the economic and environmental benefits and improve energy efficiency. Sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the influence of investment cost and carbon emission price on the results. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are verified by comparison with the particle swarm optimization algorithm.

AB In the face of the ever-increasing pressure on climate change, recent decades witnessed booming interests in the integrated energy systems (IES) consisting of intermittent renewable energy and dispatchable power sources, such as reformed gas-fed solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC). However, optimization of system design and operation is challenging due to the system complexity, inevitable couplings, and various constraints. To this end, this paper proposes a comprehensive model to describe integrated energy systems with combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP). Optimal economic performance is formulated as the objective function. Constraints are derived based on the safety and operation requirements. The problem is solved by developing a two-stage stochastic programming framework to achieve the optimized results in terms of both design and operation. The second stage concerns the operation scheduling given the operation plan and stochastic characteristics, based on which the first stage concerns the design planning to realize the prescribed CCHP capacity. Considering the computation complexity of the second stage, the stochastic characteristics are represented by selected scenarios. And to present the mutual influence of energy demands and climate conditions, the time sequence correlation among energy demands and renewable energy availability is considered in the clustering-based scenario selection technique. To solve the proposed two-stage framework, the real-coded genetic algorithm and mixed integer linear programming method are applied in the first and second stages, respectively. A case study in San Francisco is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, providing some intuitive guidance for future IES operation and system planning.

AB As the integration of renewable energy sources (RES) progresses and energy technologies advance, integrated energy systems (IES) have emerged as a practical solution for leveraging RES and balancing local demand-supply dynamics. This paper investigates the planning and optimization of operations for an electricity -hydrogen integrated energy system (EH-IES), considering degradation and multi-timescale operations of storage devices to minimize the life cycle costs. To mitigate computational challenges, the planning model adopts a Representative Time Period (RTP) framework, and a novel intertemporal operation model is developed to coordinate the operations of battery and hydrogen storage. Furthermore, we propose a two -stage approach to derive representative weeks and hours from meteorological and load data using fewer data points, ensuring chronological coherence and preserving long-term patterns to validate storage device constraints and improve planning accuracy. Case studies in southeastern China's IES verify the effectiveness of our planning approach, which lowers equivalent annual costs by 4.5% and reduces battery capacity needs by 12.8%, thereby highlighting its significant economic benefits. Additionally, numerical analyses reveal that our two -stage method surpasses conventional RTP selection techniques, delivering at least 10% less average error with an equal number of operating points.

AB The risks faced by modern energy systems are increasing, primarily caused by natural disasters. As a new form of multi-level energy complimentary utilization, integrated energy systems are attracting more and more attention for their high-efficiency and low-cost. However, due to the deep coupling relationship between systems, they are more susceptible to natural disasters, resulting in a cascading failure. To enhance the resilience of the integrated electricity-gas system, this paper proposes a failure restoration strategy after a natural disaster occurs. First, the temporal constraints of the dispatching model are considered, and the failure restoration problem is molded into a multi-period mixed-integer linear programme, aiming to recover the interrupted loads as much as possible. Second, since the uncertain output of distributed generation sources (DGs) such as wind turbines and photovoltaic systems will threat the reliability of restoration results, the robust formulation model is incorporated to cope with this problem. Third, we propose a new modeling method for radial topology constraints towards failure restoration. Moreover, the Column and Constraints Generation (C&CG) decomposition method is utilized to solve the robust model. Then, the piecewise linearization technique and the linear DistFlow equations are utilized to eliminate the nonlinear terms, providing a model that could be easily solved by an off-shelf commercial solver. The obtained results include the sequence of line/pipeline switchgear actions, the time-series dispatching results of electricity storage system, gas storage system, and the coupling devices including the gas-fired turbine, power to gas equipment. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed restoration strategy is verified by numerical simulation on a 13-6 node integrated energy system.

AB The shared energy storage system is recognized as a promising business model for the coordinated operation of integrated energy systems (IES) to improve the utilization of energy storage and the consumption of renewable energy. As the hydrogen energy gradually receives more attention, this paper constructs the structure of a hybrid hydrogen energy storage system shared by an IES alliance in a dynamic pricing mode. A bi-level optimization model for the shared hybrid hydrogen energy storage system (SHHESS) is proposed to optimize the capacity configuration decisions and the pricing strategy jointly. The upper level determines the capacity and dynamic price of SHHESS with maximum profits and the lower level obtains the optimal operation of the IES alliance minimizing the total operation costs. The proposed model is solved by an improved PSO-GA algorithm and CPLEX solver. Finally, numerical tests are conducted in different scenarios. The results show that the hybrid energy storage system improves the daily profits of SHHESS by 70.3% and 5.44%, and reduces the renewable energy curtailment by 80.93% and 48.92% respectively compared to the battery-only and hydrogen-only systems. Additionally, the daily operation cost of the IES alliance is 35.2% lower than the individual operation scenario. The proposed model confirms the feasibility and superiority of the hybrid hydrogen energy storage system in a sharing business mode.

AB Different energy systems become highly connected to provide better flexibility. However, this change poses new challenges for system management considering the diversity of demands, complexities of the energy networks, uncertainties, etc. This work develops a smart Supply-Demand Side Management method to overcome these challenges. The main objectives of this Supply-Demand Side Management framework are improving system efficiency and smoothing energy load, through flexible supply planning and dynamic pricing. Firstly, the customer response analysis method is proposed by combining the Deep Learning model and the economic model. Then, the energy network simulation model is used to coordinate the Supply-Demand Side Management strategies and the overall energy system capacity. A method is proposed to introduce the compressibility of natural gas in the management framework to offset the uncertain disturbances. Finally, a multi-objective decision method is developed to find the optimal strategy. The results of the application on a typical integrated energy system show that the proposed method can reduce the energy load fluctuation by 4%e8% under different planning horizons, and improve the system efficiency by reducing energy loss and increasing the profitability. The results also present a possibility of the development toward resilient Integrated Energy Systems by managing the buffer capacity of natural gas pipeline networks. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In recent years, the idea of green aviation and environmental protection has received increasing attention from the aviation industry. Hydrogen energy has an important role in the transition to low-carbon energy systems. To address that, this article conducts the technoeconomic analysis for the hydrogen energy system, photovoltaic energy, battery storage system, electric auxiliary power unit (APU) of aircraft, and electric vehicles (EVs) into the electrified airport energy system. Specifically, the model quantifies aircraft electrical load based on passenger' travel behavior, establishes a corresponding APU load characteristic model, and establishes an EV charging load profile based on the flight schedule and sequencing algorithm. A mixed-integer linear programming optimization method based on life cycle theory was proposed to minimize the total costs of hydrogen-integrated energy systems for airports (HIES). However, the resilience advantages of hydrogen energy concerning power failure are little explored in existing academic research. Thus, a resilience assessment method and improvement measure were proposed for HIES. Case studies have been conducted under different optimal hydrogen energy integration configurations and disaster times with resilience assessment by considering periods when the power supply capacity of the grid is insufficient. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB With the rapid development of integrated energy system (IES), it has become a trend to form multiple integrated energy systems (MIESs) in a certain region. However, there is a lack of coordination and cooperation among MIESs. This paper proposes an optimal operation model of MIESs with four cost objectives, which focuses on energy interaction among MIESs. As a non-linear and large optimization problem, it is difficult for conventional mathematical methods to solve. Hence, this paper proposes a hybrid Taguchi-compact salp swarm algorithm (TCSSA). The compact technique can save the operation memory of model. Taguchi method can improve the convergence speed and solution accuracy of model. The proposed algorithm is tested on 28 benchmark functions and applied to optimal operation of MIESs. Results demonstrate that: (1) compared with other famous algorithms, TCSSA can provide more efficient execution and better solutions. (2) The optimal operation of MIESs based on TCSSA can achieve the complementary of energy advantages, which effectively reduces the total cost of MIESs (up to 9.67%).

AB This paper proposes a configuration method for a multi-element hybrid energy storage system (MHESS) to address renewable energy fluctuations and user demand in regional integrated energy systems (RIES). To reduce the investment cost of energy storage applications in RIES, a multi-timescale capacity configuration model is formulated, containing a day-ahead power planning model to optimize the power output of energy supply equipment on the hour-level scale and a day-in power operation model that considers the power response characteristics of MHESS to smooth out renewable energy fluctuations on the minute-level scale. In addition, an active energy storage operation strategy is proposed to minimize the configuration investment of MHESS in the day-ahead planning stage. The empirical mode decomposition algorithm is employed to decompose the target power of MHESS to derive the optimal capacity configuration and power output of each energy storage unit. The simulation results indicate that the proposed method is successful in reducing the investment cost when compared to both a passive and a simple Li-ion battery method. Specifically, the proposed method reduced the investment cost by 8.8% and 183.64%, respectively. This work provides a valuable reference for RIES optimization and further exploration of the potential for MHESS development.

AB Integrated energy systems (IESs) with deep coupling of electric power and natural gas have recently attracted much attention. The issue of increasing uncertainty in both the generation and load sides of an integrated electric-natural gas system (IENGS) is a concerning problem. In this paper, a hybrid robust-stochastic optimization (RSO) framework is introduced to address the day-ahead contingency-constrained unit commitment (CCUC) problem of an IENGS equipped with promising technologies. The objective of the research is to minimize the total operation cost of the CCUC problem while ensuring system security under multiple uncertainties and contingencies. The uncertainties of load and gas demands are generated using the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method, while a robust uncertainty set is applied to handle wind power deviations. Generation scheduling and topology control action are also co-optimized. To solve the proposed CCUC as a nonconvex problem, an augmented nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm is used to enhance the performance of the decomposition procedure. The quantitative results imply that with a negligible increase of 6.88% in operation cost, a huge cost reduction of 38.06% in the long run model can be anticipated. Additionally, the results show the effectiveness of the TLS action in day-ahead operation, reducing the total cost by up to 17.5%.

AB Comprehensive performance evaluation is a fundamental part of the design and operation optimization of distributed integrated energy systems (IES), and the evaluation is currently focused on three types of elements: economic, energy efficiency and environmental protection. In this paper, energy use quality elements are proposed from the high energy supply requirements of users for distributed IES and characterized by the supply-demand imbalance rate indicator. Then the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the information entropy method are combined to form a combined evaluation method by weighing the subjective and objective methods. The comprehensive performance evaluation of distributed IES with nine indicators considering four elements of economy, energy efficiency, environmental protection and energy use quality is realized. The feasibility and validity of the proposed indicators and the difference between the proposed combination method and the existing combination method are verified by the calculation examples. In the single-objective optimization with optimal energy use quality, the supply-demand imbalance rates for heat and cold are -0.05 and -0.035, respectively, which are the best among the five optimization schemes and fully guarantee the stability and quality of energy supply. However, its CO2 emission of 5738.91 (t/year) shows that this indicator is not suitable for the limitation of single-objective optimization, and it would be more suitable for comprehensive optimization with the above three indicators. The weights of operation cost, heat and cold supply-demand imbalance in the AHP method are 0.2247,0.0539,0.0539. The corresponding weights in the information entropy method are 0.0930,0.1670,0.1864. The corrected values are 0.1999, 0.0861, 0.0961. The results show the corrective effect of the information entropy method on the AHP. In addition, the combination method proposed in this paper corrects the configuration cost term to 0.2032, which is larger than both 0.1588 in the AHP method and 0.1388 in the information entropy method, highlighting the difference from existing combination methods. The above data show that the comprehensive evaluation by the AHP-information entropy method can effectively consider the four elements' role. It provides a new idea for the research on the impact of distributed IES energy storage on the energy use quality of the system and the construction and operation optimization of the comprehensive performance evaluation indicator of the system.

ID DEMAND RESPONSE; ELECTRICITY; SYSTEMS
AB With the increasing development of integrated energy systems and the continuous promotion of integrated demand response (IDR) research, residential users with a large amount of demand response resources are drawing more and more widespread attention. In order to fully exploit the IDR potential of residential users and analyse the influence of user comfort and consumer psychology (UCCP) on IDR, the optimised operation study of load aggregator (LA) based on UCCP-IDR model is proposed. Firstly, a self-organising map algorithm for clustering is introduced, from which various types of users with differentiated consumption psychology are obtained. Secondly, user comfort and consumption psychology are taken into account to establish a user curtailable, shiftable and transformable load model. Thirdly, the user IDR optimisation model is established based on the load model considering the user response uncertainty. Finally, based on the optimisation strategy of user IDR, the total energy demand of LA is obtained, and thus the optimal operation model of LA equipment is established. The analysis shows that the proposed strategy can provide a more reliable and targeted integrated demand response strategy for residential users, and achieve a win-win situation for both LA and residential users.

AB With the transformation from individual energy systems to integrated energy systems (IES), equivalent circuit IES modeling is developed to represent the heat and electricity consistently for coordinated analysis, control and optimization. However, physical properties of equivalent parameters are a mismatch, and the key operation characteristics, including dynamics and coupling, have not yet been fully described, remaining obstacles for optimal electricity-heat coordination. In this study, a novel IES equivalent circuit modeling methodology is proposed. From the perspective of physical characteristics, the similarity of heat transfer and micro conductivity processes is determined. A novel thermoelectric equivalent rule with matched energy units is proposed, showing the corresponding relations of the basic state, power, and energy quantities between electricity and heat. Then, the equivalent rule is applied in IES equivalent circuit modeling, where the equivalent heat element models are established to characterize the electrothermal coupling and dynamics of heat subsystems. Finally, following the IES system structure, the IES equivalent circuit model is completed. A numerical comparison is performed to verify the effectiveness of the model. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model can fully capture the dynamic and coupling characteristics of IES.

AB To improve the accuracy of short-term multi-energy load prediction models for integrated energy systems, the historical development law of the multi-energy loads must be considered. Moreover, understanding the complex coupling correlation of the different loads in the multi-energy systems, and accounting for other load-influencing factors such as weather, may further improve the forecasting performance of such models. In this study, a two-stage fuzzy optimization method is proposed for the feature selection and identification of the multi-energy loads. To enrich the information content of the prediction input feature, we introduced a copula correlation feature analysis in the proposed framework, which extracts the complex dynamic coupling correlation of multi-energy loads and applies Akaike information criterion (AIC) to evaluate the adaptability of the different copula models presented. Furthermore, we combined a NARX neural network with Bayesian optimization and an extreme learning machine model optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA) to effectively improve the feature fusion performances of the proposed multi-energy load prediction model. The effectiveness of the proposed short-term prediction model was confirmed by the experimental results obtained using the multi-energy load time-series data of an actual integrated energy system.

AB Energy hubs (EHs) are deployed to supply multi-energy demands economically in the integrated energy systems while considering physical and operational constraints of individual energy systems. This paper presents a decentral framework for the optimal dispatch of integrated power distribution and natural gas system (IDGS) in networked energy hubs. The IDGS operator (IDGSO) is charged with delivering a constrained optimal dispatch while preserving the privacy of participants' data. First, a comprehensive optimization model is proposed in this paper using the mixed-integer second-order cone programming and sequential second-order cone (SOC) algorithms to guarantee the exactness of SOC relaxation. In this optimization process, we consider advanced control methods, such as remotely controlled switches and static var compensators, and propose two improvements including initial point setting and a special type of cutting plane to obtain a fast and feasible solution. Next, we apply Benders decomposition for decentralizing the decision-making process in accordance with the practical leader-follower relationship between IDGSO and EHOs (EH operators) and preserving private operation data of individual EHOs.

AB To realize the national strategies for carbon emission reduction, electric power industries should undergo reforms to cope with the multiple challenges of decarbonization, marketization, and energy transition. How to design a dispatch strategy that considers both low-carbon demand and economic cost has become a major concern in integrated energy systems. To realize multi-energy complementation and low-carbonization, a scheduling framework of combined heat and power-virtual power plants (CHP-VPPs) considering carbon capture and power-to-gas is proposed. The stochastic dynamic optimization problem is modelled as a Markov decision process. An improved deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm named multi-level backtracking prioritized experience replay-twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (MBEPR-TD3) is employed to solve the low-carbon economic dispatch problem. The results show that: (1) The profits have been increased by 85.8% and carbon emissions have been reduced by 30.3% because of the addition of power-to-gas in CHP-VPP; (2) the revenues have been improved by 22.24% and carbon emissions have been decreased by 37.04% owing to the introduction of carbon capture and trading; (3) compared with results using DQN, DDPG, and TD3, the optimal dispatch strategy obtained by MBEPR-TD3 has higher reward returns and more stable convergence.

AB Developing hydrogen-integrated energy systems (HIES) represents a cutting-edge strategy for harnessing renewable energy (RE). However, the inherent unpredictability and variability of RE significantly increase the operational uncertainty of HIES, which leads to severe energy curtailment issues when HIES integrates largescale RE, necessitating greater operational flexibility in the system. To address the challenges, this paper proposes a fuzzy optimal scheduling approach for HIES that considers the hydrogen equipment under multiple operating conditions. The analysis begins by examining the operational mechanisms of hydrogen equipment. Subsequently, a multi-conditions model is developed for electrolyzers, while a reserve model is established for hydrogen fuel cells. Furthermore, the fuzzy chance constraint (FCC) is employed to quantify the uncertainty of RE generation. An integrated demand response mechanism is implemented, incorporating human thermal comfort and building thermal inertia. Finally, a fuzzy optimization scheduling model for HIES is constructed to minimize the total operating costs. The crisp equivalent of FCC is derived to solve this model, thereby transforming the scheduling model based on fuzzy chance-constrained programming into a solvable mixed-integer programming model. The simulation results indicate that the proposed scheduling method can reduce the overall costs of the HIES by 17.98 % and increase the RE accommodation rate by 19.67 %, validating the effectiveness of the method in enhancing the operational flexibility of the HIES. In addition, this study achieves a balance between economic efficiency and reliability, offering a better economy, lower energy curtailment rates, and faster decision-making times compared to robust optimization, scenario analysis, and other common fuzzy optimization methods.

AB The study presents the sizing of a hybrid renewable islanded system that can feed both electrical and thermal energy simultaneously. The aforementioned energies are generated through the utilization of wind systems and bio-waste units. The integration of combined heat and power technology in the bio-waste unit enables the concurrent generation of electricity and heat power. Electric vehicles consume electric energy, but function based on a smart charging. The study employs compressed air energy storage as a means to bridge the disparity between the patterns of electric power generation and consumption, with the aim of enhancing energy efficiency and reducing planning expenses. Thermal energy storage serves as an intermediary between renewable power and load profiles within the thermal sector. Objective here is find the minimum annual capital and maintenance costs of sources, storages, and power electronic converters. Problem is constrained to operational model of renewable sources, storages, and electric vehicles. The present model prioritizes the utilization of renewable sources for the purpose of supplying electrical and thermal loads. Electric vehicles regulate their active power to minimize the disparity between load and electric production profiles. Storages perform charging and discharging functions to bridge the disparity between power generation and consumption. Strategy incorporates uncertainty related to load, wind speed, bio-waste-derived gas production, and electric vehicles parameters. The study employs a point estimate method to attain a dependable solution. The numerical results indicate that incorpo-ration of compressed air storage in the hybrid system results in a decrease of 7.7 % (12.9 %) in the planning costs relative to system with batteries (hydrogen storage). The proposed design's concurrent provision of electrical and thermal energy leads to an approximately 57 % increasing in planning costs when compared to a system that solely provides electrical energy. The implementation of a smart charging strategy for electric vehicles drop the hybrid system's overall scheduling cost by 3.9 %.

AB This work introduces an optimization approach for the design and operation of integrated energy systems of residential structures and light industrial plants to minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions going beyond the best possible results from standalone systems. Unlike previous studies, in this work, heat transfer considers temperatures of heat sources and receptors; production rates of plants are optimized to maximize GHG emissions reduction of the integrated operation. Results from case studies indicate if temperature levels are not considered, more than 33% of deemed heat transfer is infeasible. Operating the integrated plants at a steady daily production rate brings a significant reduction in GHG emissions for systems accessing the northeast U.S. grid. Further reduction of GHG emissions is accomplished by scheduling the production rate. Schedules with at most one daily production rate change have only 0.4% higher GHG emissions than the optimum, which has frequent production rate changes. When the standalone system and integrated system have the same annual total cost, the integrated system reduces GHG emissions by at least 18.8% and reduces electricity purchases by 66%. Therefore, the integrated operation can reduce GHG emissions of the system, where the maximum reduction is achieved by optimizing the design and operation of energy system equipment, considering the temperature of heating demands, and optimizing production rates of plants with constraints applied to changes of the rates.

AB Exergy analysis is a unified approach to evaluating the quantity and quality of energy in integrated energy systems (IESs). However, exergy analysis models have been relatively underexplored for IES operation in energy transmission networks. This study addresses this gap by developing an input-benefit exergy model and an exergy loss calculation model for each link within heat-and-electricity-based IESs (HE-IESs), encompassing the transmission networks. Then, an exergy-based unified optimal operation model for HE-IESs is introduced by minimizing the total exergy loss of the system. In addition, the effect of load rate on the energy efficiency of energy conversion equipment is considered. By applying piecewise linearization to the non-convex terms in the objective function and the equality constraints, the proposed optimization model is accurately and efficiently analyzed as a mixed-integer second-order cone programming problem. The case study results demonstrate that the proposed model reduces equipment-related exergy loss, with approximately 3.2 times the heat network-related exergy loss. Moreover, the average deviation gaps of the overall system's exergy loss and equipment's output exergy power between the proposed and the existing models reach 12.94% and 27.83%, respectively. The maximum relative error of the solution results with the proposed linearization method remains below 1.2%, satisfying the requirements of practical application.

AB Under a multi-energy environment, the conventional demand response programmes in smart-grid will be evolving to the concept of integrated demand response (IDR). In order to examine such an effect, this study presents a new methodological framework to conduct the probabilistic energy flow (PEF) analysis of integrated energy systems, while considering the potential effects of IDR. For this aim, a new price-elasticity-based IDR model is developed. As distinct from existing works, this study explicitly focuses on the stochastic characteristics of IDR programme and a novel Z-number-based technique is introduced to handle the relevant uncertainties that involved. The proposed Z-number model can not only capture the inherent randomness in demand-side performance but also account for the potential impact of information availability/reliability on the representation of IDR. Since the presence of Z-numbers makes the authors model include different types of uncertain representations, the fuzzy expectation technique and centroid method are jointly used to make them manageable under the same framework. A comprehensive algorithm based on the cumulant method and an optimisation scheme is employed to solve this PEF problem with consideration of IDR. The proposed framework is illustrated through numerical studies and simulation results confirm its effectiveness in actual implementations.

AB EMU stands for electric multiple units and refers to a train of self-propelled cars pushed by electricity. Energy from renewable sources such as solar and wind can be stored in battery storage systems (BESS) and released when consumers need it most. Electric traction motors are built inside one or more of the carriages of an EMU, eliminating the need for a separate engine. Electric trains can go further and quicker than those propelled by steam engines. There are several advantages to using electric trains, such as efficiently converting fuel into kinetic energy. Rail travel is affected by fluctuations in electrical power. With AI, energy waste and prices might be reduced, and the deployment of clean, renewable energy sources could be facilitated and accelerated in power systems globally. Artificial intelligence (AI) can benefit from the design, operation, and management of power systems. Voltage fluctuations occur if a large number of electricity gadgets are utilized simultaneously. Voltage fluctuations, especially in extreme circumstances, can be extremely hazardous to the safety and other possessions. The researchers devised the EMU-AI-BESS approach to address these problems. Trains powered by lithiumion batteries can go on both kinds of track. Battery-electric technology has been used to expand electrified metro lines in several cities throughout the globe, and many more are contemplating it. Renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydrogen can be effectively managed and distributed due to smart grid technologies. The smart grid links a wide range of distributed energy resources to the power grid.AI can assist in minimizing traffic congestion, detecting dangers, managing transportation, analyzing travel demand, and potentially cutting greenhouse gas emissions. AI is being utilized in today's rail applications to increase asset management and train schedules, train speed control, and other factors. AI's primary goal is to give computers to execute mental functions, including decisionmaking, problem-solving, perception, and communication comprehension. Artificial intelligence will be needed to manage decentralized grids as the world transitions to renewable energy. Using AI, power supply and demand can be balanced in real-time, optimizing energy consumption and storage to minimize rates.(c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Photovoltaic (PV) power prediction plays a significant role in supporting the stable operation and resource scheduling of integrated energy systems. However, the randomness and volatility of photovoltaic power generation will greatly affect the prediction accuracy. Focusing on this issue, a prediction framework is proposed in this research by developing an improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA) to optimize the hyperparameters of long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. The ISSA is specially designed from the following three aspects to support a powerful search performance. Firstly, the initial population variety is enriched by using an enhanced sine chaotic mapping. Secondly, the relative position of neighboring producers is introduced to improve the producer position-updating strategy to enhance the global search capabilities. Then the Cauchy-Gaussian variation is utilized to help avoid the local optimal solution. Numerical experiments on 20 test functions indicate that ISSA could identify the optimal solution with better precision compared to SSA and PSO algorithms. Furthermore, a comparative study of PV power prediction methods is provided. The ISSA-LSTM algorithm developed in this paper and five benchmark models are implemented on a real dataset gathered from the Alice Springs area in Australia. In contrast to the SSA-LSTM model, most MAE, MAPE, and RMSE values of the proposed model are reduced by 20 similar to 60%, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed model under various weather conditions and typical seasons.

   The tool proposed in this work was conceived in order to serve as a preliminary instrument to size multi-energy rural energy systems, in the context of reaching universal access to energy as part of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7). In addition to its main purpose, we believe this tool might be of interest in the study of integrated smart energy districts and in general integrated energy systems with high penetration of renewables, where the interaction among different kinds of energy demands is considered.
   Energy system models for off-grid systems usually tend to focus solely on the provision of electricity for powering simple appliances, thus neglecting more energy-intensive and critical needs, such as water heating. The adoption of a Multi-Energy System (MES) perspective would allow us not only to provide comprehensive solutions addressing all types of energy demand, but also to exploit synergies between the electric and thermal sectors. To this end, we expand an existing open-source micro-grid optimization model with a complementary thermal model. Results show how the latter achieves optimal solutions that are otherwise restricted, allowing for a reduction in the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) of 59% compared to a conventional microgrid, and an increase of reliance on renewable sources of 70%.

AB Decentralized trading schemes involving energy prosumers have prevailed in recent years. Such schemes provide a pathway for increased energy efficiency and can be enhanced by the use of blockchain technology to address security concerns in decentralized trading. To improve transaction security and privacy protection while ensuring desirable social governance, this article proposes a novel two-stage blockchain-based operation and trading mechanism to enhance energy hubs connected with integrated energy systems (IESs). This mechanism includes multienergy aggregators (MAGs) that use a consortium blockchain and its enabled proof-of-work (PoW) to transfer and audit transaction records, with social governance principles for guiding prosumers' decision-making in the peer-to-peer (P2P) transaction management process. The uncertain nature of renewable generation and load demand are adequately modeled in the two-stage Wasserstein-based distributionally robust optimization (DRO). The practicality of the proposed mechanism is illustrated by several case studies that jointly show its ability to handle an increased renewable generation capacity, achieve a 16.7% saving in the audit cost, and facilitate 2.4% more P2P interactions. Overall, the proposed two-stage blockchainbased trading mechanism provides a practical trading scheme and can reduce redundant trading amounts by 6.5%, leading to a further reduction of the overall operation cost. Compared to the state-of-the-art benchmark methods, our mechanism exhibits significant operation cost reduction and ensures social governance and transaction security for IES and energy hubs.

AB The electricity consumption of the textile industry accounts for 2.12% of the total electricity consumption in society, making it one of the high-energy-consuming industries in China. The textile industry requires the use of a large amount of industrial steam at various temperatures during production processes, making its dispatch and operation more complex compared to conventional electricity-heat integrated energy systems. As an important demand-side management platform connecting the grid with distributed resources, a virtual power plant can aggregate textile industry users through an operator, regulating their energy consumption behavior and enhancing demand-side management efficiency. To effectively address the challenges in load regulation for textile industry users, this paper proposes a coordinated optimization dispatching method for electricity-steam virtual-based power plants focused on textile industrial parks. On one hand, targeting the impact of different energy prices on the energy usage behavior of textile industry users, an optimization dispatching model is established where the upper level consists of virtual power plant operators setting energy prices, and the lower level involves multiple textile industry users adjusting their purchase and sale strategies and changing their own energy usage behaviors accordingly. On the other hand, taking into account the energy consumption characteristics of steam, it is possible to optimize the production and storage behaviors of textile industry users during off-peak electricity periods in the power market. Through this electricity-steam optimization dispatching model, the virtual power plant operator's revenue is maximized while the operating costs for textile industry users are minimized. Case study analyses demonstrate that this strategy can effectively enhance the overall economic benefits of the virtual power plant.

AB Integrated Energy Systems (IES) can effectively promote the utilization of renewable energy. Reducing the impact of uncertainties and achieving energy supply-demand balance has always been a key issue in energy scheduling. However, existing research often focuses only on energy prices when designing demand response strategies, neglecting user response characteristics, particularly the influence of environmental temperature and user consumption levels. Therefore, this paper proposes an IES optimization scheduling model that considers user load response characteristics, analyzing changes in user response loads under different environmental and consumption levels. Additionally, consumption levels and environmental parameters are introduced to build an interactive response model. Different incentive measures are designed based on load types to guide users in adjusting their electricity usage behavior, optimizing the supply-demand curve. Furthermore, to address source-load uncertainties, a two-stage robust optimization model is constructed and solved iteratively using the column-and-constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm. The results indicate that considering user response characteristics reduces the peak-to-valley differences in electrical, thermal, and cooling loads by 18.6%, 7.0%, and 13.3% respectively, and reduces total costs by 8.9%. This model can ensure reliable operation while improving the economic efficiency of the system.

ID GENERATION
AB The optimal allocation of energy storage capacity is an important issue for integrated energy systems (IES). To reduce the impact of volatility and intermittency of renewable energy sources, the impact of volatility needs to be smoothed out by rational allocation of energy storage. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a method for the optimal allocation of source storage capacity considering integrated demand response(IDR). Firstly, the basic mechanism of IES based on energy hub(EH) is constructed, and the model and coupling relationship of equipment components in the system are introduced. The IDR model is built to optimize the load curve according to the real-time market tariff scheme, and then the confidence interval method is used to analyze the scenery uncertainty in IES and determine the scenery output curve under different confidence levels. On this basis, a bi-level optimization model is built that takes into account both source and storage capacity allocation and operational optimization. The upper-level planning model takes into account the uncertainty of wind power and photovoltaic output, and solves the allocation scheme of energy storage intending to minimize the total planning cost; the lower-level operation optimization model takes into account the output constraints of each unit and optimizes the output of the equipment to minimize the operation cost. Finally, it is verified that considering IDR can reasonably optimize the allocation of the system's source storage capacity and reduce the system's investment and operating costs.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Integrated energy systems within communities play a pivotal role in addressing the diverse energy requirements of the system, emerging as a central focus in contemporary research. This paper contributes to exploring optimal scheduling in a smart community featuring multiple smart buildings equipped with a substantial share of distributed photovoltaic sources, shared energy storage, and controllable loads. The study formulates a two-stage scheduling optimization model incorporating multiple stakeholders, explicitly examining the game dynamics between the smart community operator and the customer load aggregator. The weights assigned to each optimization objective are determined using an analytic hierarchy process-entropy weight method to establish a balanced and nuanced approach. The ensuing optimal scheduling encompasses unit output and energy trading considerations, focusing on enhancing the system's economic viability, safety measures, and environmental sustainability. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted to validate the proposed model by comparing its performance with alternative operational strategies. The results show that the designed strategy can reduce the operating cost by 40.22% and increase the level of PV consumption by 22.57% compared to the traditional heatbased strategy, which is effective in mitigating power fluctuations, smartly responding to dispatch peak demand, enhancing new energy integration, and ensuring the security of grid operation.

AB Solar-powered integrated energy systems (IES) play a pivotal role in the global transition towards cleaner energy structures. Optimal design of such systems remains a significant research challenge, particularly in the context of diverse energy sources, multi-objectives, and the impact of uncertainties. In this paper, a novel framework for optimal design of IES is proposed with consideration of multiple objectives, stochastic variation of solar radiation, and the long timescale operational characteristics. A multi-stage hierarchical contraction algorithm is proposed to decouple the optimal scheduling from optimal sizing problem. The setting of multi-stage and hierarchical contraction ensure the optimization performance while mitigate the computational burden. Additionally, a stochastic radiation generation model is proposed based on the clearness index and daily clearness states. The model generates radiation data that considers both the stochastic variability in intra-day radiation intensity and the evolution characteristic of daily radiation intensity. The performance of optimal-sized systems obtained under different methods are compared through full lifespan simulation analysis. The result of the proposed long-timescale-based optimization framework has lower cost of energy over system lifecycle. Meanwhile, it improves the reliability of cooling and hydrogen energy supply by 5.7 % and 0.23 %, respectively, while maintaining robust grid interaction performance.

AB Operational evaluation is critical for revealing the operational performance and improvement potential of community integrated energy systems (CIESs). However, complex system configuration and flexible energy conversion in a CIES render the evaluation more challenging. Both the loss in energy quality and quantity should be considered to comprehensively evaluate the energy utilization capability of a CIES. Accurately quantified evaluation requires the optimal solution as the reference, which incurs a heavy computational burden and limits its applicability under massive scenarios. This paper proposes a surrogate model assisted quantified evaluation method for CIES operation considering the variation in energy quality and to show the gap to optimal performance. First, exergy theory is adopted to analyze the matching degree between the input and output energy quality. Second, three indicators are considered as examples to reveal the operational performance in terms of system efficiency, renewable energy penetration, and operation cost. The scores of quantified evaluation are derived using the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) method. Third, a CNN-based surrogate model is designed to replace the time-consuming optimization problems for the optimal reference solution, which effectively accelerates the evaluation efficiency under massive scenarios. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the evaluation methods and efficiency of the proposed surrogate model.

AB Renewable energy is pivotal in the process of industrial decarbonization, with hydrogen recognized as a highly available and clean energy source. However, achieving a full-scale hydrogen economy necessitates large-scale storage. As such, storage in salt formations, known for its superior peak shaving capabilities, is considered a potential solution. Given the variability of layered salt formations, this review offers a critical synthesis of the technical characteristics and challenges in the field of Salt cavern hydrogen storage, including hydrogen loss, site selection, and safety evaluation. The proposed site selection criteria demand higher requirements for the sealing integrity of the rock formations and recommend conducting hydrogen storage potential assessments. The safety evaluation system presented includes 15 indicators, emphasizing the impact of hydrogen permeation on the stability of salt pillars. Additionally, the review discussed the potential and challenges of developing integrated energy systems incorporating salt cavern hydrogen storage, proposing an operational framework for integrated energy systems that accounts for constraints,site selection, and system operation optimization. Lastly, conclusions and recommendations for future research are presented. This review offers insights for future work and is expected to contribute to the advancement of sustainable energy solutions.

AB In order to improve the insulation design of future gaseous helium (GHe) insulated pipelines for integrated energy systems, this paper proposes a new concept with the application of the E-field adaptive insulator in dc GHe-insulated pipeline. By designing a reasonable spatial conductivity profile of the insulator, the E-field distribution can be significantly improved. As the iteration step increases in the optimization procedure, the E-field distribution becomes increasingly uniform along the insulator surface. However, the grown leakage current caused by higher volume conductivity should not he ignored. In practical application, a balance point must be found between the E-field distribution and leakage current. For the insulator proposed in this paper, the superior E-field nonuniformity factor is 1.1.

AB Green energy is driving the evolutions of energy industry and carbon emission is becoming an important concern. Considering the increasing couplings among various energy sectors, this paper investigates multi-period optimal energy flow and energy pricing in carbon-emission embedded integrated energy systems, including electricity, natural gas, and district heating networks. Firstly, an optimal scheduling model of integrated energy systems was proposed in this paper. The models of DC power flow, natural gas pipeline flow and heating network energy flow are presented and linearized for the optimization problem. Natural gas-fired generators and combined heat and power (CHP) units are modeled as coupling components of electricity gas and electricity-heating networks. Then, based on the optimal scheduling model, the locational marginal prices (LMP) for electricity, natural gas and heating network are determined. Moreover, the carbon emission caused by energy production has been taken into account in the optimal scheduling and energy pricing process. Finally, case studies on a combined network consisting of IEEE 39-bus system, Belgium 20-node natural gas system and 6-node heating system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the impacts of carbon emission on system scheduling and LMP.

AB The uncertainty of renewable energy has brought challenges to the real-time dispatch of integrated energy systems (IES). Nowadays, reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used in IES real-time dispatch to deal with the uncertainty of renewable energy. However, traditional RL algorithms often face the problem of dimensionality when there are numerous controllable units in the system, which will increase operating costs and training time significantly. Based on the above issues, we developed a novel real-time dispatch method for IES with RL model training in stages based on the dueling double deep quality network (D3QN). Dispatches of different controllable units in IES are decomposed into a multi-stage training process according to the degree of thermoelectric coupling and the complexity of equipment operation. This makes the action space of each training stage inde- pendent, alleviating the problem of extra-large action space in the traditional RL method. In addition, an improved action-choosing strategy is proposed to enhance local optimization in the process of algorithm training by introducing "offset" according to probability in the training progress. The simulations were carried out on four different types of days in an IES. The results show that the proposed method can effectively reduce operating costs and accelerate convergence.

AB The design of user-level integrated energy systems is challenged by a variety of combinations of energy converters, complex cascade utilization of multiple energy flows, as well as sequential matching between stochastic energy resources and periodic energy demands. These issues can be addressed by an optimal energy hub based planning framework considering the synergistic effects under multiple uncertainties. The energy hub model is extended to analyze energy-level matching and source-load balance with time-varying coupling factors representing part-load characteristics. The optimization problem is formulated as a bi-level planning model with uncertainties evaluated by a two-stage global sensitivity analysis. The bi-level planning model determines the system structure and component sizing at the upper level and identifies the optimal operation strategy at the lower level by employing piecewise linearization of part-load characteristics of components involved. The global sensitivity analysis reduces model size with the elementary effect method, identifies the most influential uncertain parameters with a variance-based method. A case study in Beijing is demonstrated for the proposed methodology. The results show that the proposed method can effectively plan the integrated energy system considering sequential source-load matching with the rational scheduling strategy of components. The demand-side response influences the system configuration and renewable energy penetration. Integrating the components' part-load characteristics help avoid the mismatch between the component capacity and energy demand, reducing 6.8% cost compared to the scheme with constant energy efficiency. The three most influential factors identified among 551 uncertain parameters are natural gas price, valley electricity price and nominal efficiency of the gas turbine.

AB The periodic outage planning of generation units for maintenance services is critical for their economic operation. Ignoring it can lead to premature degradation, high repair costs, and system reliability deterioration due to unexpected outages. Accordingly, generation maintenance scheduling (GMS) can optimally handle this challenge. In a power system with combined heat and power (CHP), although CHP units can efficiently supply power and heat demand, continuous operation of such units can cause an increase in unexpected failure rate and repair costs. Accordingly, this research accomplishes GMS coordination in CHP-integrated energy systems to optimally determine the maintenance plan of units. Firstly, the yearly GMS is planned and then the short-term generation scheduling is optimized. The proposed GMS problem is modeled as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem while considering the technical constraints, CHP feasible operation region, and power and heat balance. Moreover, the uncertainty in the market price is considered and the CVaR measure is employed to deal with the risks in the GMS. Furthermore, demand response is also assumed in the short-term generation scheduling while evaluating the impact of the yearly GMS. Numerical simulations with scenario-based optimization are used to evaluate the proposed CHP GMS problem with uncertainty in market price.

AB Integrated energy systems (IESs), in which various energy flows are interconnected and coordinated to release potential flexibility for more efficient and secure operation, have drawn increasing attention in recent years. In this article, an integrated energy management system (IEMS) that performs online analysis and optimization on coupling energy flows in an IES is comprehensively introduced. From the theory perspective, an energy circuit method (ECM) that models natural gas networks and heating networks in the frequency domain is discussed. This method extends the electric circuit modeling of power systems to IESs and enables the IEMS to manage large-scale IESs. From the implementation perspective, the architecture design and function development of the IEMS are presented. Tutorial examples with illustrative case studies are provided to demonstrate its functions of dynamic state estimation, energy flow analysis, security assessment and control, and optimal energy flow. From the application perspective, real-world engineering demonstrations that apply IEMSs in managing building-, park-, and city-scale IESs are reported. The economic and environmental benefits obtained in these demonstration projects indicate that the IEMS has broad application prospects for a low/zero-carbon future energy system.

AB As the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in distribution network, the tie-line power fluctuation caused by intermittent renewable energy produces a detrimental impact on security and reliability of the main grid. Therefore, maximization of renewable energy utilization as well as stabilization of tie-line power fluctuation are both required in the distribution network, to ease the power regulation burden of main grid. Remarkably, the development of integrated energy systems makes it possible to transfer the fluctuation in power network to other larger inertial systems. This paper proposes a coordinated operation strategy for the gas electricity integrated distribution system, considering AC power flow in the power network and the gas hydraulic calculation in gas network. In addition, based on the nonlinear multi-energy coupling external characteristics modeling of CCHP system, the power fluctuation of renewable energy sources is transferred to gas distribution network and cooling or heating system by coordinated operation of Multi-CCHPs. Moreover, a two-stage optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the corresponding mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. The simulations conducted on 33-node power distribution network and 24-node gas network show that the proposed method can effectively smooth the tie-line power fluctuation in variety case.

AB In order to balance the interests of integrated energy operator (IEO) and users, a novel Stackelberg game-based optimization framework is proposed for the optimal scheduling of integrated demand response (IDR)-enabled integrated energy systems with uncertain renewable generations, where the IEO acts as the leader who pursues the maximization of his profits by setting energy prices, while the users are the follower who adjusts energy consumption plans to minimize their energy costs. Taking into account the inherent uncertainty of renewable generations, the probabilistic spinning reserve is written in the form of a chance constraint; in addition, a district heating network model is built considering the characteristics of time delay and thermal attenuation by fully exploiting its potential, and the flexible thermal comfort requirements of users in IDR are considered by introducing a predicted mean vote (PMV) index. To solve the raised model, sequence operation theory is introduced to convert the chance constraint into its deterministic equivalent form, and thereby, the leader?follower Stackelberg game is tackled into a mixed-integer quadratic programming formulation through Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions and is finally solved by the CPLEX optimizer. The results of two case studies demonstrate that the proposed Stackelberg game-based approach manages to achieve the Stackelberg equilibrium between IEO and users by the coordination of renewable generations and IDR. Furthermore, the study on a real integrated energy system in China verifies the applicability of the proposed approach for real-world applications.

AB Multi-District Integrated Energy Systems play a crucial role in achieving decarbonization goals and enhancing renewable energy utilization. However, the inherent uncertainties in source-load side and market fluctuations pose significant challenges for stable energy management and fair market participation. To address these issues, this study presents a decarbonization-oriented and uncertainty-aware energy management strategy, integrating a Newton-Raphson-Based Optimizer-enhanced Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise clustering algorithm, an enhanced Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers optimization framework, and an Asymmetric Nash Bargaining model for Fair Peer-to-Peer Trading. The proposed Newton-Raphson-Based Optimizer-enhanced Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise dynamically optimizes clustering parameters, reducing scenario Root Mean Square Error by 40 % compared to baseline Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise. The enhanced Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers solver accelerates system convergence by 50 %, enabling real-time scheduling optimization. Furthermore, the fairness-aware Asymmetric Nash Bargaining model incorporates carbon emissions, demand-side response, and prosumer contributions, ensuring equitable revenue allocation while reducing carbon emissions by 51.4 % and system costs by 18.5 %. The findings demonstrate that decarbonization-oriented and uncertainty-aware energy management strategy offers a robust and scalable solution for the next generation of sustainable energy markets, supporting both carbon neutrality and economic efficiency.

AB Micro-energy networks are the smallest element of integrated energy systems, and tapping into the integrated demand response potential of micro-energy networks is conducive to improving energy use efficiency and promoting the development of new energy sources on a large scale. This paper proposes a day-ahead integrated demand response strategy for micro-energy grid that takes into account the dispatchable loads. Considering the gradient use of thermal energy, a typical micro-energy grid structure including electricity, gas, medium-grade heat, low-grade heat, and cold energy is constructed, a comprehensive energy equipment model is established, and the refined scheduling models of the dispatchable loads are given. On this basis, with the operating economy of the micro-energy grid as the optimization objective, the integrated demand response strategies of tariff-type and incentive-type are proposed. Through case study analysis, it is verified that the proposed strategy can optimize the energy consumption structure of the micro-energy grid under the guidance of time-of-use tariffs, reducing the operating costs. The proposed strategy fully exploits the demand response potential of the micro-energy grid through the dispatchable loads and the multi-energy complementarity of electricity, heat, and cold, realizes the comprehensive coordination and optimization of source-network-load-storage, provides a larger peak-regulating capacity, and exhibits practical applicability in engineering.

AB The integration of thermal and electrical systems offers potential for exchanging system services. Studies of integrated energy systems typically represent the system quasi-statically, and use implicit control schemes, e.g. through optimisation formulations. However, properly characterising services offered between these systems and their cross-domain impact, requires both modelling these systems at time-scales congruent with operation, and explicitly modelling their control flow. By modelling both domainand control systems explicitly, we show how a co-simulation tool-chain allows examining the impact of flexibility provision in one domain on another, as well as evaluating cross-domain control strategies. We further examine the impact time resolution has on the perceived benefit of cross-domain service provision, specifically whether quasi-static studies lead to systematic overor under-estimation of the benefits from cross-domain integration.

AB Multi-energy load forecasting forms the foundation of the operation and scheduling of integrated energy systems. Nevertheless, insufficient data and underutilization of the coupling relationship between the multi-energy load limit the accuracy of load forecasting. This paper presents a predictive model combining neural network Gaussian processes and multi-task learning. The approach is tailored to enhance forecasting accuracy in environments with small-sample datasets. This model capitalizes on the advantageous properties of infinitely wide neural networks for handling small-sample data. Simultaneously, the model effectively extracts the interconnected dynamics of cooling, heating, and electricity loads within the integrated energy system through multitask learning. In addition, the model applies concrete dropout, enhancing robustness to irregular loads while maintaining the synergistic benefits of the multi-task framework. Furthermore, this paper employs a two-stage gradient descent approach to replace kernel matrix computations of Gaussian processes, reducing the computational cost of parameter optimization and yielding superior forecasting performance in shorter training durations. The simulation results indicate that the proposed model attains a mean accuracy of 97.93% for a 3-day forecasting horizon. Compared with alternative forecasting models, this model exhibits higher accuracy and enhanced generalization capabilities in multi-energy load forecasting for small-sample integrated energy systems.

AB With the promotion of renewable energy utilization and the trend of a low-carbon society, the real-life application of photovoltaic (PV) combined with battery energy storage systems (BESS) has thrived recently. Cost-benefit has always been regarded as one of the vital factors for motivating PV-BESS integrated energy systems investment. Therefore, given the integrity of the project lifetime, an optimization model for evaluating sizing, operation simulation, and cost-benefit into the PV-BESS integrated energy systems is proposed. The simulation results on an industrial area with the needs of PV + BESS project construction demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model. The cost-benefit analysis reveals the cost superiority of PV-BESS investment compared with the pure utility grid supply. In addition, the operation simulation of the PV-BESS integrated energy system is carried out showing that how the energy arbitrage is realized. Finally, sensitivity analysis of BESS installations limit is investigated to inform the optimal balance of PV and BESS investments. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB With more energy networks being interconnected to form integrated energy systems (IESs), the optimal energy flow (OEF) problem has drawn increasing attention. Extant studies on OEF models mostly utilize the finite difference method (FDM) to address partial-differential-equation (PDE) constraints related to the dynamics in natural gas networks (NGNs) and district heating networks (DHNs). However, this time-domain approach suffers from a heavy computational burden with regard to achieving high finite-difference accuracy. In this paper, a novel OEF model that formulates NGN and DHN constraints in the frequency domain and corresponding model compaction techniques for efficient solving are contributed. First, an energy circuit method (ECM) that alge-braizes the PDEs of NGNs and DHNs in the frequency domain is introduced. Then, an ECM-based OEF model is formulated, which contains fewer variables and constraints than an FDM-based OEF model and thereby yields better solving efficiency. Finally, variable space projection is employed to remove implicit variables, by which another constraint generation algorithm is enabled to remove redundant constraints. These two techniques further compact the OEF model and bring about a second improvement in solving efficiency. Numerical tests on actual systems indicate the final OEF model reduces variables and constraints by more than 95% and improves the solving efficiency by more than 10 times. In conclusion, the proposed OEF model and solving techniques well meet the optimization needs of large-scale IESs.

AB Hydrogen-enriched compressed natural gas pemetrated integrated energy system (HPIES) stands as a highly promising technique for enhancing energy efficiency and mitigating emissions, owing to its capacity to effectively address the issue of elevated hydrogen transportation expenses. Traditional integrated energy systems (IESs) fail to describe the impact of hydrogen blending on gas properties, gas transportation, and gas separation, and face economic challenges. Therefore, in this paper, a novel HPIES optimal scheduling model is established considering the multi-membrane hydrogen separation and the variable efficiency model of electrolyzer. Firstly, the HPIES model, considering variable hydrogen doping ratio and uncertain starting flow direction, is developed. Secondly, in HPIES, two kinds of membranes are combined to forma multi- membrane hydrogen separation model. The thermodynamics of the electrolyzer and the bubble coverage model are considered in the optimization of HPIES. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by taking IEEE 39 - bus power system and 20 - node natural gas system as an example. In addition, the results indicate that HPIES can accurately reflect the flow of the system, and it has led to a cost reduction of $439,156. Meanwhile, the model demonstrates that multi-membrane hydrogen separation can reduce 46.861 MW and 38.359 MW, respectively, in a single day compared to the other two membranes. The variable efficiency model of the electrolyzer can reflect the trend of changes in the electrolyzer.

AB Ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) are now widely used in community integrated energy systems (CIES) because of their high efficiency in energy conversion. However, the coefficient of performance (COP) of GSHPs is unstable if the soil temperature changes with seasonal imbalanced cooling and heating loads, thus downgrading the overall performance of CIES. In this paper, an annual optimization model for CIES that considers the seasonal balance of GSHPs is established. Then, a day-ahead operation strategy based on the pre-allocated load of the GSHP in the yearly balance is proposed while considering the uncertainties in daily conditions. The proposed strategy is validated on a practical CIES in China and assessed on a year-round time scale. The results show that the operation of CIES can be stable, economical and sustainable while ensuring the seasonal balance of the GSHP.

AB Shared energy storage is widely recognized as an energy hub for the coordinated operation of regional integrated energy systems (RIESs). Multi-energy systems (MESs) share centralized energy storage to store excess renewable energy sources (RESs). This paper proposes a novel energy-sharing framework considering hydrogen trading, which is suitable for residential, industrial, and commercial RIES structures. Shared energy storage operator (SESO) promotes hydrogen energy transactions by formulating time-of-use (TOU) hydrogen prices. The proposed hydrogen energy trading method can be regarded as a master-client structure, and a hierarchical optimal scheduling method based on the Stackelberg game relationship is designed. Finally, a case study is performed based on an optimal scheduling algorithm combining particle swarm optimization (PSO) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP). The cases show the electricity-hydrogen shared energy storage mechanism in RIESs can improve the RESs utilization rate and effectively reduce the operating costs of each system. Moreover, compared with RIESs with a single centralized electric energy storage, the TOU hydrogen price mechanism can further lower the energy prices and improve the economy of the RIES. The cases show that hydrogen energy sharing reduces the operating cost of RIES by 9.96% and increases the regional energy utilization rate by 2.97%. And the shared energy storage business model can satisfy the economy of both SESO and RIES. It confirms the rationality of the electric hydrogen shared energy storage project.

AB The coordinated operation of regional integrated electricity and district heating systems (RIEDHS) can significantly improve energy efficiency. This paper considers the dynamic characteristics of the pipelines in the district heating systems (DHS) and the thermal inertia of buildings with different heating modes, and establishes a distributed optimal scheduling model of RIEDHS. In addition, due to the computational complexity of large-scale integrated energy systems, heavy communication burdens, and the privacy-preserving difficulties of multiple operators, a centralized solution is actually not feasible for RIEDHS. Based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, a distributed method for solving the RIEDHS problem is proposed. In order to enhance the convergence of the algorithm, the ADMM with variable penalty parameters is adopted. The effectiveness and superiority of the method are verified by case studies. The results show that the optimal scheduling model can make full use of the thermal inertia of buildings, reduce system operating costs, and promote photovoltaic consumption.

AB In order to evaluate the hybrid renewable configurations in diverse applications, this inquiry tries to propose a novel decision-making procedure. The open-source WEC dynamics simulator, exergetic assessment, and Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables Pro software are integrated. In this innovative method, the exergy of the component is calculated using MATLAB software. Technical analysis for the goal of rural electrification is examined in this work. Thus, several integrated energy systems are technically researched. This study deals with the exergy, environmental, and exergoenvironmental analyses of the hybrid renewable energy system, to assess its performance and environmental impact when operating on Siri Island. In the photovoltaic solar panels, wind turbines, wave energy converters, diesel generators, and batteries set up, the total exergy efficiency and exergy destruction rate were 18.4% and 7.24 x 10(6) kWh/year, respectively. Additionally, it was discovered that the wave energy converter was responsible for 5% of the total energy wasted. Photovoltaic solar panels, wind turbines, and wave energy converters all have mean annual exergy efficiencies calculated to be 11.7%, 13.1%, and 20.8%, respectively. Environmental and exergoenvironmental analyses illustrate that the off-grid scenario decreases CO2 emission by 95% compared to the on-grid scenario and utilizing diesel generators increases the exergy stability factor of the energy system. The suggested decision-making procedure can be a potent and reliable instrument for analyzing any hybrid renewable arrangement from a technological standpoint.

AB Regional integrated energy systems (RIES) have garnered increased attention because they highly utilize renewable energy, comprehensive efficiency, and flexible operation. However, the current research on RIESs is mainly based on burning natural gas and supplemented by renewable energy, which will consumes much primary energy and generates corresponding carbon emissions. Therefore, a RIES contained various renewable energy sources and station energy sharing was constructed in this paper. Both the collaborative optimization model, which considered the operating parameters and system configuration, and the hierarchical optimization model, which optimizes the equipment configuration at the upper layer and the operational parameters at the underlayer, were constructed, respectively. Taking a multi-function low-carbon park as an example, the isolated integrated energy system (IIES) and RIES performances were explored. Finally, the operation cost, carbon emission, and interactive power in the separated production system, IIES and RIES were analyzed and discussed from a long-short time scale perspective. The results showed that the carbon emission, interactive power, and energy supply cost of the RIES's unit area are 7.62 kg/m2, 10.07 kWh/m2, and 40.55 CNY/m2, respectively. Long time scale perspective (Years or months), RIESs could significantly reduce carbon emissions and interactive power. However, on a short time scale viewpoint (Hours), the system's instantaneous energy conservation and carbon reduction effect was general; meanwhile, the maximum grid-connected power in IIES and RIES was 2617.7 and 2712.0 kW, respectively.

AB Wind power generation curve generally has the reverse characteristic with the peak regulation of electricity load curve, which will lead to serious wind abandonment and energy waste. The development of integrated energy systems and energy storage maybe change this predicament. Based on the infrastructure and operation model of regional integrated energy system, this paper studied the allocation priority of cooling, heating, electricity storage and electricity to gas (P2G) system, considering multiple energy complementary and collaborative operation of combined cooling heating and power (CCHP) units and other equipment. Firstly, the operation benefit increment index was proposed to quantify the operation cost variation, also named promotion effect in this paper, between the scenarios of integrated energy system without/with certain form energy storage added. Then, an configuration optimization model of multiple energy storage devices based on operation benefit increment was put forward. By employing an industrial district integrated energy system in northern China as the study case, the operation scheduling scheme and the priority of energy storage configuration were solved by the optimization strategy proposed in this paper. And the promotion effects of different energy storage configurations were analyzed from the viewpoint of operation economy of the integrated energy system. The results show that the abandoned wind power and the cost of environmental pollution control are reduced in the integrated energy system with four kinds of energy storage. And the economic efficiency is greatly improved.

AB This paper mainly focuses on the low-carbon economic dispatch and energy sharing method of multiple Integrated Energy Systems (IES) from the perspective of System of Systems. First, a new model of carbon quota allocation and trading considering carbon balance and carbon sharing among multiple systems is established, and a low-carbon economic dispatch and energy sharing framework based on efficient utilization of regional carbon quota is proposed. Then, a Stackelberg game-based optimization model is proposed for energy service provider (ESP) and IES groups based on the collaborative optimization of IES and carbon transaction cost, where the ESP acts as a leader who chooses proper interactive price to promote energy sharing within the system while IES serves as a follower who minimizes its operation cost in response to the interactive price set by ESP. Moreover, the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium are analyzed and a decentralized solution algorithm is suggested to reach the goal of optimal energy sharing and optimal operation. Finally, the case study of a joint energy sharing system containing three regional IESs are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can not only increase profit of ESP and IES, but helpful to promote the optimal utilization of energy resources and the optimal distribution of carbon emission quota among energy systems.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The pathway towards decarbonised energy systems involves massive changes in adopted energy vectors, installed technologies, networks roles, and interaction capabilities. To investigate the combination of these effects, this work presents the OMNI-ES modelling framework (Optimisation Model for Network-Integrated Energy Systems), which offers a comprehensive approach to analyse multi-node, multi-vector, multi-sector energy systems. It adopts a detailed temporal and spatial resolution and implements multiple conversion options between energy vectors (electricity, hydrogen, natural gas, biomethane, biofuels, e-fuels, ...). The formulation solves the energy vector balances at each time step, taking into account sources, sinks, conversion processes, and storage systems. CO2 flows are also tracked, allowing the introduction of CO2 emission constraints that account for all contributions (fossil and biogenic, direct and indirect) and mitigation measures (capture, re-use, sequestration). In the article, OMNI-ES is applied to investigate an Italian scenario for 2050, adopting a regional (NUTS-2) resolution. The model output yields the cost-optimal energy system configuration that is capable to support the demand with net-zero CO2 emissions. Results show that the need for CO2 balance closure calls in several technologies, including massive renewable power generation (up to 20 times today's capacities), storage systems (batteries, hydrogen, pumped hydro), biogenic sources (residual biomass and biomethane), and CO2 capture (both on fossil and biogenic sources). Networks emerge as critical elements, as the need to transport energy vectors saturates the expected capacities of grid infrastructures, especially in the case of hydrogen.

AB The intermittency and uncertainty of new energy can easily lead to a mismatch between the supply and demand of energy, which limits the wide application of integrated energy systems. Based on these considerations, we propose an optimal scheduling model for an IES considering the bilateral interaction mechanism between supply and demand and the reward-penalty ladder type of carbon trading. Firstly, a CSP-P2G-CHP joint operation system is constructed based on the energy load demand and the operation characteristics of each piece of equipment. Secondly, an integrated demand response model considering customer comfort and the coupled response characteristics of hot and cold power demand is established by combining the price elasticity model of electric load with the inertia of the heat and cold load. A reward-penalty ladder type of carbon trading mechanism is introduced. Finally, the optimal dispatching model is established to minimize the total cost of the IES by calling the YALMIP toolbox through MATLAB and solving it using the GUROBI solver. The simulation results of eight cases show that the dual response of supply and demand can not only increase the coordination and optimization ability of the IES but also achieve the improvement of the system economy and promote the consumption of renewable energy based on ensuring the comfort of users. At the same time, considering the reward-penalty ladder type of carbon trading model can restrain the carbon emission of the system to a greater extent and synergize the low carbon and economy of the system.

AB Integrated energy systems (IESs) can realize the conversion and complementarity of various energy sources, which provides opportunities and challenges for the energy market. Considering that the user's energy consumption is affected by the energy price difference, there is a problem that the new energy output in the comprehensive energy system does not fully match the user's energy demand period. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a two-stage optimization model of "open source and reducing expenditure" to give full play to the potential of multiple energy sources on the load side to participate in demand response (DR) and combine low-carbon technology and market mechanisms to realize the low-carbon economic operation of the comprehensive energy system. In the first stage, a collaborative optimization strategy for electric and thermal DR is constructed from the aspect of "reducing expenditure," a comprehensive load fuzzy DR mechanism based on the logistic function is constructed for electric load, and the load curve and time-of-use (TOU) energy price are optimized considering the coupling characteristics of user energy consumption, and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) solution to achieve peak shaving and valley filling. In the second stage, a joint operation model of carbon capture power plant (CCPP) and power-to-gas (P2G) equipment is built from the aspect of "open source," and the ladder-type carbon trading mechanism is considered to rationalize the unit output and achieve low-carbon emission reduction. The calculation results obtained through examples show that the total cost of the model is slightly reduced by 5.44%, but the actual total carbon emission of the system is greatly increased by 50.73%. It proves that the high-carbon power plant transformation and TOU energy price optimization strategy are effective for the low-carbon economic operation of the system and realize both economic benefits and benefits of the system.

AB This study conducts an integrated energy system assessment to evaluate pathways for using locally distributed sustainable biomass resources in the conversion to renewable gas and liquid biofuels in future integrated energy systems. A modelling framework with a detailed spatiotemporal representation is used, optimising the usage and transportation of local biomass resources for producing renewable gas and renewable liquid fuels through the OptiFlow model, along with the comprehensive power and district heating model Balmorel, integrating shortterm dynamics in the long-term planning horizon. Results for a fossil-independent Danish energy system by 2050 show that production of bio-jet fuel in Denmark would impose high pressure on national biomass resources. Electrofuels, such as biomethanol, have economic viability and promising potentials. The results regarding renewable gas production show that anaerobic co-digestion of a mixed feedstock to produce biogas, which is further upgraded to biomethane using water scrubbing for CO2 removal, would be the preferred option. Biorefineries are located near larger cities to benefit from economy of scale and access to large district heating networks, as excess heat from biorefineries could supply up to 21% of the national district heating demand. On the contrary, biogas plants would be located in the countryside, as the costs of transporting manure are a determining factor. Therefore, our study provides a novel modelling approach, which enables optimisation of geographical distributed resources for renewable gas and liquid fuel production, while taking synergies across energy vectors in account.

AB Cascaded utilization of natural gas, electric power, and heat could leverage synergetic effects among these energy resources, precipitating the advent of integrated energy systems. In such infrastructures, energy hub is an interface among different energy systems, playing the role of energy production, conversion, and storage. The capacity of energy hub largely determines how tightly these energy systems are coupled and how flexibly the whole system would behave. This paper proposes a data-driven two-stage robust stochastic programming model for energy hub capacity planning with distributional robustness guarantee. Renewable generation and load uncertainties are modelled by a family of ambiguous probability distributions near an empirical distribution in the sense of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence measure. The objective is to minimize the sum of the construction cost and the expected life-cycle operating cost under the worst-case distribution restricted in the ambiguity set. Network energy flow in normal operating conditions is considered; demand supply reliability in extreme conditions is taken into account via robust chance constraints. Through duality theory and sampling average approximation, the proposed model is transformed into an equivalent convex program with a nonlinear objective and linear constraints, and is solved by an outer-approximation algorithm that entails solving only linear program. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and method.

AB Nowadays, natural hazards and extreme events bring about significant losses in various infrastructures including integrated electric power and natural gas networks. Thus, a robust approach is necessary for investment and operation planning of integrated energy systems. This paper presents a novel tri-level planner-disaster-risk-averse-planner framework for investment planning in integrated electric power and natural gas networks (PDP-PEN) under extreme events. The notion of the information-gap decision theory (IGDT) as a proficient non-deterministic optimization technique under severe uncertainty is utilized to enhance the resilience of the integrated system under different types of extreme events in electric power and natural gas networks through a specific parameter named as the budget of resilience. The proposed PDP-PEN framework is solved by means of a tri-level algorithm including (1) first-level: planning problem under normal condition, (2) second-level: resilience evaluation under disastrous condition, and (3) third-level: risk-averse re-planning under disastrous condition using the notion of IGDT. This resilience-oriented investment planning tool is successfully implemented on the integrated Garver 6-node electric power and 8-node natural gas networks as well as the integrated IEEE 24-node electric power and 12-node natural gas networks. Case studies justify the effectiveness of the proposed IGDT-based tri-level approach to enhance the resilience of the integrated energy systems in response to extreme events.

AB Accurate multivariate load forecasting plays an important role in the planning management and safe operation of integrated energy systems. In order to simultaneously reduce the prediction bias and variance, a hybrid ensemble learning method for load forecasting of an integrated energy system combining sequential ensemble learning and parallel ensemble learning is proposed. Firstly, the load correlation and the maximum information coefficient (MIC) are used for feature selection. Then the base learner uses the Boost algorithm of sequential ensemble learning and uses the Bagging algorithm of parallel ensemble learning for hybrid ensemble learning prediction. The grid search algorithm (GS) performs hyper-parameter optimization of hybrid ensemble learning. The comparative analysis of the example verification shows that compared with different types of single ensemble learning, hybrid ensemble learning can better balance the bias and variance and accurately predict multiple loads such as electricity, cold, and heat in the integrated energy system.

AB Redox flow batteries (RFBs) stand out as one of the most promising candidates for stationary energy storage with high scalability and separate control over energy and power. Nevertheless, the widespread application of commercial RFBs is restricted by the relatively high stack cost as well as the uncompetitive performance metrics. Developing new-concept RFBs beyond conventional design frameworks can effectively alleviate these concerns. In this review, we aim to provide comprehensive fundamentals of new chemistries in RFBs toward widespread practical applications. We first introduce the technological features of conventional RFBs, followed by the specific cell architectures and possible optimization approaches on each component. We further review in detail the design principles and demonstrations of the newly developed RFBs, including novel redox species, integrated energy systems, and innovative cell structures. We conclude with a summary on the current challenges and future perspectives in this research field.

AB In integrated energy systems (IESs), traditional fixed time-interval dispatching scheme is unable to adapt to the need of dynamic properties of the transient network, demand response characteristics, dispatching time scales in energy subsystems and renewable power uncertainties. This scheme may easily result in uneconomic source-grid-load-storage operations in IES. In this paper, we propose a dispatching method for IES based on dynamic time-interval of model predictive control (MPC). We firstly build models for energy sub-systems and multi-energy loads in the power-gas-heat IES. Then, we develop an innovative optimization method leveraging trajectory deviation control, energy control, and cost control frameworks in MPC to handle the requirements and constraints over the time-interval of dispatching. Finally, a dynamic programming algorithm is introduced to efficiently solve the proposed method. Experiments and simulation results prove the effectiveness of the method.

AB With the development of distributed energy resources and intelligent energy management technologies, park-level integrated energy systems (PIESs) are essential for multi-energy flow conversion and utilization. However, coordinating the upstream energy sources, internal energy stations, distribution networks, and downstream loads within the PIES framework remains a challenge. Developing a station-network coordinated planning scheme for PIES confronts challenges, such as overly complex models that are difficult to solve and the difficulty of implementing standard methods for medium and long-term planning. This paper proposes a multi-stage coordinated planning approach for PIES, containing energy stations, multi-energy networks, and load aggregation nodes. The energy equipment and energy networks are precisely modelled to enhance the reliability of the planning scheme. The chance-constrained programming (CCP) method is adopted to address uncertainties arising from renewable energy generation. Additionally, the improved big-M method and second-order cone (SOC) relaxation technique are utilized to manage non-linear elements, transforming the model into a mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) form to enhance solution efficiency. A case study illustrates that the proposed method enables effective allocation of equipment and networks, outperforming single-stage planning by reducing investment costs, enhancing facility utilization rates, and facilitating renewable energy integration.

AB The interactive operation of multiple combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) systems can improve the performance of regional integrated energy systems by exploiting the spatiotemporal complementarity of loads. The interaction of various energy networks in the interactive combined cooling, heating, and power (ICCHP) system introduces new challenges to the optimization of the operation strategy. An interactive operation strategy based on the energy complementarity characteristics of the following electric load, following thermal load, and following hybrid electric-heating load operation strategies is proposed in this paper. To investigate the interaction effect on the system performance and the effect mechanisms when it operates interactively between different users, the load heat-to-power ratio of users was first classified and abstracted. Then, the performances of the ICCHP between two users with different loads and between two users with the same loads are analyzed separately. Finally, the effect of a third user was investigated to expand the application of the interactive operating strategy to the multi-user mode. The results showed that the interaction between CCHP systems with different loads can make use of the complementarity between different loads and the energy complementarity of operation strategies, which greatly improves the performance of the ICCHP system. CCHP systems with the same loads can only rely on the energy complementarity of the operation strategies, leading to less improvement in performance. In addition, the performance of the ICCHP system will be significantly improved in the three-CCHP interactive mode if the performance of the third building is higher in independent operation.

AB Integrated energy systems (IESs) are complex prosumers consisting of diverse operating units spanning multiple domains. The tight integration of these units results in varied dynamic characteristics and intricate nonlinear process interactions, making detailed dynamic modeling and successful operational optimization challenging. To address these concerns, we propose a process structure-based hybrid time-series neural network (NN) surrogate to predict the dynamic performance of IESs across multiple time scales. This neural network-based modeling approach develops time-series multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for the operating units and integrates them with prior process knowledge about system structure and fundamental dynamics. This integration forms three hybrid NNs - long-term, slow, and fast MLPs - that predict the entire system dynamics across multiple time scales. Leveraging these MLPs, we design an NN-based scheduler and an NN-based economic model predictive control (NEMPC) framework to meet global operational requirements: rapid electrical power responsiveness to operators' requests, adequate cooling supply to customers, and increased system profitability, while addressing the dynamic time-scale multiplicity present in IESs. The proposed day-ahead scheduler is formulated using the ReLU network-based MLP, which effectively represents IES performance under abroad range of conditions from a long-term perspective. The scheduler is then exactly recast into a mixed-integer linear programming problem for efficient evaluation. The real-time NEMPC, based on slow and fast MLPs, comprises two sequential distributed control agents: a slow NEMPC for the cooling-dominant subsystem with slower transient responses and a fast NEMPC for the power-dominant subsystem with faster responses. These agents collaborate in the decision-making process to achieve dynamic synergy in real time while reducing computational costs. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the developed scheduler and NEMPC schemes outperform their respective benchmark scheduler and controller by about 25% and 40%. Together, they enhance overall system performance by over 70% compared to benchmark approaches.

AB To address climate change and adapt to the shift in energy systems toward greater intelligence and diversity, integrated energy systems (IES) have emerged as a key approach to improve energy utilization and promote sustainable growth. However, the incorporation of IES adds complexity in harmonizing different mechanisms, complicating the simultaneous consideration of carbon emissions and operational expenses. Accordingly, this study introduces a bi-level optimal scheduling approach for IES that addresses current scheduling limitations, balances supply and demand, and includes carbon emissions management, with the integration of incentivedriven demand response (DR) and green certificate-carbon trading mechanisms. Firstly, a DR model utilizing time-of-use power pricing and dynamic carbon emission variables is established, directing consumers to adopt low-carbon behaviors through the transmission of carbon signals. Secondly, the interaction mechanism between green certificate trading (GCT) and carbon emission trading (CET) is examined, facilitating the coordinated operation of carbon quotas and pricing variables while preventing the double counting of carbon reduction attributes. Thirdly, a bi-level low-carbon economic optimization model has been built. The upper-level strategy aims to reduce supply-side costs related to CET and GCT, whereas the lower-level strategy seeks to optimize energy consumption and carbon emission costs on the demand side, thereby achieving coordinated optimization of carbon emissions and economic costs across both supply and demand sides. Finally, findings from the case study reveal that implementing green certificate-carbon trading along with incentive-based demand response effectively lowers operational costs and carbon emissions by 23.14 % and 16.38 %, respectively.

AB Under the background of carbon emission abatement worldwide, carbon trading is becoming an important carbon financing policy to promote emission mitigation. Aiming at the emerging coupling among various energy sectors, this paper proposes a bi-level scheduling model to investigate the low-carbon operation of the electricity and natural gas integrated energy systems (IES). Firstly, an optimal energy flow model considering carbon trading is formulated at the upper level, in which carbon emission flow model is employed to track the carbon flows accompanying energy flows and identify the emission responsibility from the consumption-based perspective, and the locational marginal price is determined at the same time. Then at the lower level, a developed demand-side management strategy is introduced, which can manage demands in response to both the dynamic energy prices and the nodal carbon intensities, enabling the user side to participate in the joint energy and carbon trading. The bi-level model is solved iteratively and reaches an equilibrium. Finally, case studies based on the IEEE 39-bus system and the Belgium 20-node system illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing carbon emissions and improving consumer surplus.

ID DEMAND RESPONSE
AB Virtual Energy Stations (VESs) can aggregate customer-side Integrated Energy Systems (IESs) to participate in electricity and natural gas markets. It helps to promote the synergies among different energies, lower IESs' energy cost, and balance the supply and demand of power systems. This paper proposes an exergy-driven optimal scheduling method of VES based on coordinated cooperative and Stackelberg games to regulate IESs via demand response (DR) effectively and economically. Firstly, the VES operation framework with equal exergy replacement is developed to unify the energy adjustment and conversion of IESs for less energy cost and lower economic loss risk. Secondly, the scheduling models of VES and IESs based on Cooperative and Stackelberg Games are proposed. VES forms a cooperative alliance with IESs to respond to external energy markets' price fluctuations for overall benefit maximization. Then the Stackelberg game theory is employed to characterize the interest -conflict behaviors of VES and IESs. It can maximize the overall interests of VES and IES, achieve more flexibility from IESs, and improve IESs' enthusiasm in DR. Thirdly, the equilibrium solution existence of the VES optimal scheduling model based on game theories is proved. A distributed solution method based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is provided to avoid the privacy information leakage of VES and IESs. Simulation results show that VES takes the main risks caused by the energy market prices' fluctuations, which helps to increase the enthusiasm of IESs in DR. And the proposed incentive mechanism has superior properties compared to the sole cooperative game or Stackelberg game.

AB With the increasing integration of renewable energy into power grids, integrated energy systems (IES) have gained global attention. However, the stochastic and uncertain characteristics of wind and solar challenge the stable grid operation significantly. To address these issues, this article proposes an optimal scheduling model for wind-solar-hydrogen IES, incorporating prediction uncertainty and demand response (DR). The equilibrium decision theory framework, combined with frequency enhanced decomposed transformer, interval prediction and decision, is proposed to quantify the uncertainties and determine the action plans. Then, an optimal scheduling model is designed to maximize economic revenue and minimize pollution emissions (PE), which is solved using multiobjective elephant clan optimization algorithm. Furthermore, DR strategy is integrated to enhance system flexibility and stability. Empirical results demonstrate that increased uncertainty leads to more conservative scheduling, improving system robustness. Additionally, DR boosts ER by over 3.50% and reduces PE by more than 3.20% across various scenarios.

AB Multiple park-level integrated energy systems (PIESs) energy sharing can fully exploit the synergies of complementary PIESs to realize the efficient utilization of flexible resources, while it also faces challenges of privacy protection and benefits allocation. Therefore, a distributed low-carbon scheduling model considering game-theoretical energy sharing among PIESs is proposed, and the benefits allocation method is improved. First, the integrated demand response and carbon trading mechanism are combined to motivate the demand-side flexibility potential and promote the low-carbon development. Second, a decentralized energy sharing framework is established based on the cooperative game theory and distributed optimization algorithm. Furthermore, considering the output uncertainties of renewable energy, the accuracy of the renewable energy forecasting results is quantified into the benefits allocation process to improve the traditional Shapley value, thus achieving a more fair and reasonable profits coordination. Finally, case studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed model in reducing carbon emissions, improving the economic performance and coordinating the complex stakeholders.

Firstly, it describes the impacts of correlated uncertainty on the actual output of the source and load based on factor analysis and affine variables, and constructs an affine optimization model for cooperative scheduling of system-wide flexible resources. Secondly, according to the energy supply envelope area of flexible resources within the scheduling cycle, it proposes the value measurement indices of system flexibility adjustment ability and economic benefit to evaluate the sensitivity of flexible resources. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the conservatism of the scheduling scheme, and analyzing the influence of capacities and time-of-use tariff on flexibility value provides a reference for the construction of integrated energy systems in rural areas.

AB In the context of energy interconnection and low-carbon power, the integrated energy system (IES) has become an important method for multiple energy coordination as well as energy conservation and emission reduction. To further facilitate the low-carbon development of IES, this paper proposes a multi-district integrated energy systems scheduling model considering the carbon emission trading (CET) mechanism and green certificate trading (GCT) mechanism. First, we analyze the feasibility of introducing the carbon-green certificate trading mechanism into IES and establish a carbon-green certificate joint trading market framework, in which the combinatorial double auction (CDA) mechanism is employed to bid for green certificates to determine the best transaction price of green certificates. Second, a heating network, natural gas network and optimization model as well as related constraints of the IES are established. Finally, we analyze the different impacts of CETs, GCTs and changes in natural gas prices on system operating costs. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed model.

AB Novel analytic modeling and design method is proposed for the analysis of geothermal-integrated energy systems which provide space heating and cooling. Rather than building a complex optimization framework, an analytic design procedure is developed to determine hourly and monthly distribution of renewable-sourced energy and its sizing in a systematic manner by considering renewable characteristics and energy storage. The new design method also allows to fully realize the advantage of geothermal energy through the seasonal supply of heating and cooling and to accommodate variable generation of other renewables. The benefit of this short-cut design method has been fully illustrated with two case studies in which geothermal energy is used for the provision of combined heat and cooling in domestic and commercial applications. Case studies also demonstrate the impact of time-dependent generation of renewable energy on the sizing of energy suppliers and its seasonal or hourly allocation of working loads.

AB With the wide application of integrated energy systems (IES), the degree of coupling between different types of energy sources is further strengthened, and the mechanism of fault development tends to be complicated. Therefore, in order to improve the accuracy and practicability of the reliability assessment of IESs, a sequential simulation reliability assessment method considering multi-energy flow and thermal inertia is proposed in this paper. In this method, the IES structure model is constructed with the combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) unit as the core equipment, combining with the new energy source to realize the comprehensive energy power flow calculation considering any loss. Then, a load reduction optimization model is established, considering the importance of load and operational economy, in the system status analysis. Furthermore, the heat supply reliability index is corrected taking into account the transmission delay characteristics and terminal thermal inertia. A case study based on the 20-node and the analysis of the influence factors demonstrates the validity of the proposed method.

AB This study proposes an optimized dispatch model for integrated energy systems (IES) incorporating electric vehicles (EVs) and carbon emission trading (CET) to analyze their dynamic interactions. The model aims to minimize IES operating costs by systematically evaluating the impacts of EV penetration levels and CET parameters on economic and environmental performance. Methodologically, Monte Carlo simulations characterize stochastic EV behaviors, a stepwise CET mechanism is developed with emission thresholds, and piecewise linearization combined with convex relaxation transforms nonlinear constraints into tractable formulations. The YALMIP/GUROBI solver is employed to compare eight dispatch scenarios. Key results demonstrate that integrating EVs with carbon capture under CET reduces operating costs by 7.64% and emissions by 17.68%. System emissions exhibit a U-shaped relationship with EV penetration, reaching a minimum at 9.20%. Maximum emission reductions from EV charging optimization occur when CET prices range 250-300 CNY/ton and EV penetration spans 12.31%-19.43%, providing critical thresholds for policy design.

AB The emergence of Integrated Energy Systems (IES) offers a promising solution for low-carbon transformation and enhancing energy efficiency in industrial park energy systems. Grounded in symbiosis theory, this study evaluates the symbiotic fitness status of three functional components ("resource-project-demand" chain) within IES in industrial parks (IES-IP). We establish a symbiotic fitness evaluation framework centered on key symbiotic parameters and develop a corresponding model to analyze five case studies. Comparative analysis of cumulative absolute relative deviations reveals that the weighting method incorporating moment estimation theory demonstrates superior performance among combined weighting approaches. The most influential criteria are found to be renewable energy resource potential (resource side), effective clean energy utilization rate (project side), and industrial-commercial electricity price peak-valley differentials (demand side). All five cases exhibit symbiotic fitness degrees surpassing the baseline threshold (point symbiosis, extremely unfit), though remaining below the optimal level (integrated symbiosis, perfectly fit). The obstacle degree model combined with symbiotic fitness coefficient analysis provides actionable insights for system optimization.

AB This article addresses the issue of privacy-preserving distributed economic dispatch in integrated energy systems (IESs). We propose the time-varying inherent privacy-preserving consensus algorithm (TVIPPCA) without involving a third party, aimed at safeguarding sensitive information during communication and ensuring optimal energy provision at minimal cost. The proposed TVIPPCA is designed with inherent privacy protection for each private variable, featuring a two-layer security strategy. The first layer of security is achieved through an intrinsic node decomposition mechanism coupled with random mixing coefficients, effectively shielding key system parameters from potential adversaries. The second layer enhances privacy preservation by designing a time-varying weight matrix strategy, further obfuscating the information transmitted. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, the proposed TVIPPCA is proven to converge to the optimal value while strictly protecting the privacy of sensitive information. Simulations in a 39-32 node IES validate the algorithm's efficacy in cost optimization and privacy protection.

AB The development of the cutting-edge technologies in cogeneration and trigeneration has led to a rapid transition toward integrated energy systems and the mushrooming of energy hubs, calling for effective energy management schemes. This paper proposes a distributed algorithm for autonomous energy management (AEM) of a cluster of residential energy hubs. Given the interactive behaviors of energy purchasing at the supply side, we treat each hub as a self-interested agent, and formulate the AEM problem of these hubs as a monotone generalized Nash game (MON-GNG). On one hand, there are global coupling constraints representing the supply limits of the input energy systems, which are imposed by the limited capacities of electrical feeders and natural gas pipelines, thus making it a GNG. On the other hand, the cost function of each hub is merely convex in its actions considering the input-to-output energy transformation inside and the impacts of the energy storage devices, which leads to an MON game. The existence of the generalized Nash equilibria (GNEs) of this MON-GNG can be theoretically guaranteed. Then, by reformulating the MON-GNG as a variational inequality problem with special decomposition structure, an efficient and single-loop distributed algorithm is then proposed for computing a GNE with clear economic interpretation based on an improved Tikhonov regularization technique. Principles of parameter selection that will guarantee convergence are suggested. Numeric simulations validate the convergence performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

ID WIND
AB Under the "carbon peak and carbon neutrality" goal, the construction of an efficient, low-carbon, and economical energy supply system is of great significance for advancing a dual carbon strategy. In allusion to the integrated energy systems (IES) with hydrogen energy coupling, a hydrogen energy coupling IES low-carbon optimization operation strategy that took account of green certificate and ladder-type carbon joint trading and dual-incentive demand response was proposed in this paper. First, a hydrogen energy multiuse system composed of an electrolyzer, a hydrogen fuel cell, a methane reactor, and hydrogen energy storage was constructed to make full use of the low-carbon cleaning characteristics of hydrogen energy. Besides, a combined model of hydrogen mixed with natural gas was established to improve the utilization efficiency of hydrogen energy. Second, a dual-incentive demand response model including price incentives and subsidy incentives was constructed to fully use the ability to adjust demand-side resources. Next, in view of the carbon emission reduction mechanism of the green certificate, a green certificate and ladder-type carbon joint trading mechanism was constructed. In addition, a green certificate trading mechanism and a reward and punishment tiered carbon trading mechanism had been introduced separately in the IES optimization operation model to reduce carbon emissions of the system. The calculation simulation sets up different scenarios for comparative analysis. As shown by the results, the proposed model could effectively improve renewable energy consumption capacity and energy utilization efficiency. The effectiveness of hydrogen energy utilization, demand respond, and green certification carbon trading mechanism in improving system economy and low-carbon efficiency is verified.

   Low-carbon economic optimization; Organic rankine cycle
AB This article investigates the low-carbon economic operation problem of commercial park-level integrated energy systems (PIES), with a focus on the refined modeling of diverse flexible resources in both supply and demand sides. In the supply side, the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is integrated into the combined heat and power (CHP) system to realize flexible outputs, instead of being constrained at a fixed thermoelectric ratio. In the demand side, the building's central air conditioning (CAC) load is modeled by a thermal equilibrium equation, capturing CAC flexibility more accurately. Additionally, given the unique commuting patterns of commercial parks, battery swapping stations (BSS) and electric vehicles are also characterized as flexible demand-side resources. The BSS is modeled as a generalized energy storage device through Minkowski summation to reduce model dimensionality. To address carbon responsibility, a ladder carbon trading mechanism is implemented to constrain the park's carbon emissions. Simulation results show that the proposed model achieves a 22 % cost savings and a 5 % carbon emission reduction compared to traditional operation strategies. This demonstrates that the coordination of supply-demand flexibility significantly improves economic and environmental performance in commercial PIES operation.

AB Simulation and operation optimization studies on the integrated energy system have received extensive attention recently for its potential in improving energy efficiency and increasing grid integration of renewable energy, where the task of energy flow calculation serves as a fundamental tool to determine the network states. This paper investigates the models and methods for dynamic energy flow analysis of two strongly coupled networks in the integrated energy systems - the power grid and the heating network. First, the complicated coupling mechanisms of power grid and heating network are thoroughly analyzed and classified into four representative coupling modes. On this basis, the detailed dynamic energy flow analysis method for each coupling mode is developed. Second, a refined difference scheme is applied to discretize the partial differential equations describing the long-lasting temperature dynamics in the heating network. The high-dimensional dicretized model is then solved by a novel decomposition-iteration algorithm. Compared with existing methods, this algorithm avoids deriving the gigantic coefficient matrix of network equations and can improve the accuracy of energy flow results. Finally, considering the systematical error caused by neglecting the inertial and adjusting constraints of heat sources, a revision stage is firstly introduced to correct the heat power output of the slack source and help obtain more accurate energy flow results. Case study shows that the proposed methods take 3.21 s to obtain the dynamic energy flows of a coupled system consisting of a 118-node power grid and eight 35-node district heating networks over a 300-minutes simulation course, which is qualified to provide support for simulation and optimization related applications in practice.

AB Integrated energy systems with the deep coupling of electric power, natural gas, and heat have attracted much interest lately. In the modeling of such an integrated electric -gas -heat system (IEGHS), there is the problem of generation-load uncertainty. The literature has not yet addressed the uncertainties related to pipeline parameters and buried temperature in a natural gas network. To fill this gap, a robust stochastic optimal dispatching model has been proposed in this paper, which can effectively solve the IEGHS dispatching problem under multiple uncertainties. A robust adjustable uncertain set is adopted to deal with the uncertainties of wind power generation and pipeline parameters. The Wasserstein generative adversarial network based on gradient normalization is proposed to generate load -side demand scenarios. Then, a column and constraint generation algorithm is adopted to solve the proposed model. The simulation analysis successfully demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed model and algorithm. By utilizing this approach, the system can obtain a scheduling scheme with the lowest operating cost even under worst -case scenarios.

AB This paper proposes a low-carbon energy scheduling model for integrated energy systems (IES) considering offshore wind power hydrogen production and dynamic hydrogen doping strategy. The offshore wind electrolysis system, hydrogen mixed gas turbine (HMGT), carbon capture, utilization and storage, and laddered carbon trading are introduced to reflect the values of hydrogen blending in carbon emission reduction for IES. A carbon emission and combustion model for HMGT based on the system thermodynamics and chemical reaction kinetics is presented. The dynamic hydrogen doping strategy is leveraged to consider the impact of gas composition variations on HMGT operating and gas system. Then, an energy balance-based quasi-steadystate model is proposed to deal with the different calorific value of the gas mixture. In order to effectively solve the resulting highly nonlinear and nonconvex problem arising from the varying hydrogen blending ratio, the nonlinear hydrogen production efficiency, and the convex-concave energy balance-based quasi-steadystate model, a tractable solution formulation is proposed. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

ID OPERATION
AB The multi-community integrated energy system (MCIES) has become a practical approach to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions with the promotion of urbanization. However, the current optimal scheduling of MCIES neither balances the total operation cost of the MCIES and the individual benefits of community microgrids effectively nor considers the carbon emission accounting and carbon trading of terminal integrated energy systems adequately. In this study, a bi-level optimal scheduling framework dominated by the regional dispatching center (RDC) and fully participated by the community integrated energy systems (CIESs) is developed for the scheduling of MCIES, which considers the energy interaction and carbon trading between CIESs. Firstly, a refined carbon emission accounting model considering direct and indirect carbon emissions is proposed, which can calculate the carbon emissions of each CIES in detail from the energy flow perspective based on the definition of virtual and actual carbon flow. Then, a one-master-multi-slave game model is established, where the RDC acts as the leader pursuing the minimum operation cost of the region by formulating energy interaction and carbon trading schemes between CIESs, while the CIESs are regarded as the followers that adjust the energy consumptions to minimize their operation costs. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed optimization model is validated through the case studies, which are tested in a specific urban area. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed optimal scheduling model can not only effectively coordinate the benefits between RDC and CIESs, but also reduce the overall operational cost and carbon emission of the MCIES.

AB The wind abandonment phenomenon of cogeneration units in regional integrated energy systems (RIES) under the operation mode of "heat for electricity" and the improvement in the operation efficiency of the energy storage system under a low-temperature environment are problems that need to be solved urgently. To this end, a regional integrated energy system optimization scheduling method based on fine energy storage and wind power consumption is proposed in the paper. First, a fine energy storage model more adapted to a low-temperature environment is established on the power side to accurately simulate the actual working state of the energy storage components and quantify the uncertainty of the wind power output using the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) theory. Then, a combined heat and power demand response mechanism is introduced on the load side to reduce the peak-to-valley difference in the heat and power loads, it is realized to promote the system's consumption of wind power without increasing the transmission power of the contact line. Finally, the example is solved on the MATLAB platform with the objective of minimizing the total cost of the RIES optimal dispatch. The simulation results show that the proposed model is not only more adaptable to a low-temperature environment compared with the traditional model but also reduces the overall cost of the system by 2.58% while realizing the complete consumption of wind power. This innovative study provides a feasible and efficient solution to improve the performance of integrated energy systems, especially the operation capability in extreme environments.

AB Given the energy crisis and severe environmental pollution, it is crucial to improve the energy utilization efficiency of integrated energy systems (IESs). Most existing studies on the optimal operation of IESs are based on the first law of thermodynamics without considering energy quality and direction attributes. The obtained strategies generally fail to accurately reflect the difference in energy quality. Based on the second law of thermodynamics, we first analyzed the energy quality coefficients of energy in different forms and expressed the exergy flow as the product of energy quality coefficients and energy flow. An exergy analysis model of the electric-gas-thermal integrated energy system was also established based on the energy network theory. Second, modeling and analyzing the dynamic characteristics of gas-thermal networks and the corresponding energy storage capacities were explored. Considering the dynamic characteristics of the gas-thermal pipeline network, the useful energy stored in the pipelines was analyzed based on the energy quality coefficients of natural gas and the thermal energy system, and the flexibility capacity of each subsystem was also analyzed in combination with the operation of units. A simulation analysis was then conducted on the electric-gas-thermal IES 39-20-6 system. The results demonstrated that from an energy perspective, the loss in the coupling equipment only accounts for 29.05% of the total energy losses, while from an exergy perspective, its proportion is as high as 46.47%. Besides, under the exergy analysis, when the dynamic characteristics of the gas-thermal pipeline network are taken into account, the wind curtailment rates of the system decrease from 11.22% to 8.27%.

AB Integrated multi-energy systems, due to their flexibility and complementary characteristics, are considered an important energy system structure for accommodating high renewable penetration, and thus have attracted great attention of global research recently. Based on the energy hub, a two-stage optimal design and planning method for regional integrated energy systems (IES) is proposed in this paper, Furthermore, the demand side response (DSR) is taken into consideration. The EnergyPlus simulation software is used to produce multi-energy load data for various types of buildings in urban areas. Then, the improved k-means data clustering method and the Kolmogorov Distance scene reduction technology are applied to generate three types of typical scenarios. The objective of optimal IES planning is to minimize total capital cost, O&M cost, and the shifting load compensation cost while making sure the system operates reliably and safely. The column-and-constraint (CCG) generation algorithm is implemented to achieve fast optimization solution. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the benefits of IES with complementary multi-energies are reflected. (C) 2020 TheAuthors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Under the background of global energy conservation, the energy hub (EH)-based integrated energy system is becoming the transition direction of future energy structure. In this paper, we study the cooperative economic scheduling problem for multiple neighboring integrated energy systems on the basis of EH. Different with the traditional non-cooperative mode where each EH operates individually, these EHs constitute a cooperative community and can share energy among them. Considering the autonomy and self-interest of different EHs, the coordinated management problem is modeled as a bargaining cooperative game, where involved EHs will bargain with each other about the exchanged energy and the associated payments. The bargaining solution can achieve a fair and Pareto-optimal balance among the objective functions of different EHs. A distributed optimization is applied to find the bargaining solution of the cooperative system, to guarantee the autonomous scheduling and information privacy of EHs. Numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the bargaining-based cooperative economic scheduling framework, and also show the improvement of benefits of the community system.

AB The inherent linkage between a power distribution system (PDS) and a district heating system (DHS) necessitates coordinated load restoration after natural disasters. To guarantee optimal load restoration during a recovery process, a coordinated dispatch strategy of the maintenance crew for the PDS/DHS considering the optimal reconfiguration of their respective networks is proposed in this paper. The proposed solution focuses on the intricate mutual interaction of the DHS and PDS and coordinates the fault isolation and service restoration stages. The proposed optimization is modeled as a mixed-integer second-order cone problem (MISOCP), which contains numerous integer variables. To lessen the computational burden, a two-stage acceleration algorithm is proposed, which divides the solution procedure into two stages based on two types of integer variables: load status variables and variables associated with the maintenance path and network topology. Then, the acceleration principles are proposed to determine the load status variables. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed model are validated by extensive cases, which demonstrate the performance of the coordinated maintenance and reconfiguration in integrated energy systems for fault recovery.

TI Distributed accelerated descent algorithm for energy resource

DT Article
AB Composed of multiple integrated energy systems (IESs) belonging to different stakeholders, multi-agent IESs (MA-IESs) are widely concerned because of data privacy protect. As the basis of planning design and reliability evaluation for MA-IESs, distributed energy resource coordination (DERC) problem is studied in this paper. First, a DERC model for MA-IESs is established, which considers energy conversion process specifically. Meanwhile, a novel distributed accelerated descent (DAD) algorithm is proposed to realize fully distributed solving. Different from most of the existing researches that investigate the DERC with box constraints, the presented algorithm is able to solve the DERC with general convex constraints. Moreover, the backward operators in the method improve the convergence rate to the best of distributed first-order optimization algorithm with fixed step size, O(1/T). Furthermore, the presented approach is initialization robustness when the load fluctuations suddenly happened in MA-IESs. The convergence property, computing, and communication complexity are strictly proved. Finally, the effectiveness of DERC model and DAD algorithm are demonstrated by some modified case studies.

AB With the increasing concern about global energy crisis and environmental pollution, the integrated renewable energy system has gradually become one of the most important ways to achieve energy transition. In the context of the rapid development of hydrogen energy industry, the proportion of hydrogen energy in the energy system has gradually increased. The conversion between various energy sources has also become more complicated, which poses challenges to the planning and construction of park-level integrated energy systems (PIES). To solve this problem, we propose a bi-level planning model for an integrated energy system with hydrogen energy, considering multi-stage investment and carbon trading mechanism. First, the mathematical models of each energy source and energy storage in the park are established respectively, and the independent operation of the equipment is analyzed. Second, considering the operation state of multi-energy coordination, a bi-level planning optimization model is established. The upper level is the capacity configuration model considering the variable installation time of energy facilities, while the lower level is the operation optimization model considering several typical daily operations. Third, considering the coupling relationship between upper and lower models, the bi-level model is transformed into a solvable single-level mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model by using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition and big-M method. Finally, the proposed model and solution methods are verified by comprehensive case studies. Simulation results show that the proposed model can reduce the operational cost and carbon emission of PIES in the planning horizon, and provide insights for the multi-stage investment of PIES.

AB Accelerated decarbonization agenda around the world requires transforming the energy industry from fossil fuel dominated to renewable generation-dominated, which necessitates deployment of energy storage on a significantly larger scale. As a potential alternative for the most widely adopted pumped hydro storage, compressed air energy storage (CAES) is recognized as a promising component of energy sectors. Although numerous studies on CAES have contributed to the improvement of technical readiness, there are few studies on cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate the role of CAES in urban integrated energy systems (IESs). To fill this gap, this paper proposes a planning-operation bi-level framework to evaluate the role of CAES in urban IES, and conducts an empirical study on a realistic urban IES of northern China. The cost-effectiveness of diabatic-CAES (D-CAES) and adiabatic-CAES (A-CAES) are compared in the empirical study. The results show that D-CAES can play an important role in urban IES and replace CHP as the core component to supply heat and power, reducing system overall cost and wind curtailment. The participation of D-CAES in the municipal heating sector is crucial to its superior role in urban IES. The role of A-CAES in the urban IES is relatively marginal in cases with low wind capacity and becomes more important with wind capacity increasing.

AB In northern China, promoting low-carbon heating technologies is pivotal in improving air quality and reducing carbon emissions. Solar-assisted air source heat pump systems have attracted extensive attention for the advantages of high energy efficiency and low carbon emissions. However, the existing reviews on solar-assisted air source heat pump systems mostly focus on technique development. This study comprehensively investigates the challenges and opportunities faced by solar-assisted air source heat pump systems in the combined aspects of technology, economy, and policy in China. Technical obstacles under diverse climate conditions, inefficient thermal energy storage, long payback periods, and a lack of subsidy policies pose significant challenges to solarassisted air source heat pump systems. The main concerns of the solar-assisted air source heat pump system for the user, government, and manufacturer are costs, the financial burden of subsidy, and investment risk, respectively. Advances in new technologies, energy storage materials, defrosting, and optimization methods are promising to improve the performance of solar-assisted air source heat pump systems. Favourable renewable energy policies, energy performance contracting mode, and integrated energy systems give solar-assisted air source heat pump systems a bright future in China. Based on these identified factors, a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis is conducted to propose strategies for the advancement of solarassisted air source heat pump systems. This work is expected to give valuable insights to researchers, users, manufacturers, and policy makers for the promotion of solar-assisted air source heat pump systems towards lowcarbon space heating.

AB As renewable energy production surges, traditional load-leveling strategies for stabilizing terminal loads during planning have shown significant limitations, particularly in the face of uncertainties within integrated energy systems (IES) that can diminish energy efficiency. This study introduces a pioneering two-stage robustness model for IES configuration, offering a comprehensive analysis of how terminal load affects system performance by varying the mix of building types in a region. It uniquely assesses the simultaneous impact of thermal, cooling, and electricity storage under various uncertainties, shedding light on how regional building composition influences the economic viability of energy systems. Findings indicate that uncertainties in renewable energy and demand drive up investment costs, with each 6-unit increment in the robustness parameter increasing total costs by 3.7-4.9 %. The study identifies office-centric areas as optimal for IES implementation and residential areas as less favorable. It also suggests that with an increasing gas-to-electricity price ratio, there should be a strategic increase in energy storage installations, prioritizing thermal/cold energy storage (T/CES) given current pricing. The study concludes with regression models that facilitate expedited system design and feasibility assessments, providing valuable insights for optimizing IES under diverse uncertainties and identifying cost-effective scenarios.

AB The extensive research and application of integrated energy systems (IES) coupled with renewable energy sources have played a pivotal role in alleviating the problems of fossil energy shortage and promoting sustainability to a certain extent. However, the uncertainty of photovoltaic (PV) and wind power in IES increases the difficulty of maintaining stable system operation, posing a challenge to long-term sustainability. In addition, the capacity configuration of each device in IES and the operation strategy under different conditions will also significantly impact the operation cost and expected results of the system, influencing its overall sustainability. To address the above problems, this paper establishes an optimization model based on linear programming to optimize the equipment capacity and operation strategy of IES coupled with PV and wind power with the minimum total annual cost as the objective function, thereby promoting economic sustainability. Moreover, an integrated assessment framework, including economic, energy efficiency, and environmental aspects, is constructed to provide a comprehensive assessment of the operation of IES, ensuring a holistic view of sustainability. Finally, taking the IES of an industrial park in Xi'an, China, as the specific case, sensitivity analysis is used to explore the impact of a variety of critical parameters on the equipment capacity and operating strategy. Additionally, the Monte Carlo method is used to explore the impact of source-load uncertainty on the performance of the IES. The results show that the facilitating or constraining relationship between renewable energy access and the cascading utilization of combined heat and power generation (CHP) energy depends on the relative magnitude of the user load thermoelectric ratio to the prime mover thermoelectric ratio. To cope with the negative impact of source-load uncertainty on the stable operation of the IES, the capacities of the electric chiller and absorption chiller should be increased by 4.0% and 5.8%, respectively. It is worth noting that the increase in the penetration rate of renewable energy has not changed the system's dependence on the grid.

AB With the integration of renewable energy, pumped storage, and new energy storage into multi-area integrated energy systems, the generation control of multi-area integrated energy systems is facing serious challenges. A differential evolution variable parameter vector multi-agent emotional deep Q network is proposed to increase the frequency regulation accuracy and convergence speed of multi-area integrated energy systems. The proposed control framework enhances the performance of artificial emotion by differential evolution and adaptive to the environment; the learning rates and action values of two deep Q networks are emotionalized separately by adaptive artificial emotion based on differential evolution; the action values of two deep Q networks are employed to generate commands for smart generation control through vector control. The proposed control framework is calculated in two-area and four-area integrated energy systems with China Southern Power Grid as the background. The numerical calculation results verify the best control performance and fastest convergence speed of the proposed control framework. The frequency deviations of the two cases are reduced by at least 7.44 % and 8.37 %, respectively; the convergence speed of the control framework in the two cases is increased by at least 2.70 % and 0.84 %, respectively; the power generation costs of the two cases are reduced by at least 305,370.9 $ and 460,186.6 $, respectively; the carbon emissions of the two cases are reduced by at least 10,940 kg and 11,610 kg, respectively.

AB The randomness of renewable energy connected to power systems cannot satisfy the frequency stability and economic dispatch of integrated energy systems. The conventional combined dispatch and control framework can benefit the interests of only a part of energy systems, such as gas/heat/cold systems. Real-time economic smart generation dispatch and control are applied to solve these two problems of integrated energy systems. This paper proposes a relaxed deep generative adversarial network method for the real-time control framework to replace conventional combined methods with multiple time-scale combined frameworks. The proposed approach combines deep learning and relaxed operation with generative adversarial networks as the proposed method. Because of the powerful representation capability of deep learning and the advantages of amplitude constraints of the relaxation operation, the proposed method can simultaneously generate multiple convergent and highperformance generation commands. The proposed method is simulated for simple and large-scale complex integrated energy systems based on a 14-bus with ten natural-gas systems. Furthermore, the generation controller based on the proposed method can economically satisfy the frequency stability for integrated energy systems, mitigate uneven energy distribution and excess energy, improve energy efficiency, and achieve multi-energy complementarity.

AB Integrated energy systems (IESs) are increasingly pivotal in the global shift towards sustainable energy frameworks. Within IESs, the energy management system (EMS) plays a critical role, tasked with optimizing energy allocation to achieve objectives like grid stability, energy reliability, and cost-efficiency. A significant challenge for EMS is the inherent unpredictability of renewable energy. Given this, a model predictive control (MPC)-based real-time energy management framework is proposed, which aims to mitigate the impacts of radiation forecast uncertainties in solar-powered IES. A dual-layer correction mechanism is proposed to quantify forecast uncertainty, resulting in uncertain intervals inferred from the hidden Markov model (HMM). Then, the uncertain intervals are adeptly managed within the MPC decision-making framework through the constraint-tightening method. A case study on solar-powered electricity, heating, and hydrogen IES demonstrates the validity of the proposed framework. Five different sets of energy management strategies, such as deterministic analysis, distributionally robust optimization, and the proposed HMM-MPC are subjected to long-term simulations. Comparative analysis reveals that the proposed method enhances various aspects of the performance metrics, including demand response, energy reliability, and system self-sufficiency.

AB Perforated plates are prevalently used in various integrated energy systems for flow restriction, vibration, and noise reduction. The characteristics of flow energy transfer and loss in perforated plates have a significant impact on its piping systems. The existing design and previous studies largely paid little attention to the characteristics of flow energy variation, resulting in severe performance issues and energy consumption. In this study, the characteristics of energy transfer and loss of cavitation flow with various pressure ratios in single and multi-stage perforated plates were numerically studied. The parameters of energy ratio and energy gradient were developed to effectively evaluate the degree and rate of flow energy variation. Results showed that the contribution to energy loss generated from orifice outlet was relatively larger than the inlet and that the degree and rate of energy variation deceased with the increasing stages during the flow in multi-stage models. Additionally, increased stages of perforated plate resulted in a multi-stage stepped energy drop in throttling orifices, and lead to obvious suppression of the cavitation. This work intends to provide references to cavitation control and energy consumption optimization in piping systems using a perforated plate.

AB The integration of renewable energy into existing energy infrastructure plays a significant role for promoting sustainable development, but it lacks the certain facets of comprehensive feasibility analysis regarding technical, economic, and environmental aspects. This study focuses on integrating solar photovoltaic (PV) energy into the residential sector using a decision tree and design parameters (DPs) optimisation to assess sustainability and meet the electrification requirements of water, energy, and food elements in the residential sector. In this study, we first quantify the synergies and trade-offs between DPs using a statistical method, and identify influential DPs for solar PV integration using the information gain ratio method. Then, we evaluate the impact of solar PV systems on energy sustainability by considering optimised DPs and energy-economic-environmental decision indicators. Finally, the competitiveness of various solar PV integrated energy systems is analysed using energy, economic, and environmental indicators. The findings suggest that combining solar PV systems with grid power has a greater impact, whereas combining them with battery energy storage systems is more competitive. This study provides valuable insights for decision-making organisations to encourage renewable solar integration in the residential sector, resulting in energy sustainability.

AB Power-to-gas (P2G) facilities use surplus electricity to convert to natural gas in integrated energy systems (IES), increasing the capacity of wind power to be consumed. However, the capacity limitation of P2G and the antipeaking characteristic of wind power make the wind abandonment problem still exist. Meanwhile, the oxygen generated by P2G electrolysis is not fully utilized. Therefore, this study proposes a low-carbon economic dispatch model considering the utilization of hydrogen and oxygen energy. First, the two-stage reaction model of P2G is established, and the energy utilization paths of hydrogen blending and oxygen-rich deep peaking are proposed. Specifically, hydrogen energy is blended into the gas grid to supply gas-fired units, and oxygen assists oxygenrich units into deep peaking. Subsequently, the stochastic optimization is used to deal with the uncertainty of the system, and the objective function and constraints of the IES are given to establish a low-carbon dispatch model under the energy utilization model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified based on the modified IEEE 39-node electric network, 20-node gas network and 6-node heat network models.

AB For the future development of integrated energy systems with high penetration of renewable energy, an integrated community energy systems (ICES) dispatch model is proposed including various renewable energy sources and energy conversion units. Energy coupling matrices of ICES based on traditional energy hub (EH) models are constructed. Uncertainties of long-term forecast data of renewable energy sources and internal loads are depicted by multi-interval uncertainty sets (MIUS). To cope with the impacts caused by uncertainties of renewable energy sources and internal loads, the whole dispatch process is divided into two stages. Considering various constraints of ICES, we solved the dispatch model through the improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm in the first stage. The optimal evolutionary dispatch is then proposed in the second stage to overcome the evolution and errors of short-term forecast data and obtain the optimal dispatch plan. The effectiveness of the proposed dispatch method is demonstrated using an example considering dramatic uncertainties. Compared with the traditional methods, the proposed dispatch method effectively reduces system operating costs and improves the environmental benefits, which helps to achieve a win-win situation for both energy companies and users.

AB This research presents an optimized scheduling model for Integrated Energy Systems (IES) that harmonizes economic efficiency with low carbon emissions in a Real -Time Price (RTP) environment. Integrating a laddertype carbon tax approach, this model adeptly addresses the unpredictability of renewable energy generation and IES load demands. It introduces a carbon trading mechanism for efficient emission control, complemented by an RTP model that manages interactions between the IES and the main power grid through piecewise linear functions. The model also proposes an adaptable operation strategy for thermoelectric and electric cooling ratios, enhancing the IES's economic and operational flexibility. The objective function, crafted on a deviation preference optimization basis, reflects the diverse goals of decision -makers, and the model is skillfully translated into a mixed -integer linear programming format through a series of mathematical transformations. Simulation results demonstrate the model's efficacy in achieving an optimal balance between cost-effectiveness and reliability, particularly by setting a strategic confidence level for spinning reserves. Additionally, incorporating a ladder -type carbon tax and Electric Vehicle (EV) charging within the IES underscores its significant environmental benefits, marking a stride towards a low -carbon future.

AB Hydrogen is considered promising for the replacement of fossil fuels in integrated energy systems through hydrogen energy storage (HES). This paper considers multiple electricity-hydrogen integrated charging stations (EHI-CSs) as a unit consisting of photovoltaic systems and HES systems for charging plug-in electric vehicles and refilling hydrogen fuel vehicles. In the multiple EHI-CSs unit, a set of interconnected EHI-CSs can be supplied by other EHI-CSs or power utilities and an EHI-CSs aggregator can manage the individual EHI-CSs through controllable facilities (i.e., HES system) and adjustment methods (i.e., energy transportation between subsystems). Meanwhile, a two-stage energy management system (EMS) strategy is proposed to coordinate the dayahead scheduling and real-time dispatch. In the day-ahead scheduling stage, the aggregator minimizes the cost of the overall multiple EHI-CSs unit through optimization, and in the real-time dispatching stage, the intraday energy dispatch based model predictive control (MPC) is carried out to minimize the penalty cost. The proposed two-stage EMS strategy is evaluated through simulations and the numerical results confirm that the proposed solution outperforms the baseline solution with additional economic benefit.

AB Increasing interdependency between electric power systems and natural gas systems creates additional dimensions of flexibility of system operation; but it may also escalate risk levels if the two systems are managed without proper coordination. This paper presents a robust security region (RSR) for electricity-gas integrated energy systems (IESs). It is a collection of uncertain parameters, especially wind power generations, under which system power flow has at least one feasible solution. First, a nonlinear optimization model is employed to obtain a set of uniformly distributed points on power flow solvability boundaries, from which the IES security region is constructed using a convex hull. Then, the proposed RSR is constructed to provide secure operation for the base-case scenario, where uncertain wind power generation values are replaced with expected values, and provide a feasible redispatch plan for each wind power generation scenario. Other implications of the RSR on IES security assessment are also envisioned. Results for two test systems indicate that the convex hull approach provides a more accurate approximation of the IES security region than a hyperplane approach. Meanwhile, the benefits of RSR are demonstrated by comparing test results with those obtained for a deterministic security region.

AB Industrial parks, characterized by the clustering of multiple factories and interconnected energy sources, require optimized operational strategies for their Integrated Energy Systems (IES). These strategies not only aim to conserve energy for industrial users but also relieve the burden on the power supply, reducing carbon emissions. In this context, this paper introduces an optimization strategy tailored to clustered factories, considering the incorporation of carbon trading and supply chain integration throughout the entire production process of each factory. First, a workshop model is established for each factory, accompanied by an energy consumption model that accounts for the strict sequencing of the production process and supply chain integration. Furthermore, energy unit models are devised for the IES and then a low-carbon and economically optimized scheduling model is outlined for the IES within the industrial park, aiming to minimize the total operational cost, including the cost of carbon trading. Finally, case studies are conducted within a paper-making industrial park located in the Zhejiang Province. Various scenarios are compared and analyzed. The numerical results underscore the model's economic and low-carbon merits, and it offers technical support for energy conservation and emission reduction in paper-making fields.

AB Improving the utilization of solar energy and promoting the development of integrated energy systems, solar thermal power generation systems are researched and widely used. In the integrated solar combined cycle thermoelectric system, traditional power generation equipment as an auxiliary energy source mitigates fluctuations because of solar energy's intermittent nature and uncertainty. However, because of the difference in response speed of different power generation equipment, it leads to imbalance of supply and demand power, which affects the smooth operation of the system. This paper proposes a novel coordination control method for integrated solar combined cycle thermoelectric coupling system. To solve the different energy response speed mismatches problem, an inertial power compensation scheme is proposed based on the established solar energy cogeneration system model, and the dynamic performance and robustness of the system are improved. In this paper, the intelligent optimization algorithm is used to optimize the parameters to improve the control precision of the controller. Finally, the paper carries out multi-scenario simulation with the 50 MW solar thermal power generation and the 50 MW gas turbine to verify the effectiveness and stability of the proposed coordination control method.

AB Probabilistic energy flow (PEF) calculation is a fundamental task for the operation and planning of both natural gas systems (NGSs) and integrated energy systems considering uncertainties. Traditional Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) based PEF approach requires repeated energy flow calculations based on a large number of random samples, leading to a huge computation burden. Hence, this paper proposes a convex multiparametric programming (MPP) based fast PEF calculation method for NGSs. First, we develop an energy function based convex optimization model whose optimal solution is equivalent to the solution of deterministic energy flow equations. Then, we propose a convex MPP model with uncertain boundary conditions (such as the gas injections/loads) as the parameters. A multiparametric quadratic approximation algorithm is further introduced to solve the proposed MPP and obtain the analytical energy flow expression. This analytical expression characterizes the mapping relationship between the energy flow solution and uncertain parameters. Finally, we establish an online PEF calculation framework, in which the repeat energy flow calculations can be efficiently performed by merely substituting the uncertain parameters into the analytical energy flow expression obtained offline. Case studies on multiple NGSs verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Note to Practitioners-This paper introduces a novel approach for efficient PEF calculation in NGSs that addresses the computational challenges posed by traditional methods. Conventional MCS-based PEF approaches involve numerous energy flow calculations with massive stochastic scenarios, resulting in significant computational burdens. The key contribution of our work is to equivalently reformulate the original PEF problem as an energy function based convex MPP model, which incorporates uncertain boundary conditions (e.g., gas injections/loads) as its parameters. Then, a multiparametric quadratic approximation algorithm is suggested to obtain the parametric solution of this MPP, which is essentially an analytical expression of the energy flow solution as a function of uncertain parameters. This allows for efficient repeated energy flow calculations by simply substituting uncertain parameters into the pre-determined expression obtained offline. Thus, the online PEF computational efficiency can be significantly improved. We conduct case studies on several benchmark NGSs to validate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method. Numerical results show that the online PEF computation efficiency of the proposed method is approximately 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than that of the NR-MCS method.

AB Accurate load forecasting can bring economic benefits and scheduling optimization. The complexity and uncertainty arising from the coupling of different energy sources in integrated energy systems pose challenges for simultaneously predicting multiple target load sequences. Existing data-driven methods for load forecasting in integrated energy systems use multi-task learning to address these challenges. When determining the input data for multi-task learning, existing research primarily relies on data correlation analysis and considers the influence of external environmental factors in terms of feature engineering. However, such feature engineering methods lack the utilization of the characteristics of multi-target sequences. In leveraging the characteristics of multi-target sequences, language generation models trained on textual logic structures and other sequence features can generate synthetic data that can even be applied to self-training to improve model performance. This provides an idea for feature engineering in data-driven time-series forecasting models. However, because time-series data are different from textual data, existing transformer-based language generation models cannot be directly applied to generating time-series data. In order to consider the characteristics of multi-target load sequences in integrated energy system load forecasting, this paper proposed a generative tractive network (GTN) model. By selectively utilizing appropriate autoregressive feature data for temporal data, this model facilitates feature mining from time-series data. This model is capable of analyzing temporal data variations, generating novel synthetic time-series data that align with the intrinsic temporal patterns of the original sequences. Moreover, the model can generate synthetic samples that closely mimic the variations in the original time series. Subsequently, through the integration of the GTN and autoregressive feature data, various prediction models are employed in case studies to affirm the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

AB In recent years, wildfire disasters have become increasingly frequent and severe, presenting significant challenges to power systems. Simultaneously, traditional power systems are evolving into integrated energy systems (IESs). The fluctuation of electric load demand and the uncertainty of renewable generation further complicate the reliability assessment of the IES during wildfire disasters. To address these critical challenges, this study proposes a reliability assessment framework for the IES during wildfire disasters. In this framework, the probability of transmission line failure is modeled by decomposing it into multiple risk factors, and system reliability for a specific failure state is quantified through an optimization model that comprehensively considers both renewable energy utilization and electric load supply. The uncertainty in renewable generation is managed using the third-order polynomial normal transformation (TPNT) and clustering methods. The increasing system scale has also led to challenges in the enumeration calculation of reliability assessment. To address this, we propose an Upper-Lower-Bound Iteration Impact Increment State Enumeration (ULBI-IISE) algorithm, which enhances calculation efficiency by controlling calculation errors. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using the IEEE 118-bus system, with further validation conducted using a practical 500 kV system. Lastly, the impact of scenario uncertainty is thoroughly analyzed, emphasizing its critical role in the reliability assessment of the IES.

AB Multi-regional integrated energy systems (MRIES), which encompass renewable distributed generation (RDG) and electric vehicles (EV) dispersed across multiple regions, are pivotal for promoting low-carbon energy supplies, offering both economic and environmental benefits. However, the complexity introduced by diverse energy conversions and spatiotemporal coupling in MRIES poses significant challenges for energy management. This paper introduces a novel low-carbon energy management framework (EMF) for multi-regional IES, based on spatiotemporal correlations and considering three-dimensional (3D) integrated demand-side response (IDR). The proposed framework employs a novel Cross-Gated Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (CGSTG) to achieve high-precision joint power forecasting separately for the RDG and multi-type loads. In the day-ahead stage, 3D IDR involving flexible loads, e.g., EVs, is considered with multi-regional IES sharing electricity and heat. By engaging in IDR across the temporal (horizontal), spatial (depth), and energy conversion (vertical) dimensions, each IES can enhance its coordinated scheduling capability and operational economy. During the intra-day stage, rolling optimization is performed based on the model predictive control (MPC) framework, incorporating a ladder-type carbon trading mechanism (CTM). Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively reduce operational costs and carbon emissions with significant improvement of coordinated scheduling capability, leading to economic and environmental benefits of MRIES.

AB This paper proposes an optimisation-based framework to tackle long-term centralised planning problems of multi-sector, integrated energy systems including electricity, hydrogen, natural gas, synthetic methane and carbon dioxide. The model selects and sizes the set of power generation, energy conversion and storage as well as carbon capture technologies minimising the cost of supplying energy demand in the form of electricity, hydrogen, natural gas or synthetic methane across the power, heating, transportation and industry sectors whilst accounting for policy drivers, such as energy independence, carbon dioxide emissions reduction targets, or support schemes. The usefulness of the model is illustrated by a case study evaluating the potential of sector coupling via power-to-gas and carbon capture technologies to achieve deep decarbonisation targets in the Belgian context. Results, on the one hand, indicate that power-to-gas can only play a minor supporting role in cross-sector decarbonisation strategies in Belgium, as electrolysis plants are deployed in moderate quantities whilst methanation plants do not appear in any studied scenario. On the other hand, given the limited renewable potential, post-combustion and direct air carbon capture technologies clearly play an enabling role in any decarbonisation strategy, but may also exacerbate the dependence on fossil fuels.

AB A method is proposed to address the challenging issue of load prediction in user-level integrated energy systems (IESs) using a composite VTDS model. Firstly, an IES multi-dimensional load time series is decomposed into multiple intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using variational mode decomposition (VMD). Then, each IMF, along with other influential features, is subjected to data dimensionality reduction and clustering denoising using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and fast density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (FDBSCAN) to perform major feature selection. Subsequently, the reduced and denoised data are reconstructed, and a time-aware long short-term memory (T-LSTM) artificial neural network is employed to fill in missing data by incorporating time interval information. Finally, the selected multi-factor load time series is used as input into a support vector regression (SVR) model optimized using the quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm for load prediction. Using measured load data from a specific user-level IES at the Tempe campus of Arizona State University, USA, as a case study, a comparative analysis between the VTDS method and other approaches is conducted. The results demonstrate that the method proposed in this study achieved higher accuracy in short-term forecasting of the IES's multiple loads.

AB With the increasing penetration of renewable energy, the Power-to-hydrogen technology accelerates the adoption of new energy vehicles, including both hydrogen vehicles (HV) and electric vehicles (EV). Simultaneously, the integration of Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology further promotes the development of electric-hydrogen integrated energy systems coupled with transportation systems. In this study, an optimal scheduling model is developed for an EV-HV coupled electric-hydrogen integrated energy system, taking into account V2G response and carbon trading. Firstly, to address the randomness of renewable energy and loads, the Latin hypercube sampling method in conjunction with the Kantorovich scenario reduction method, is employed for scenario generation and simplification. Secondly, an optimization model is developed for the operation of hydrogenblended gas turbines and the energy management of EVs and HVs. To encourage the participation of EVs and HVs, a reward mechanism for V2G responses is introduced, complemented by a time-of-use tariff, to guide orderly charging and discharging. Furthermore, the influence of the operating modes of EVs and HVs, as well as the hydrogen blending ratio, on the total system cost and carbon emissions is examined. An industrial park is selected as an illustrative example to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating satisfied economic and environmental performances.

AB The interconnection and coupling of integrated energy systems (IES) including electricity system, natural gas system and district heating system become increasingly tight. It brings opportunities for improving energy consumption efficiency as well as challenges on security interactions. Thus, the concepts of the IES security region (SR), which considers all the essential operational constraints of IES (including voltage magnitude constraint, thermal constraint, gas pressure constraint, gas transmission constraint, and temperature constraint), are discussed in this paper. These concepts stem from the ideas of power system security regions and are expanded to the multi-dimensional IES involving the limits and parameters of electricity, natural gas, and district heating networks. A set of optimization models are developed to explore the SR boundaries (SRBs) in the IES. Also, a piecewise approximation is proposed to represent the SRB of IES in a multi-dimensional space with a minimum set of hyperplanes. After that, the potential implementations of SR for security assessment and optimal control in the IES are presented and analyzed. Numerical results from the IES 30-20-2 x 6 system demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method and verifies that it can significantly enhance the situation awareness ability of the IES.

AB Demand response (DR) is a crucial element in the optimization of integrated energy systems (IESs) that incorporate distributed generation (DG). However, its inherent uncertainty poses significant challenges to the economic viability of IESs. This research presents a novel economic dispatch model for IESs utilizing information gap decision theory (IGDT). The model integrates various components to improve IES performance and dispatch efficiency. With a focus on hydrogen energy, the model considers users' energy consumption patterns, thereby improving system flexibility. By applying IGDT, the model effectively addresses the uncertainty associated with DR and DG, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods. The research findings indicate that in relation to the baseline method, the proposed model has the potential to reduce operating costs by 6.3 % and carbon emissions by 4.2 %. The integration of a stepwise carbon trading mechanism helps boost both economic and environmental advantages, achieving a 100 % wind power consumption rate in the optimized plan. In addition, the daily operating costs are minimized to 23,758.99 & YEN;, while carbon emissions are significantly reduced to 34,192 kg. These findings provide quantitative decision support for IES dispatch planners to help them develop effective dispatch strategies that are consistent with low-carbon economic initiatives.

AB In the context of the current sharing economy, the application of shared energy storage (SES) among local integrated energy systems (LIESs) is underexplored. There is an urgent need for developing appropriate modeling and solution methods so as to facilitate the application of SES among LIESs. To this end, this paper proposes a cooperative-game-based day-ahead scheduling model of LIESs with SES. The proposed model can be transformed into a sequential two-step optimization problem for alleviating the computational complexity. More specifically, the subproblem of cooperative alliance profit maximization is established in the first step to obtain the optimal scheduling strategies of each LIES, while the subproblem of SES bargaining is constructed in the second step to obtain the optimal pricing information. Besides, a distributed solution algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers with a warm start and dual update accelerated iteration strategies (ADMM-W-D) is proposed to effectively preserve the privacy of each LIES and improve the convergence performance of traditional ADMM. Case studies show that the proposed model can achieve lower operating costs and higher renewable energy consumption levels of LIESs after considering SES. It is also demonstrated that the proposed algorithm based on ADMM-W-D has stronger convergence and better scalability than traditional algorithms.

AB With the growing concern for the environment, sustainable development centred on a low-carbon economy has become a unifying pursuit for the energy industry. Integrated energy systems (IES) that combine multiple energy sources such as electricity, heat and gas are essential to facilitate the consumption of renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emission. In this paper, gas turbine (GT), carbon capture and storage (CCS) and power-to-gas (P2G) device are introduced to construct a new carbon capture coupling device model, GT-CCS-P2G (GCCP), which is applied to the integrated electrical and gas system (IEGS). Multi-agent soft actor critic (MASAC) applies historical trajectory representations, parameter spatial techniques and deep densification frameworks to reinforcement learning for reducing the detrimental effects of time-series data on the decisional procedure. The energy scheduling problem of IEGS is redefined as a Markov game, which is addressed by adopting a low carbon economic control framework based on MASAC with minimum operating cost and minimum carbon emission as the optimization objectives. To validate the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed low-carbon economy scheduling model of IEGS based on MASAC, this paper simulates and analyses in integrated PJM-5 node system and seven nodes natural gas system.

AB Carbon capture systems and the utilization of renewable energy are key ways to reduce carbon emissions, but their uncertainty seriously affects the stable operation and economic efficiency of power systems. To tackle this challenge, a low-carbon economic scheduling model for microgrid electric-thermal integrated energy systems(IES) considering uncertainties is proposed in this paper. The model suggests an ideal dispatch of the IES system that accounts for the disruption of the carbon capture system's integration into the grid belt and plans for the carbon capture plant's low carbon features. Mechanisms for operating and scheduling systems couple wind energy with carbon capture power plants. These mechanisms also invoke demand response resources on the load side. The system's low carbon performance is increased through cooperative source-load resource optimization. A well-established industrial automation optimal dispatch model is developed using YALMIP and CPLEX. The results show that this method is helpful to solve the problem of system adaptability and seek a balance between low-carbon and economy. When considering uncertainties, the ability to resist risks of the system is improved, but the cost will increase by about 3%\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\%$$\end{document}.

AB Microgrids create conditions for efficient use of integrated energy systems containing renewable energy sources. One of the major challenges in the control and operation of microgrids is managing the fluctuating renewable energy generation, as well as sudden load changes that can affect system frequency and voltage stability. To solve the above problems, hierarchical control techniques have received wide attention. At present, although some progress has been made in hierarchical control systems using classical control, machine learning-based approaches have shown promising features and performance in the control and operation management of microgrids. This paper reviews not only the application of classical control in hierarchical control systems in the last five years of references, but also the application of machine learning techniques. The survey also provides a comprehensive description of the use of different machine learning algorithms at different control levels, with a comparative analysis for their control methods, advantages and disadvantages, and implementation methods from multiple perspectives. The paper also presents the structure of primary and secondary control applications utilizing machine learning technology. In conclusion, it is highlighted that machine learning in microgrid hierarchical control can enhance control accuracy and address system optimization concerns. However, challenges, such as computational intensity, the need for stability analysis, and experimental validation, remain to be addressed.

AB The reliability evaluation of integrEated energy systems becomes very important, because it is the basis of planning and operation. However, different stakeholders in integrated energy systems bring difficulty to evaluation process due to data privacy protect. In this paper, a reliability evaluation approach for multi-agent integrated energy systems via fully distributed communication is presented. Firstly, a reliability evaluation model of multi-agent integrated energy systems is established, where wind turbines, plug-in electric vehicles and gas storages are considered in the structure. Moreover, a re-dispatching model with voltage and gas pressure constraints is presented to minimize operation cost, when a contingent incident happens. Through second-order cone and Big M relaxation, the re-dispatching model is reformulated to a solvable one. Furthermore, a state assessment method with fully distributed communication is proposed to reduce information exchange, which is presented based on Monte Carlo simulation and alternating direction method of multipliers with Gaussian back substitution. Reliability indices of each agent and whole system can be calculated via a little non-privacy message transferring. Finally, the proposed model and approach are tested on a modified MA-IES. The relevant failure among different sub-systems is analyzed and the effectiveness of fully distributed communication is validated.

AB Retired electric vehicle batteries (REVBs) retain substantial energy storage capacity, holding great potential for utilization in integrated energy systems. However, the dynamics of supply and demand, alongside battery safety constraints, present challenges to the optimal dispatch of energy. This paper proposes a hybrid system including thermal and electric energy employing REVB as the energy storage component. This system relies on photovoltaics (PV) technology to harness solar energy and convert it into thermal and electrical energy for supplying users. The REVB, as the core component of the system, functions to regulate the allocation of energy by managing its charging and discharging behavior. To explore the optimal energy scheduling strategy, a two-stage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) optimization method is presented. In the first phase, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method is introduced to determine the REVB's behavior, and in the second phase, a competitive bidding mechanism is presented to optimally distribute energy. Simulation results, validated with real scenarios and data, achieve a reduction of 35.2 % in energy dissipation and 4.6 % in users' expenditure for purchasing energy compared to standard strategy. Simultaneously, experiments have shown that REVB is nearly as efficient as new battery as energy storage component, with energy wastage only about 1.1 % higher and users' expenditure less than 1 % higher.

TI Distributionally robust planning for integrated energy systems
   incorporating electric-thermal demand response
SO ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
ID WIND POWER; MODEL
AB Demand response (DR) can achieve the optimal planning of integrated energy systems (IESs) for improving the economic performance and sustainable development of IESs. However, the integration of renewable energy imposes great uncertainties on IESs planning. In this context, electric-thermal DR is implemented to maximize the net annual profit during the planning period of electric-thermal IES. For avoiding the new electric load peak, electric price-based DR is modified by integrating the peak-valley difference constraint and cost. Meanwhile, the inertia of thermal loads measured by the predicted mean vote (PMV) is considered as the thermal DR measure. In order to deal with uncertainties of wind power, distributionally robust optimization (DRO) method is developed. Especially, the first- and second-moment uncertainties of wind power are considered in the uncertainty set. Further, based on the conditional value at risk (CVaR) and duality theories, the DRO planning model is reformulated to a tractable second order conic programming problem. Finally, the whole planning model is solved by the CPLEX solver. Case studies and comparative analysis are performed based on a representative test system. Numerical results show that the proposed model is effective in improving the net annual profit and solution robustness, and it significantly outperforms other methods. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Under the background of "carbon peak and carbon neutrality", the interconnection of multiple regional integrated energy systems has become an important way to coordinate multiple energy sources and save energy and reduce emissions. This paper proposes a low-carbon economic dispatch model for multi-regional integrated energy systems considering the joint demand response mechanism; first, the concept and model of joint demand response are proposed, and on this basis, the energy conversion model between multiple energy forms in the multi-regional integrated energy system is studied; secondly, green certificate trading and carbon trading mechanisms are introduced, and green certificate trading and carbon trading are combined through the green certificate emission reduction mechanism; finally, a low-carbon economic dispatch model is proposed with the goal of minimizing the sum of system energy purchase cost, green certificate trading cost, carbon trading cost and joint demand response compensation cost. The example results show that the introduction of joint demand response mechanism and green certificate-carbon trading mechanism in the multi-regional integrated energy system reduces the total system cost and carbon emissions by 14.03% and 26.04% respectively.

AB To address the challenges posed by the randomness and volatility of multi-energy loads in integrated energy systems for ultra-short-term accurate load forecasting, this paper proposes an ultra-short-term multi-energy load forecasting method based on multi-dimensional coupling feature mining and multi-task learning. Firstly, a method for mining multi-dimensional coupling characteristics of multi-energy loads is proposed, integrating multiple correlation analysis methods. By constructing coupling features of multi-energy loads and using them as input features of the model, the complex coupling relationships between multi-energy loads are effectively quantified. Secondly, an ultra-short-term multi-energy load forecasting model based on multi-task learning and a temporal convolutional network is constructed. In the prediction model construction phase, the potential complex coupling characteristics between multiple loads can be fully explored, and the potential temporal associations and long-term dependencies within data can be extracted. Then, the multi-task learning loss function weight optimization method based on homoscedastic uncertainty is used to optimize the forecasting model, realizing automatic tuning of the loss function weight parameters and further improving the prediction performance of the model. Finally, an experimental analysis is conducted using the integrated energy system of Arizona State University in the United States as an example. The results show that the proposed forecasting method has higher prediction accuracy than other prediction methods.

AB Incentive-based integrated demand response (IDR) has been recognized as a powerful tool to mitigate supply-demand imbalance in integrated energy systems with high penetration of distributed renewable energy sources (RESs). However, incomplete information as well as demand-side substitute and complementary effect (S&C effect)-the change in demand for a type of energy carrier as a result of a change in the relative incentive rates of other kind of energy carriers-have been central challenges to estimate accurately the response behavior of consumers. This paper proposed an improved incentive-based IDR model to effectively cope with the S&C effect and incomplete information. Besides, both output uncertainty of RESs and responsiveness uncertainty of consumers are taken into account, with an improved model of energy storage unit to deal with balancing power deviation and measure corresponding risk costs caused by the uncertainties. The proposed IDR model is formulated as a bi-level stochastic programming problem, which is converted equivalently into a nonlinear convex optimization problem to solve it efficiently. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method to cope with the S&C effect and incomplete information, verifying merits of the model in reducing both comfort loss of consumers and the total cost/risk cost of multi-energy aggregator (MEA), decreasing balancing power deviation, enhancing MEA's ability of risk management, and promoting calculation efficiency.

AB Multi-stakeholder participation is crucial in facilitating the development of park-integrated energy systems (PIES). Balancing the diverse interests of various stakeholders, each with its distinct requirements presents a notable challenge. Concurrently, the model's complexity increases due to the engagement of various stakeholders, posing challenges to its resolution through traditional methods. In this context, this paper aims to investigate an optimal scheduling model that incorporates shared energy storage (SES) system, microgrids operator (MGO), electric vehicles station (EVS), and user aggregator (UA) with multiple prosumers. To comprehensively address the interests of all stakeholders, this study introduces a tri-level optimization model. The proposed model integrates a bidirectional Stackelberg-Nash game framework, in which the SES acts as the leader, the MGO acts as the secondary leader, and the UA-EVS acts as the followers while allocating benefits based on the asymmetric Nash bargaining theory. The Stackelberg game model between MGO and UA-EVS is analyzed using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition, while the Stackelberg game model between SES and MGO is resolved using the bisection method. Meanwhile, the Nash bargaining method among users is solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) technique. The analysis indicates that the proposed strategy can reduce PIES's costs and carbon emissions, yielding a win-win situation for all stakeholders.

AB In the realm of economic scheduling and optimal operation within integrated energy systems, integrated energy load aggregation plays a pivotal role. Accurate prediction of integrated energy load aggregation enables the refined management of energy resources, thereby enhancing energy utilization efficiency. This paper merges the advantages of clustering algorithms, prediction algorithms and ensemble learning to propose a short-term prediction approach for integrated energy load aggregation. Firstly, the intrinsic distribution of energy consumption data is analyzed through Affinity Propagation (AP) clustering with multi-dimensional similarity. This analysis yields the division of all samples into clusters based on data characteristics. Subsequently, the Transfer entropy is harnessed to conduct correlation analysis within each cluster. For constructing predictive models for each individual cluster, a prediction algorithm based on the Feature-Temporal Attention-enhanced Bi-directional Simple Recurrent Unit (FTA-Bi-SRU) is employed. The Dynamic Weight Average (DWA)-based multi-task loss equilibrium and Multi-Term Adam (MTAdam) loss function are combined to enhance the efficiency of the forecasting model. Finally, a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model with Bayesian optimization is employed to integrate the predictive outcomes of each individual cluster to generate the overall predictive outcomes for integrated energy load aggregation. The proposed methodology is experimented on real-world energy consumption data to ascertain the efficacy of the prediction method. The experimental results substantiate the superiority of the suggested forecasting approach.

AB Multi-energy load forecasting is essential for energy management and scheduling optimization in Integrated Energy Systems. To address the challenges posed by the complex coupling, non-linearity, and significant load fluctuations among multi-energy loads, this paper proposes the Empirical Mode Decomposition-Mixture-of-Experts-Mamba-Attention forecasting model, which considers local features. In the feature engineering phase, this study employs correlation analysis to select key influencing factors, thereby reducing the interference of irrelevant factors. It also uses Empirical Mode Decomposition to decompose the highly complex load data, extracting components at different frequencies to effectively reduce the influence of non-linearity and noise. Furthermore, the decomposed load signals are reconstructed to extract clearer signals, providing a solid foundation for subsequent forecasting. In the forecasting model, this study introduces the Mixture-of-Experts-Mamba-Attention framework. This model employs a Mixture-of-Experts approach to simultaneously forecast cooling, heating, and electrical loads, with the Gating network dynamically assigning different weights to enhance forecasting accuracy. Additionally, the Mamba-Attention mechanism strengthens the model's ability to capture local features through a multi-level structure. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance metrics for cooling, heating, and electrical loads significantly outperform traditional methods, with MAPE values of 2.35 %, 2.02 %, and 2.67 %, respectively. These results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model.

AB Hydrogen is an energy vector and is produced just like electricity. In order to overcome the shortcomings associated with its low molecular weight and energy density per unit volume, hydrogen is liquefied for storage and transportation purposes. The liquefaction of hydrogen differs from that of other substances as it involves the reactive transformation of its isomeric states. At 25 & DEG;C, molecular hydrogen consists of 75% orthohydrogen and 25% of parahydrogen. As the normal boiling point, hydrogen essentially exists in the para-state, which is preferred because of its lower boil-off gas rate. However, the conversion of ortho-to-para hydrogen is an exothermic reaction, and this enthalpy of conversion enhances the total reversible work by about 15%. Little work has been done regarding orthoto-para hydrogen conversion from the process systems point of view. Therefore, parametric analysis of this vital conversion reaction was studied with potential impact on the performance of cryogenic heat exchangers, reactors configuration and mode of operation, and probable impact on the energy efficiency of the liquefaction process. An alternate approach to simulate the reaction is also proposed. The results show that the current approaches to process design need to be changed. The study opens avenues for more indepth analysis and optimization approaches to present a holistic framework for future integrated energy systems.& COPY; 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

DT Article

   Wavelet packet decomposition
AB Multi-energy load forecasting is the basis for the optimization and scheduling of integrated energy systems (IES). An IES contains much heterogeneous energy with volatility and temporality, and complex coupling relationships between the energy sources, which makes it difficult to accurately predict multiple loads simultaneously. Considering these issues, this paper proposes a bi-level multi-task learning (BiMTL) method for simultaneous sequence signal prediction and reconstruction via deep neural networks. In the feature construction process, considering the volatility and randomness of the load, the improved wavelet packet decomposition model is constructed to decompose the multiple load sequences into sub-signal with more obvious signal characteristics, and improves the ability of the forecasting model to capture and respond to the fluctuations of load sequences within a local range. In the modeling process, considering the excessive dependence of traditional signal reconstruction methods on the prediction results of sub-bands, this paper innovatively proposes a BiMTL method. This method employs a second-layer shared learning to perform signal reconstruction and error correction on the output of the first layer's sub-band predictions. Finally, a BiMTLLSTM model is constructed to extract the coupling and temporality of loads based on the LSTM hard-sharing mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods on the widely used Tempe dataset, achieving an accuracy of up to 98.70%.

AB The progressive development of the integrated energy system and the continuous reform of the electrical markets will lead to a gradual diffusion for the multi-energy coupling from the physical level to the market level. This gradual transformation will impose serious market challenges, and hence, proper pricing methods for integrated energy systems form one of the most essential requirements. This paper proposes a two-stage iterative clearing mechanism of an integrated electricity-heat-gas market considering integrated demand response (IDR). A market-clearing optimization model of an integrated electricity-heat-gas system based on the generalized locational marginal price (GLMP) is established for the first stage of market-clearing. Furthermore, GLMPs are decomposed to analyze the influencing factors and correlation. For the second stage, the elastic coefficient is utilized to model IDR, which includes the single energy demand response and the multi-energy alternative demand response. The load curves are acquired after an integrated demand response, and the two stages are iteratively executed until the load change is less than the threshold value. The proposed mechanism is verified on a test case. The decomposition results of GLMPs are elaborated, and the numerical results show that the clearing mechanism considering elastic load can reduce price spikes and the cost of purchasing energy.

AB Integrated Energy Cluster (IEC), the regional aggregation of integrated energy systems (IES), has accumulated plenty of dispatchable resources with the development of energy market. This, while significantly providing system Demand Response (DR) potential, also complicates the interaction of the IEC with the main grid and increases the difficulty of system scheduling. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning- driven multi-agent hierarchical regulation framework that makes full use of DR to maximize the benefits of both IEC and main grid. Firstly, in the context of the DR market, a mechanism for IECs to bid in the real-time DR market is proposed. Furthermore, an "IEC-main network" hierarchical regulation model taking account of DR is established to minimize the IEC operation cost and maximize the societal benefit. Moreover, an optimization algorithm utilizing Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) with Multi-process (MP) and Priority Experience Replay (PER) mechanism is proposed to allow adaptability to high-latitude and large-scale applications. In case study, the proposed model and algorithm is tested on an 8-node system and a 24-node system. The result indicates that the hierarchical regulation model considering DR can improve the system economy by 2.59 % than that without DR and the improved DDPG algorithm can enhance training effectiveness in comparison with DDPG and PER-DDPG.

AB In optimal dispatch (OD) of multiple integrated energy systems (MIES), purely data-driven reinforcement learning (RL) methods often encounter challenges such as transient data boundaries, robustness, and interpretability. For this problem, this paper proposes a multi-agent physics-informed reinforcement learning (MAPIRL) method for MIES optimal dispatch. MAPIRL analytically integrates safety constraints using hyperbolic tangent functions, implementing a physics-informed learning process that enforce these constraints within the actor networks. The well-trained MAPIRL can achieve highly generalized real-time decision making. The MAPIRL method is compared with none-physics-based classical RL in a MIES market. The results demonstrate that MAPIRL not only facilitates highly safe and reliable dispatch decisions but also surpasses other methods in convergence efficiency. Additionally, embedding physics knowledge enhances the interpretability for the intelligent OD process.

This paper presents a general framework of integrated energy systems. Elements of the concept of integrated energy systems are suggested. The explanation of the concept elements is given as a three-layer structure of integrated energy systems in three dimensions. The problems of integrated control of electric and heat networks deal with issues of combined calculation of operating conditions of the electric and heat networks integrated in the intelligent energy supply system. A mathematical description of the problems is presented. The results of two illustrative case studies are shown and explained. The first case study represents research on an emergency situation at the supergrid level of the energy system layers after an accident on a pipeline of the gas transportation network. The second case study represents research of interdependency of power and heat supply minigrids in emergency conditions on the example of a city district. Preferable future work is discussed.

AB With the revolution of traditional economic and social patterns based on concentrated fossil energy intensive consumption, regional integrated energy systems (RIES) have gradually become an important trend for future energy consumption. As an important technical means of integrated energy demand side management, demand response helps to improve the smooth and reliable operation of the integrated energy system (IES). Meanwhile, it is of great significance to improve national energy security and the environment. This paper focuses on the demand response evaluation of RIES based on improved matter element extension model. Firstly, with the introduction of the RIES demand response evaluation mechanism, the demand response index system of RIES is established from five dimensions: user load, user energy usage, user energy reliability, user energy consumption, and user energy habits. Based on the demand response evaluation index system, the potential demand response users of the integrated energy system are graded into four levels: rewarded user (I), encouraged user (II), general user (III), and non-encouraged user (IV).Secondly, based on the analytic hierarchy process and entropy method to obtain more accurate comprehensive weights, the RIES demand response evaluation model is established by the matter-element extension method. Finally, in order to illustrate the advantages of this method, 10 objects were selected from the regional integrated energy systems demand response project of a Chinese city for evaluation and analysis. The results show that the demand response abilities of the 10 evaluation objects are all at level I, indicating that the automatic demand response (ADR) of 10 evaluation objects is good.

AB It is anticipated that the decarbonisation of the entire energy system will require the introduction of large shares of variable renewable electricity generation into the power system. Long term integrated energy systems models are useful in improving our understanding of decarbonisation but they struggle to take account of short term variations in the power system associated with increased variable renewable energy penetration. This can oversimplify the ability of power systems to accommodate variable renewables and result in mistaken signals regarding the levels of flexibility required in power systems. Capturing power system impacts of variability within integrated energy system models is challenging due to temporal and technical simplifying assumptions needed to make such models computationally manageable. This paper addresses a gap in the literature by reviewing prominent methodologies that have been applied to address this challenge and the advantages & limitations of each. The methods include soft linking between integrated energy systems models and power systems models and improving the temporal and technical representation of power systems within integrated energy systems models. Each methodology covered approaches the integration of short term variations and assesses the flexibility of the system differently. The strengths, limitations, and applicability of these different methodologies are analysed. This review allows users of integrated energy systems models to select a methodology (or combination of methodologies) to suit their needs. In addition, the analysis identifies remaining gaps and shortcomings.

ID UNIT COMMITMENT; DESIGN
AB Unit commitment (UC) is a key player in the coordinated operation of integrated energy systems. However, the participation of multiple market entities with widely different characteristics in large-scale energy systems has urged the critical need for the application of a distributed scheme to the UC problem. The NP-hard UC problem is a challenging mixed-integer programming problem. The presence of a large number of binary variables in the UC subproblems, which are solved by each participating entity after implementing the UC decomposition, fails to guarantee the convergence and the optimality of existing solution methods. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a distributed method, using logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD), for the UC problem in a typical multi-entity system, i.e., integrated electric and heating system (IEHS). By searching the branch and bound tree of the district heating system (DHS) subproblem, the lower bound of its objective function is rigorously derived as a valid Benders cut to ensure the convergence to global optimal results. This distributed method is suitable for both deterministic and robust UC solutions. Numerical simulations are conducted on two test systems to demonstrate the performance of the proposed model and its distributed solution method.

AB Carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems can provide sufficient carbon raw materials for power-to-gas (P2G) systems to reduce the carbon emission of traditional coal-fired units, which helps to achieve low-carbon dispatch of integrated energy systems (IESs). In this study, an extended carbon-emission flow model that integrates CCS-P2G coordinated operation and low-carbon characteristics of an energy storage system (ESS) is proposed. On the energy supply side, the coupling relationship between CCS and P2G systems is established to realize the low-carbon economic operation of P2G systems. On the energy storage side, the concept of "state of carbon" is introduced to describe the carbon emission characteristics of the ESS to exploit the potential of coordinated low-carbon dispatch in terms of both energy production and storage. In addition, a low-carbon economic dispatch model that considers multiple uncertainties, including wind power output, electricity price, and load demands, is established. To solve the model efficiently, a parallel multidimensional approximate dynamic programming algorithm is adopted, while the solution efficiency is significantly improved over that of stochastic optimization without losing solution accuracy under a multilayer parallel loop nesting framework. The low-carbon economic dispatch method of IESs is composed of the extended carbon emission flow model, low-carbon economic dispatch model, and the parallel multidimensional approximate dynamic programming algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on E14-B6-G6 and E57-B12-G12 systems.

   bargaining; Park-level integrated energy system
AB Due to energy shortage and environmental degradation issues, great efforts have been devoted to optimize the operation of PIES considering the carbon emission reduction. This paper proposes an enhanced dispatch scheme for park-level integrated energy systems (PIESs) with the consideration of electricity-carbon collaboration, which aims to address the issues in existing carbon trading mechanisms. For example, they fail to reflect the competitive relationships among multiple interest subjects in markets and carbon emission reduction potential in PIESs has been significantly underestimated. Firstly, an extended carbon emission flow model considering dynamic characteristics in PIESs is developed so that the carbon emission responsibility could be allocated optimally and the carbon emission reduction potential in PIESs could be fully explored. Then, a quadratic carbon emission intensity pricing mechanism for nodes within PIES is proposed, where the spatio-temporal difference is fully utilized to optimize the demand response through electricity price. Meanwhile, based on the cooperative game theory, a collaborative bargaining mechanism among multiple PIESs is established, where the competitive relationships among multiple interest subjects in the carbon market are captured through the Nash bargaining. Finally, the modified PR-ADMM and two-stage robust optimization are adopted to increase the computing efficiency. The case study results show that, with the proposed dispatch scheme, the operating cost of PIESs can be reduced by 15.69 % while the overall carbon emissions can be reduced by 12.21 %.

AB The network trend of isolated communities adds urgency to accelerate the deployment of community integrated energy systems (CIES). CIES effectively combines and optimizes multiple energy systems, leveraging their complementarity for efficient utilization and economical energy supply. However, the escalating intricacies of coupling multiple energy sources and the rising system uncertainties both pose challenges to flexibility scheduling of energy supply and demand. Additionally, the potential flexibility of building thermal inertia and pipeline gas linepack in diverse CIES, encompassing residential, commercial, and industrial communities, remains unexplored. To tackle these issues, a stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) based multi-temporal-spatial-scale flexibility scheduling strategy considering multiple uncertainty sources and system inertia components is proposed. First, the optimization model of CIES is formulated to improve operational flexibility and efficiency, resolve energy discrepancies and expand the capacity for renewable energy utilization. Then, the SMPC-based framework embedding an auto-regressive model and scenario generation method are established to make real-time corrections to the day-ahead scheduling stage and offset the prediction errors of uncertainty sources economically. Furthermore, thermal inertia of the aggregated buildings with different envelopes and linepack in gas pipelines are both leveraged to enhance the flexibility and synergy of CIES. Finally, a case study is executed to verify the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed strategy. The simulation results unequivocally demonstrate that this strategy successfully coordinates and harnesses complementary advantages from various energy sources, fostering a balanced energy supply-demand equilibrium across multiple temporal and spatial scales.

AB With a background of carbon peak and neutrality, the economic and environmental requirements are increasing for microgrids. In view of the problem of energy wastage and conflicts of interest among multiple microgrid integrated energy systems, it is important to study the operation optimization of microgrid clusters while considering the sharing and trading of both carbon emissions and green certificates. In this study, a Stackelberg game mechanism is applied, in which the microgrid operator is the leader and its subscribers are the followers, forming a master-slave interaction model. Following this, breaking the trading barriers of energy and various policy markets, the joint carbon and green certificate trading mechanism is proposed. Moreover, a mutually beneficial shared trading model of multi-microgrids considering coupled energy and carbon and green certificate trading is proposed to avoid the problem of double counting of environmental attributes. In addition, a cooperative sharing center is assumed to propose a flexible multi-resource sharing price mechanism. It guides each microgrid operator to conduct internal multi-resource sharing trading, so as to reduce the daily operating costs of energy supplying entities in the cooperative system of multiple microgrids, effectively reduce carbon emissions, and improve the balance of network group mutual aid. According to the simulation results of an illustrative example, the proposed trading strategy can effectively unlock the potential of resource sharing and mutual aid within multi-microgrids and improve the economy and carbon reduction effects of the overall system.

AB Accurate load forecasting is crucial to the stable operation of integrated energy systems (IES), which plays a significant role in advancing sustainable development. Addressing the challenge of insufficient prediction accuracy caused by the inherent uncertainty and volatility of load data, this study proposes a multi-energy load forecasting method for IES using an improved VMD-TCN-BiLSTM model. The proposed model consists of optimizing the Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) parameters through a mathematical model based on minimizing the average permutation entropy (PE). Moreover, load sequences are decomposed into different Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) using VMD, with the optimal number of models determined by the average PE to reduce the non-stationarity of the original sequences. Considering the coupling relationship among electrical, thermal, and cooling loads, the input features of the forecasting model are constructed by combining the IMF set of multi-energy loads with meteorological data and related load information. As a result, a hybrid neural network structure, integrating a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) with a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network for load prediction is developed. The Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (SCSO) algorithm is employed to obtain the optimal hyper-parameters of the TCN-BiLSTM model. A case analysis is performed using the Arizona State University Tempe campus dataset. The findings demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform six other existing models in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Coefficient of Determination (R2), verifying its effectiveness and superiority in load forecasting.

AB To reduce carbon, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions from the integrated energy system (IES), a low carbon optimization strategy for the IES is proposed, taking into account carbon, SO2 and NOX emissions. Firstly, hydrogen production, storage and use equipment such as methane reactor, electrolysis tank, hydrogen fuel cell and hydrogen energy storage are added to the traditional IES to build a multi-energy complementary system of electricity, gas, cooling, thermal and hydrogen. Then this paper introduces a stepped carbon trading mechanism and the model of the emissions of SO2 and NOX. Finally, to further reduce its pollutant emissions, the model of combined heat and power units and hydrogen fuel cells with adjustable thermoelectric ratio is built. To compare and account for the impact of air pollutant emissions on the optimal low-carbon operation of IES, this paper construsted three scenarios, with the lowest cost of carbon trading, the lowest penalty cost for SO2 and NOX emissions and total operation cost as objective functions respectively The results show that the strategy is effective in reducing air pollutant emissions from integrated energy systems and the outputs of CHP and HFC with adjustable thermoelectric ratios are more flexible and can effectively achieve carbon reduction and pollutant emission reduction.

AB In the context of green grid, it is crucial to enhance the low-carbon transformation of integrated energy systems. To improve the degree of low-carbon in these systems, this paper proposes an optimal allocation method of oxygen enriched combustion-carbon capture low-carbon integrated energy system considering the uncertainty of carbon-source-load. Firstly, this paper provides an analysis of uncertainties of carbon-source-load and uses budget uncertainty sets to model the three uncertain parameters. Secondly, in the integrated energy system, the by-product O-2 of hydrogen production by electrocution and the oxygen storage device are used to provide oxygen-enriched combustion conditions for the gas turbine to reduce the CO2 generated in the combustion process. At the same time, the carbon capture device is used to collect CO2, and the oxygen enriched combustion-carbon capture integrated energy system is formed. Finally, an improved multi-populations quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the proposed model. This method considers the uncertainty of carbon emission intensity, which makes the optimal allocation of integrated energy system more inclined to low-carbon rather than economic. In addition, in terms of model structure, this method integrates oxygen enriched combustion-carbon capture into the integrated energy system to form a low-carbon model, which directly improves the low-carbon performance of the system. The simulation results show that the carbon emission of the proposed method is reduced by 38.8 % compared with other methods.

AB The emergence of energy hubs as integrated energy systems has been a recent development that has the potential to shape the future of the global energy landscape. This article delves into the issue of collaborative economic planning for multiple interconnected energy systems by utilizing the energy hub. In contrast to the conventional non-collaborative methodology of independent operation of each energy hub, the present approach entails the formation of an interdependent community of energy hubs that facilitates the exchange of energy resources. The issue of coordinated management, taking into account the autonomy and individual interests of distinct energy hubs, is conceptualized as a collaborative bargaining game. In this game, the energy hubs involved engage in negotiations with one another regarding the exchange of energy and the associated costs. The collaborative system's bargaining response is determined through the implementation of a distributed optimization approach. This is performed to ensure that the energy hubs' scheduling autonomy and confidentiality of information are maintained. The modeling of uncertainties in forecasting the output power of renewable energy resources and electric demand is a well-known challenge. This study employs the information gap decision-making theory to handle this challenge. Specifically, the study presents a robust bargaining game theory algorithm for energy hubs' optimum and robust operation. The simulation outcomes have ultimately verified the efficacy of the energy hub's collaborative economic planning algorithm that relies on bargaining for energy management, even in uncertainty.

AB In this manuscript, the energy trading model is proposed for investigating the cooperative benefits between several electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) and integrated energy systems (IES) based on hybrid system. The proposed hybrid system is combination of Radial-Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) and artificial transgender longicorn algorithm (ATLA), hence it is called RBFNN-ATLA technique. Initially, the RBFNN approach manages the energy between IES and EVCSs. After that, the original issue breaks down into the main energy trade and payment negotiation issue. The energy trading issue and payment negotiation problem can be solved using ATLA approach. This proposed structure may not only diminish the IES cost, however also enlarge the EVCS profit. The uncertainties in electricity and renewable energy prices are modeled using a robust optimization technique. Additionally, the integrated demand response is modeled for maximizing operational performance. The distributed algorithm depends on the proposed technique is evolved for solving the issue of energy trading, ensuring the privacy of players. The proposed algorithm may obtain the global optimal solutions devoid of adjusting the parameter compared with existing algorithm. The proposed system is performed by the matrix laboratory (MATLAB)/Simulink and the performance is evaluated with other existing methods. The RBFNN-ATLA method reduces the cost up to 3.76%, 7.793%, 8.210% and 9.01% for independent and cooperative mode. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that the proposed system can accurately detect that optimal global solution.

AB The continued promotion of diversified energy utilization has put forward higher requirements for the regulation ability of integrated energy systems. The flexible ability of demand side resources makes it an important means of regulating energy utilization efficiency. However, the current demand response economic compensation standards mostly use fixed empirical values, which may not fully motivate users to participate in demand response. Therefore, an optimized operation strategy for integrated electricity-gas energy system considering stepped incentives demand response was proposed. Firstly, by introducing dynamic compensation mechanism, a demand response model based on step incentives is modeled, and it is combined with price-based and substitution-based demand responses to form integrated demand response strategy. Secondly, with the goal of achieving the optimal operating cost of the integrated energy system, an optimal scheduling model for the power system and natural gas system was constructed. Finally, the distributed optimization solution of integrated energy system is achieved using the alternating direction multiplier method with adaptive penalty. By comparing and analyzing the examples under different cases, it is verified that the total cost of the system proposed in this paper considering the stepped incentive integrated demand response mechanism is reduced by 19.5 % compared with that the system without demand response. The gas load reduction volume of the system is increased by 53 m3. The simulation results demonstrate that the dynamic incentive mechanism is conducive to mobilizing the users to participate in the demand response and helps to improve the system economy.

AB Community energy consumption accounts for a large proportion of total social energy consumption. Therefore, community integrated energy systems have emerged to satisfy these demands. However, limited resource allocation of the integrated energy system in a single community is possible because of poor anti-interference and insufficient photovoltaic absorption. A distributionally robust optimal dispatching model was proposed for the joint operation of multiple community integrated energy systems, and the energy sharing and joint demand response among communities were considered. Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence was used to describe the ambiguity set of photovoltaic output probability distribution. When the photovoltaic output prediction error obeyed the extreme probability distribution of ambiguity set, the minimum operation cost of multi-community was solved. Furthermore, to ensure successful alliance of multi-community cooperative alliance, a profit allocation mechanism based on the improved Shapley value was proposed to reallocate the excess return fairly. Finally, a typical multi community integrated energy system was simulated and analysed. The results revealed that energy sharing and joint demand response improve the economy of multi community operation, and the coordination of system robustness and economy of the model was realised. The proposed profit allocation mechanism can effectively ensure multi community cooperation.

AB With the rapid development of society, global energy is in short supply. China has put forward an integrated energy system focusing on interconnecting energy resources and harnessing their complementary advantages to address the energy crisis, thus no longer pursuing the production, transportation and supply of a single source of energy. In the continuous development of integrated energy systems, the elements of participation and interaction are becoming more complex. Game theory, which can effectively solve the problems arising from multi-agent trading, is naturally introduced to the integrated energy system. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the introduction of game theory into the integrated energy system. First, the development of integrated energy is briefly introduced, game scenarios in integrated energy systems is proposed, and game scenarios considering the energy supply side, distribution network, demand side and common planning and dispatching problems in integrated energy systems are summarized. Secondly, main game theory models in the integrated energy system are summarized, such as cooperative game theory model, the non-cooperative game theory model and the Stackelberg game theory model. Finally, the future prospect and challenge for the application of game theory in integrated energy systems is proposed. The new game models are introduced to the integrated energy system, and a mixed game is considered to solve related problems. It is hoped that this work can serve as a reference for the researchers in this field.

AB Rational planning for remote integrated energy systems is of great importance for demand guarantee and sustainable development of remote areas. A critical challenge is that comprehensive factors, e.g., technical, economic, environmental, and social, which are inherently intertwined, should be properly evaluated and balanced in terms of social benefits. In addition, the feasibility of each planning scheme can only be verified based on their local electrical conditions by employing multi-energy flow calculations. Thus, this paper develops a comprehensive methodology for the optimal planning of remote integrated energy systems taking into account the uncertainty of renewable energy, where a multi-criteria decision-making procedure is designed, including the candidate set construction, remote integrated energy systems modeling, multi-energy flow calculation of the candidates, index definition and selection, and the optimal scheme determination. The methodology is applied to a case study in Lankao County, China. The optimal scheme, selected by the proposed multi-criteria decision-making procedure from 432 candidates, shows the best comprehensive performance, which is verified by different ranking methods. The optimal scheme can rank in the top 13% of each aspect on average, with economic and environmental aspects ranking in the top 2%. The methodology can help decision-makers find reasonable solutions for energy system planning in remote areas.

AB This study presents an individual-based model of heterogeneous integrated energy systems, which is composed of sub-energy system individuals and coupling individuals. Different evolution rules are depicted within one individual to form an accurate model of a complex system. Based on the model, a gradient descent direction iterative method (GDDM) is proposed for energy flow calculation of integrated energy systems to improve its convergence performance. Furthermore, a GDDM-based cumulants method (GDDM-CM) is presented to analyse the probabilistic energy flow distribution throughout the system. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, simulation studies have been undertaken in a modified complex integrated energy system. The results show that GDDM performs better than non-gradient descent method (NGDM). It converges faster and is insensitive to the initial point. Besides, GDDM-CM can obtain similar results as monte-carlo sampling method does and its calculation accuracy is better than that of the point estimate method. Moreover, the proposed GDDM-CM can greatly reduce the calculation time compared with the other two methods. Utilizing the GDDM-CM, the coupling effects of different individuals are investigated and the weak points in each individual can be identified.

AB Integrated energy systems (IES) are under development to accommodate the widespread penetration of renewable energy into power systems. The universal utilization of coupling components makes the connection between power grids and heat grids even closer. This paper applies energy flow calculations to planning problems and explores a method for selecting coupling components in the integrated electrical and heating systems. This process is based on the analysis of energy flow distribution and the comprehensive indexes, which include operation cost and the penalty cost of wind curtailment and solar energy curtailment. Besides, a selection method of coupling components installation locations based on energy flow calculations is provided. At last, an IES with 5 electrical buses and 5 heating nodes, and a 9bus electrical power system with a 31-node heating transmission system are chosen to study the specific application problems in detail as well as to elucidate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It turned out that the relevant coupling components and their positions can be selected according to the indexes obtained by integrated electrical-hydraulic-thermal calculation. This proposed method is conducive to the planning of integrated energy systems.

AB With the transformation of the energy market from the traditional vertical integrated structure to the interactive competitive structure, the traditional centralized optimization method makes it difficult to reveal the interactive behavior of multi-agent integrated energy systems (MAIES). In this paper, a master-slave game optimal scheduling strategy of MAIES is proposed based on the integrated demand response. Firstly, a master-slave game framework of MAIES is established with an energy management agent as leader, an energy operation agent, an energy storage agent, and a user aggregation agent as followers. Secondly, in view of the wind and solar uncertainty, the Monte Carlo method is used to generate random scenarios, and the k-means clustering method and pre-generation elimination technology are used for scenario reduction. Then, according to different flexible characteristics of loads, a multi-load and multi-type integrated demand response model including electric, thermal, and cold energy is built to fully utilize the regulation role of flexible resources. On this basis, the transaction decision-making models of each agent are constructed, and the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium solution are proved. Finally, the case simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal scheduling strategy of MAIES. Compared to the scenario without considering the wind and solar uncertainty and the integrated demand response, the rate of renewable energy curtailment was reduced by 6.03% and the carbon emissions of the system were reduced by 1335.22 kg in the scenario considering the proposed method in this paper.

SO JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY

ID DEMAND RESPONSE
AB Industrial integrated energy systems (IESs) and electric vehicles (EVs) provide new solutions for addressing the increasing challenges of the energy crisis and environmental pollution. With the increasing number of EVs and smart charging stations in industrial IES, the uncoordinated charging load of EVs imposes significant pressure on IES. Therefore, a well-designed dispatch scheme is crucial for reducing the economic cost for both parties, alleviating the energy supply pressure on IES, and promoting the development of a low-carbon society. To this end, given the load characteristics of EVs in industrial IES, we propose a dispatch framework based on the Stackelberg game theory, which includes the leader and the follower. The leader IES is responsible for formulating both unit dispatch and demand response plans, as well as determining the charging pricing for the smart charging station. The follower smart charging station optimizes EVs charging power by minimizing the charging cost in order to protect the interest of EV owners. Additionally, we introduce the carbon emission flow model into charging station pricing to shift the responsibility for carbon emissions from the generation side to the EV load side. Considering that the two-layer game model is difficult to solve, we use the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition and duality theorem to transform it into an equivalent single-layer optimization problem, which is easily solved. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed game framework effectively reduces the economic cost of IES and the charging cost of EVs, alleviates the pressure from charging load, and reduces the carbon emissions of industrial IES.

AB By coupling multiple energy networks, an integrated energy system can realize the conversion and complementarity of various energy sources. The development of regional integrated energy systems (RIESs) has brought both opportunities and challenges to the energy market. Without a reasonable integrated energy day-ahead trading structure, it is difficult for energy providers to make profits and for consumers to achieve economic energy utilization. At the same time, various user-side energy loads are controllable, and it is necessary to comprehensively consider multi-energy demand responses in energy trading and management. To address the above issues, the trading behaviors of main market players are clarified, and an integrated energy pricing and management strategy is proposed in this paper. Multi energy demand response models for data centers, electric vehicles (EVs) and air conditioning loads (ACLs) are also established. Considering multi-energy demand responses, a day-ahead energy pricing and management model for RIESs is proposed. The model is a bilevel Stackelberg game optimization model, in which the upper level considers profit maximization of energy service provider (ESP) while the lower level deals with the cost minimization of energy consumer (EC). Based on simulation analysis, the feasibility of the proposed model is verified. The trading scheme optimized by this model can benefit both ESP and EC. Compared with a traditional integrated energy trading structure, the profit source of ESP is enlarged. The simulation results also show that the application of multi-energy demand responses can improve the economic and collaborative operation effect of RIESs and reduce carbon emissions.

AB Regional Integrated Energy Systems (RIES) play a crucial role in promoting low-carbon transformation and sustainable development in the power industry. However, existing dispatch strategies for RIES overlook the varying value of energy storage devices across different time periods, making it difficult to adapt to future energy market development and reduce system operation costs. Therefore, this study constructs a bi-level RIES optimization dispatch model with an energy producer and an energy management center at the upper level, and IESs at the lower level. First, the energy entity dispatch is solved by an improved single-objective black kite algorithm based on a variable predation dynamics strategy (BKAS), while the bi-level dispatch that considers all energy entities is solved by a multi-objective black kite algorithm (MOBKA). Second, a generalized energy pool-driven virtual energy storage framework is proposed to manage energy storage devices without altering the system topology. Additionally, a multi-time-scale synergy carbon-storage game strategy is introduced to balance the economic and environmental benefits of the RIES. Finally, case studies verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed methods and theories. The results show that under the combined effect of the virtual energy storage framework and the carbon-storage game strategy, the economic cost of IESs increases by 1.96 %, carbon emissions decrease by 21.66 %, and the revenue of the energy management center increases by 31.77 %. These findings contribute to improving the operational efficiency of RIES and enhancing the new energy consumption level.

AB In order to further improve the ultra-short-term forecasting accuracy of multivariate loads for integrated energy systems (IES), this paper proposes a multivariate load forecasting method based on PatchTST coupled reconstruction with Progressive Layered Extraction (PLE) multi-task learning. Firstly, in order to fully exploit the coupling characteristics among multivariate loads, each load sequence is divided into several time series. Patch, the inter-temporal correlation among multivariate loads is captured by random masking, and the training set is reconstructed by considering seasonal characteristics. Then, the reconstructed multivariate load sequences are decomposed into several modal components by Triangulation Topology Aggregation Optimiser (TTAO) optimisation Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), and the period and trend items of each load sequence are obtained according to the Refined Composite Multiscale Entropy (RCMSE) of each component. For the smoother trend items, linear regression is used for prediction; for the non-stationary periodic items, the coupling relationship between loads and the independent characteristics of each load needs to be considered, and the PLE multi-task learning method is introduced to improve the prediction accuracy of each load task, which often occurs in the traditional multi-task learning IES multivariate load prediction. Finally, a comparison experiment is designed with the IES public dataset of Arizona State University in the U.S. The results show that the method proposed in this paper performs well, with a minimum accuracy improvement of 5.36 %, and the average prediction accuracy of the total load of the model reaches 97.72 %.

ID DEMAND; REGRESSION
AB With the rapid development and wide application of distributed generation technology and new energy trading methods, the integrated energy system has developed rapidly in Europe in recent years and has become the focus of new strategic competition and cooperation among countries. As a key technology and decision-making approach for operation, optimization, and control of integrated energy systems, power consumption prediction faces new challenges. The user-side power demand and load characteristics change due to the influence of distributed energy. At the same time, in the open retail market of electricity sales, the forecast of electricity consumption faces the power demand of small-scale users, which is more easily disturbed by random factors than by a traditional load forecast. Therefore, this study proposes a model based on X12 and Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) decomposition of monthly electricity consumption forecasting methods. The first use of the STL model according to the properties of electricity each month is its power consumption time series decomposition individuation. It influences the factorization of monthly electricity consumption into season, trend, and random components. Then, the change in the characteristics of the three components over time is considered. Finally, the appropriate model is selected to predict the components in the reconfiguration of the monthly electricity consumption forecast. A forecasting program is developed based on R language and MATLAB, and a case study is conducted on the power consumption data of a university campus containing distributed energy. Results show that the proposed method is reasonable and effective.

AB Accurate multi-energy load forecasting plays an important role in the stable and secure operation of integrated energy systems (IESs). The strong randomness and complex coupling relationship among multiple energy loads bring huge challenges for the accurate forecasting of multi-energy load. In this context, this paper proposes a multi-task learning method-enabled probabilistic load forecasting method for the joint prediction of electric, cooling, and heating loads. Specifically, a complex neural network (ComNN) is developed to capture the coupling relationships between the multiple loads by taking aggregated multi-source information as input. The hard-parameter sharing mechanism is adopted to share information between tasks and reduce the risk of overfitting in multi-task learning. To balance the training of multiple loads, a geometric loss function (GLF) is designed for the optimization of the ComNN. It is further extended to a geometric quantile loss function to capture the uncertainties of multi-energy load. The ComNN allows the coupling information to be shared among the multiple tasks, which enhances the forecasting performance of the proposed method on each individual task. The designed geometric quantile loss function further enables the proposed method to dynamically balance the weights for different tasks during training and achieve effective quantification of the multi-energy load forecasting outcomes. Comparative tests with state-of-the-art forecasting methods using regional IES load data from Arizona State University's Tempe campus and Western China demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in both deterministic and probabilistic multi-energy load forecasting.

AB Against the background of carbon peak and carbon neutralization, in order to solve the problem of poor flexibility of integrated energy systems and wind power consumption while improving the potential of hydrogen energy emission reduction, this study proposes an integrated energy system that takes into account the coupling of concentrating solar power (CSP), hydrogen-doped combustion, and power-to-gas (P2G) conversion. Firstly, a mathematical model of a CSP-CHP unit is established by introducing a CSP power station, aiming at the defect of the "heat to power" mode in the CHP system. Secondly, the energy consumption of P2G hydrogen energy production is satisfied by surplus wind power. The utilization stage of hydrogen energy is divided into supply CHP combustion and CO2 methanation, forming a CSP-P2G-HCHP collaborative framework and establishing an IES low-carbon economic dispatch model with CSP-P2G-HCHP. At the same time, the carbon trading mechanism is introduced to constrain the carbon emissions of the system. Finally, an optimization strategy with the minimum sum of the operation and maintenance cost, the energy purchase cost, the wind curtailment cost, and the carbon emission cost as the objective function is proposed, and the CPLEX solver is used to solve and carry out multi-case analysis. The simulation results show that the carbon emissions are reduced by 6.34%, the wind curtailment cost is reduced by 52.2%, and the total cost is reduced by 1.67%. The model takes into account the carbon reduction effect and operating efficiency and effectively improves the new energy consumption capacity.

AB To address the issues of low coordination in low-carbon operation between Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) devices and Power to Gas (P2G) devices in integrated energy systems (IES), as well as the inaccurate characterization of carbon emissions from energy storage devices, this paper proposes an extended carbon emission flow model that integrates the collaborative operation mode of CCS-P2G and the low-carbon characteristics of energy storage. The model establishes a coupling relationship between CCS and P2G on the energy supply side to achieve low-carbon economic operation of P2G. On the energy storage side, the concept of "electricity-carbon ratio (ECR)" is introduced to characterize the carbon emission characteristics of energy storage devices, exploring the potential for coordinated low-carbon dispatch on both the energy supply and energy storage sides. Based on this, a low-carbon economic dispatch model for integrated energy systems is constructed, considering multiple uncertainties such as wind power, electricity prices, and electric-heat-gas loads. To achieve fast and efficient solving of the model, a parallel multi-dimensional approximate dynamic programming algorithm is adopted, which significantly improves solving efficiency by constructing a multi-layer parallel loop nested framework without losing solving accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm is validated using an improved E14-H6-G6 system, consisting of a 14-node power grid, a 6-node heating network, and a 6-node gas network. The CCS-P2G (Carbon Capture, Storage, and Power-to-Gas) collaborative operation mode discussed in this article significantly enhances the economic and low-carbon performance of the Integrated Energy System (IES) by fully reutilizing CO2. Compared to unmodified coal-fired power units, the total cost is reduced by 137,900 yuan, thereby validating the effectiveness of the CCS-P2G collaborative operation mode in low-carbon scheduling.

AB In this paper, a resilience-oriented dynamic planning framework is developed for optimal sizing of the community-integrated energy system components, including photovoltaic system, wind turbine, boiler, power to gas technology, combined heat and power, and storage devices. The proposed framework is formulated as a trilevel linear programming that performs Community-Integrated Energy Systems design under normal conditions at the first level while evaluating system operation during disastrous conditions at the second level. In the third level, re-planning is done based on information-gap decision theory to enhance community-integrated energy systems' resilience against various natural disasters. Stochastic programming is also employed at all levels to address the uncertainty of electricity market price, energy demand, solar radiation, and wind speed. A detailed P2G system including, a methanation device, electrolysis, and hydrogen storage is designed to improve the resilience of the system. In addition, the power to gas proposed in this model is coupled with a carbon capture unit to mitigate carbon emission by reusing emitted carbon from the flue gas of the boiler and combined heat and power. Various economic metrics and technical constraints are also considered to achieve a realistic design. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the positive interplay of renewable energy resources and energy storage technologies, specifically P2G, assisted the CIES in maintaining a stable and uninterrupted energy supply during extreme events. The results exhibit that increasing only 10% of the resilience budget can decrease >93% of unserved demand and helps reduction of >37 % of carbon emissions.

AB The growing demand for clean energy and sustainable industrial processes has driven interest in integrated energy systems that optimize resource utilization while minimizing environmental impacts. This study presents the simulation and environmental sustainability assessment of an integrated process combining liquefied natural gas (LNG), Allam-Fetvedt cycle, solid oxide electrolysis' system, and methanol synthesis to produce clean energy. The proposed system enhances overall efficiency and sustainability by utilizing the Allam-Fetvedt cycle to generate power while capturing CO2, which is then used in the manufacture of syngas and hydrogen by the electrolysis of water and CO2. Syngas is subsequently transformed into methanol, a viable alternative fuel characterized by lowcarbon emissions. A comprehensive process simulation is conducted to evaluate energy efficiency, material flows, and system performance. The sustainability assessment focuses on environmental impact indicators, including carbon footprint reduction, energy efficiency improvements, and resource optimization. The results demonstrate that the integrated system significantly reduces CO2 emissions while maximizing energy recovery, making it a promising approach for decarbonized energy production. In this study, the integrated process including the ASU, power cycle, electrolyzers, methanol production units, and LNG unit results in carbon emissions of 0.29 kg CO2 per kg of LNG produced, which is very close to the literature-reported lower limit, even though it also has methanol production. On the other hand, when the identical process is assessed solely for methanol production (without the LNG unit), it attains net-zero carbon emissions. Despite the incorporation of high-energy electrolyzer systems, the overall energy demand of the proposed integrated process remains comparable to that of existing conventional technologies with high emission outputs.

AB Integrated energy systems (IESs) seek to minimize power generating costs in future power grids through the coupling of different energy technologies. To accommodate fluctuations in load demand due to the penetration of renewable energy sources, flexible operation capabilities must be fully exploited, and even power plants that are traditionally considered as base-load units need to be operated according to unconventional paradigms. Thermomechanical loads induced by frequent power adjustments can accelerate the wear and tear. If a unit is flexibly operated without respecting limits on materials, the risk of failures of expensive components will eventually increase, nullifying the additional profits ensured by flexible operation. In addition to the bounds on power variations (explicit constraints),the solution of the unit dispatch problem needs to meet the limits on the variation of key process variables, including temperature, pressure and flow rate (implicit constraints).The FARM (Feasible Actuator Range Modifier) module was developed to enable existing optimization algorithms to identify solutions to the unit dispatch problem that are both economically favorable and technologically sustainable. Thanks to the iterative dispatcher-validator scheme, FARM permits addressing all the imposed constraints without excessively increasing the computational costs. In this work, the algorithms constituting the module are described, and the performance was assessed by solving the unit dispatch problem for an IES composed of three units, i.e., balance of plant, gas turbine, and high-temperature steam electrolysis. Finally, the FARM module provides dedicated tools for visualizing the response of the constrained variables of interest during operational transients and a tool aiding the operator at making decisions. These techniques might represent the first step towards the deployment of an ecological interface design (EID) for IES units.

AB An operating entity utilizing community-integrated energy systems with a large number of small-scale distributed energy sources can easily trade with existing distribution markets. To solve the energy management and pricing problem of multi-community integrated energy systems (MCIESs) with multi-energy interaction, this study investigated a hierarchical stochastic optimal scheduling method for uncertain environments. To handle multiple uncertainties, a Wasserstein generative adversarial network with a gradient penalty was used to generate renewable scenarios, and the Kmeans++ clustering algorithm was employed to generate typical scenarios. A Stackelberg-based hierarchical stochastic schedule with an integrated demand response was constructed, where the MCIES operator acted as the leader pursuing the maximum net profit by setting energy prices, while the building users were followers who adjusted their energy consumption plans to minimize their total costs. Finally, a distributed iterative solution method based on a metaheuristic was designed. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified using practical examples.

AB Electricity-gas-heat integrated energy systems (IES) provides an effective way to accommodate renewable energy due to its sufficient flexible generation resources and flexible operating modes. This paper focuses on the distributionally robust operation problem of multi-area IES in a distributed manner. A distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) economic dispatch (ED) model is developed to handle renewable energy uncertainties in IES. Different flexible generation resources in each energy sector are exploited for uncertainty mitigation in the proposed DRCC ED model. Meanwhile, to achieve the decision-making independence of each local IES, an accelerated alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is adopted to solve the resulting multi-area ED model in a fully decentralized and parallel manner. Case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Carbon trading mechanisms and the development of integrated energy systems are important ways to realize the "carbon peaking and carbon neutrality" goal, and the problem of benefit distribution is of paramount importance to achieving the goal. The article innovatively takes the supply side of the provincial integrated energy system as the entry point, considers the economic value of carbon, and focuses on the rational allocation of each subject obtained by comparing different methods. The paper mainly uses the Shapley value of the cooperative game and the kernel method to establish the initial allocation to the main actors, and subsequently, it considers the introduction of the risk level, resource input, environmental pollution, technological innovation, and profit of the main actors to modify the result of the benefit allocation. This paper takes the power generation data of the Xinjiang region as an example, and the results show that 1) thermal power still has the most weight among all power generation modes and obtains 522.83, 503.48, and 406.30 billion yuan under the initial, nucleolus, and modified allocation methods, respectively, and receives the most revenue. 2) Considering that the multi-factor allocation method pays more attention to the allocation of fairness, compared with the initial allocation, thermal power gains decreased by 22.29%, while wind and solar power gains were improved by 17.87% and 60.90%, respectively. The result could be a stronger push for the development and transformation of power energy. 3) The feasibility of this game as a convex game should be verified, the improvement method should be demonstrated through examples, and the results should be compared with reality. Finally, policy recommendations are proposed, which will be useful for realizing the "carbon peaking and carbon neutrality" goal and the synergistic development of integrated energy systems.

TI Probabilistic net load forecasting framework for application in

   forecasting; Quantile personalized standard load profile
ID PHOTOVOLTAIC POWER-GENERATION
AB Integrating various sectors enhances resilience in distributed sector-integrated energy systems. Forecasting is vital for unlocking full potential and enabling well-informed decisions in energy management. Given the inherent variability in generation and demand prediction, quantification of uncertainty is crucial. Therefore, probabilistic forecasting is becoming imperative compared to deterministic forecasting, as it ensures a more comprehensive depiction of uncertainty. This paper introduces probabilistic net load forecasting framework (PNLFF), a non-blackbox approach that is robust, non-parametric, computational and data inexpensive, and adaptable across sectors. It utilizes the personalized standard load profile for deterministic forecasts, and integrates quantile regression to generate probabilistic forecast. The cumulative distribution function is approximated from quantiles of probabilistic forecast using piecewise cubic hermite interpolating polynomial, and then it is derived to probability density function (PDF). Then the probabilistic net load was obtained by the convolution of PDFs for electricity demand, heat demand and PV generation. A case study demonstrates its application in operational optimization for a distributed energy system of the logistics facility. In the first stage of the PNLFF, the results of the personalized standard load profiles clearly show that they can be applied in all sectors and outperform their respective benchmarks. The second stage, the probabilistic expansion using quantile regression, also performs promisingly across all sectors, with the best results being achieved in particular with a small training data set of 30 days. With the extension of the quantiles and interpolation, it was demonstrated how a PDF can be approximated without prior knowledge of the distribution of the data. The result of the case study demonstrate that the PNL, as an aggregated PDF of the different sectors by convolution, can be used for decision making under uncertainty, e.g. for the planning of flexible loads.

AB The increasing penetration of alternative energy sources into the integrated energy systems often influences the voltage stability (VS) of the entire system. However, developing a technique that comprehensively analyze the energy flow in this environment is a major challenge. This paper presents a novel heuristic-based recurrent type Hopfield Neural Network (h-HNN) planning tool for VS assessment of power system; towards reducing the computational cost of conventional power flow (PF) method. The proposed approach is a Jacobian-less, energy function-based approach, which was formulated using power residuals of the system. The dynamics of neural networks were governed by the differential equations of energy function, which would be minimized by the heuristic particle swarm optimization-gravitational search algorithm to deduce the unknown parameters of voltage magnitude and phase angle. The proposed technique was coded in MATLAB and its effectiveness was tested on IEEE 14-, 30-, and 57-buses, as well as a 1354-bus test system. The obtained results were compared with well-known PF techniques, and the robustness was demonstrated for ill-conditioned network. A composite severity index was proposed to rank the critical contingency of the energy network. Then, the VS assessment was performed in IEEE 14-bus system under severe contingency conditions and improvement of VS is observed under the penetration of distributed energy sources (DES). During the case of DES placement, (i) the voltage profile of the system is maintained within the acceptable range of 0.95 to 1.05 pu and (ii) the VS of the system evaluated using stability indices are enhanced by an amount of 16.54 % to 88.16 %. The application results indicate that the proposed method is useful for electric energy utilities to assess the state of the system under monitoring process.

AB Integrated energy systems (IESs) have been implemented with the objective of enhancing the efficiency of energy utilization and facilitating the sustainable transition of society and energy systems. To further explore the multi-energy coupling capacity and carbon reduction potential of the IESs, this study presents the design of an integrated cold-electricity-heat energy system (ICEHS) with advanced adiabatic compressed air energy storage (AA-CAES). AA-CAES has the capacity to not only store and release electric energy, but also to provide cold and heat energy, which makes it an ideal choice for this application. The main work of this study is fourfold: (1) the energy hub concept is employed to describe the energy transformations within AA-CAES, thereby reducing the modeling complexity; (2) integrated demand response (IDR) for cooling, heating, and electric loads, including shiftable loads, adjustable loads, interruptible loads, and replaceable loads, is considered; (3) Latin hypercubic sampling in conjunction with K-means clustering is employed to address the issue of source-load uncertainty; and (4) an ICEHS operation optimization model is developed with the objective of minimizing the daily operating cost, where the possible cost terms include energy purchase cost, operation and maintenance cost, demand response cost, and carbon emission cost. A typical community integrated energy system is employed as an illustrative example, and four different scenarios are established to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results indicate that AA-CAES and IDR can effectively reduce the daily operating cost and carbon emissions of an ICEHS. In comparison to the scenario that did not incorporate AA-CAES and IDR, the daily operating cost and carbon emissions are reduced by 4.8% and 10.3%, respectively.

AB The rapid development of the technology of energy conversion is changing the global energy landscape. In this study, a reliability analysis framework for Integrated Energy Systems (IESs) is developed, based on the concept of Integrated Deterministic and Probabilistic Safety Analysis (IDPSA). A bi-directional energy conversion system model is developed to simulate the deterministic evolution of the IES. Then, the dynamic event tree (DET) analysis technique is used to describe the stochastic evolution of IES, based on the physics of IES. Given the scenarios from the DET, the probabilistic safety margin method is used to evaluate the reliability of IES. The contract pressures at delivery points are adopted as critical safety parameters for the evaluation of the safety margins. To reduce the computational burden, Order Statistics, combining the Bracketing and Coverage approaches, are used to obtain the percentiles of the probabilistic distribution of the safety parameters. An application of the developed framework is performed on an IES. The results indicate that the framework can evaluate the reliability of IES from the perspectives of dynamic failure probability and operation performance. Furthermore, the impact of P2G (power to gas) on the energy supply and operation security of the IES is analysed in detail. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Integrated energy systems (IES) are an important physical carrier of the energy Internet, which undertakes the tasks of energy conversion, distribution, and storage of electricity, heat and cold. From the perspective of energy Internet, this paper studies the optimal operation scheduling of an urban power grid with a high proportion of clean energy and proposes a multi-energy coordinated intelligent management method for the urban power grid. Firstly, the structure and typical characteristics of urban energy Internet are researched. On this basis, the regulatory capacity of the adjustable generator set and the regenerative equipment is used to offset the volatility of renewable energy, the internal operating system, and network stable operation constraints are considered. To solve the model, alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is used. Finally, a real-time power grid example is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB One of the major leaps in power systems is the increased use of renewable sources in the production of electricity. These integrated energy systems are increasingly replacing the conventional power plants in various sections around the globe. In this paper, an optimal utilization of the integrated solar, wind and conventional power energy systems has been proposed in the presence of an Interline power flow controller (IPFC). A suitable location has been chosen for the placement of the renewable sources and IPFC based on suitable indexes. The IPFC has been further tuned for reduction of power loss in electrical network and reduction of voltage deviation. The proposed methodology is executed on a modified IEEE 30 bus system.

AB Hydrocarbons in the form of natural gas can be used in long-term energy production and could strengthen the defossilisation of the energy sector. However, operational reliability will decrease due to gas shortages in integrated energy systems. Correlations exist among the multiple failure patterns such as overloads of the transmission lines, overloads of the combined heat and power generator, and over-limit operations of gas compressors. The energy reliability assessment problem becomes more difficult to resolve for integrated energy systems than for power systems. This paper proposes an analytical method to address the multiple correlated risks that are caused by the energy network interactions in an integrated energy system. Three case results in MATLAB demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed method. Compared to the Monte Carlo algorithm, which required approximately 550 s to obtain a precise failure probability with 50 thousand samples, the proposed method takes approximately 12.7 s to obtain an exact failure probability. The advantage is that, different from wide-bound theory and narrow-bound theory, the proposed method can offer a certain value rather than two bounds with respect to the failure probability.

AB Integrated energy systems are considered a practical solution to fulfill low-carbon energy systems. Accordingly, the concept of a virtual energy hub (VEH) and its capability to participate in different energy markets have attracted significant attention recently. In this regard, the self-scheduling problem of VEH, including a wide variety of uncertainties capable of participating in multiple energy markets, is addressed in this paper. To this end, a two-stage stochastic optimization has been implemented to solve the scheduling problem of a VEH equipped with renewable energy resources as well as conventional units as internal suppliers, different types of energy storage systems, hydrogen vehicles (HVs), and electric vehicles (EVs) in the intelligent parking lot (IPL). The studied VEH can participate in gas and hydrogen markets as well as day-ahead (DA) and real-time (RT) power and heat markets. The impact of flexible units, including energy storage systems and demand response programs, on the expected profit of the VEH is investigated accurately. Based on the obtained results employing a battery energy storage system (BESS), thermal energy storage system (TESS), hydrogen energy storage system (HESS), and cooling energy storage system (CESS) increases the profit of VEH by 0.88%, 0.62%, 1.5%, and 0.64%, respectively. Also, the profit of VEH can be increased by 1.02% and 0.25% by applying the electrical demand response program (EDRP) and thermal demand response program (TDRP), respectively. As risk management is critical for the participation of VEH in multiple energy markets, second-order-stochastic-dominance (SOSD) constraints are imposed on the scheduling problem instead of employing typical risk measures such as conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Although the proposed risk-management method can shape optimal profit distribution based on the operators' attitude toward risk, benchmark selection is the main obstacle to the mentioned approach. To this end, the CVaR-based benchmark selection method is applied to overcome the stated obstacle and guarantee the problem's feasibility.

AB Under the retail electricity market reform and the development of demand-side integrated energy systems in China, the Integrated Energy Service Agency (IESA) is responsible for purchasing energy from the external market and supplying it to multi-energy users (MEUs). However, with the increase in the types of MEUs, the IESA has gained more sales options. How to meet the required MEU participation level in the integrated demand response (IDR) plan to ensure that the IESA sets the optimal integrated energy price is an urgent problem. In this paper, a bi-level optimal low-carbon economic dispatch model for an industrial park is proposed considering multi-energy price incentives; at the upper level, the model takes the optimal net income of the IESA as the target, and the carbon emission constraints of the real-time unit integrated energy supply are considered, so that the IESA can reasonably dispatch a comprehensive energy supply, optimize the operation of energy conversion equipment, and set reasonable energy selling prices based on energy prices in the external market. At the lower level, the model takes the minimum integrated energy cost to MEUs as the goal. MEUs take the initiative to obtain retail energy price signals, formulate optimal multi-energy use strategies, and actively participate in the IDR plan. At the same time, coordination between the upper and lower levels helps to optimize the price of the energy sold and the power used by the IDR and is therefore used to achieve the overall environmental and economic requirements of the industrial park. The prime dual path following the interior point method is used to solve the nonlinear, multidimensional, and double-iterative optimization model, and three typical examples are used to illustrate that the model and method can improve the net income of the IESA, ensure the economic and environmental protection of the cooperative multi-energy operation, and encourage MEUs to actively participate in the IDR plan.

AB The growing recognition of the value of hydrogen as an energy intermediate in supporting future power systems with high shares of variable renewable energy has prompted many studies to quantify the economic potential of multi-output hybrid systems, which are one type of integrated energy systems (IES). Because of the complexity of modeling multiple sectors, these studies typically use simplified modeling approaches to capture the interactions between sectors. In this study, we explore the implications of alternative modeling approaches for nuclearhydrogen IES focusing on a power system in the Midwest United States. We combine highly resolved capacity expansion and production cost modeling tools of the power system with a detailed hydrogen system optimization tool to determine the optimal electrolyzer and storage sizing and optimal operations of the nuclear-hydrogen hybrid resource across three future study years. We compare economic and operational outcomes across a spectrum of modeling approaches, including a non-hybridized base approach; a traditional price-taker approach that does not include the impact of hydrogen production on the electricity system; a power-system-focused pricemaker approach that does not account for temporal hydrogen constraints; and two improved price-taker and price-maker approaches that each address the impact of revenue-optimal levels of electricity production on the resulting power system and temporal hydrogen constraints on the overall feasible solution. Results show how a traditional price-taker approach can overestimate the economic benefits of multi-output nuclear-hydrogen IES compared to our two improved approaches that estimate both hydrogen system constraints and power system interaction. We find that hydrogen output requirements and storage size limits are key drivers to overall operations and some economic outcomes. Under our assumed constant hydrogen output requirement, storage costs, test system, and modeling approaches, our results indicate that hybridization can provide a net benefit, but results are sensitive to the treatment of hydrogen revenues and electricity prices as impacted by the power system evolution.

AB The challenges of energy shortage and environmental protection motivate people to take various measures to use energy wisely, and integrated energy systems are such a measure to tackle this challenge. In this paper, an optimal expansion planning model for an integrated energy system consisting of power grid, gas network and multiple energy hubs is proposed, where the planning objective is to minimize operational fuel cost and capital investment cost covering carbon capture equipment and energy hubs among others. To demonstrate the advantage of the proposed planning model, six case studies are investigated, and 13.47% annual cost savings can be achieved compared with the baseline planning scenario, which does not consider bidirectional energy exchange and integrated demand response program.

AB This paper proposes a distributed energy management strategy, based on dual decomposition mixed integer linear programming for port integrated energy systems (PIESs), to improve the utilization of renewable energy, and to foster green ports. Firstly, due to the distributed characteristics presented by various heterogeneous devices, a polymorphic network-based PIES was established, instead of the traditional single IP protocol, incorporating electricity replacement and energy conversion devices. Secondly, taking into account the coupling of various energy flows, an energy management model was constructed, to ensure reliable operation for the PIES. Thirdly, an energy management strategy based on distributed dual decomposition mixed integer linear programming for the PIES was proposed, which took into account the distributed characteristic of the PIES. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy was demonstrated, by simulation cases in different scenarios for the PIES. The obtained energy management results were similar to the centralized algorithm.

AB Energy flow plays an important role in optimal operation and planning analysis of integrated energy systems. However, in the energy flow calculation of integrated energy systems, the model of natural gas networks is inaccuracy. In traditional models, the gas compressor is modeled with a single compression ratio, without regard for the impact of different operating modes on energy flow. However, compressors often operate in different modes, so the constant compression ratio model will lead to inaccurate results of energy flow. To enhance the accuracy of energy flow, multiple compressor operating modes are considered in this paper, including constant compression ratio mode, constant outlet pressure mode, and constant natural gas flow mode. Also, for conciseness, the three modes are unified formulated by a general equation. Then, to ascertain the energy flow, a complete gradient descent iterative method is proposed, in which the partial derivatives of each state variable are calculated, and a new Jacobian matrix is derived. Compared with the non-gradient descent method, the computational speed of the proposed method is faster while the computational accuracy has not been reduced. The results tested on 14 node electricity-14 node heat-10 node gas and 1047 node electricity-32 node heat-48 node gas integrated systems show that the operating modes of compressors have great influences on the gas pressure distribution, which further affect the distributions of electricity and heat. Also, the superiority of the proposed gradient descent method is verified.

AB With increasing renewable energy integrated to the integrated energy systems (IESs), the dynamic characteristics and coupling effects of different forms of energy need to be taken into consideration. Dynamic behaviors of heating systems are not well captured by the traditional steady-state models of integrated heat-electricity systems (IHESs). As integrated demand response (IDR) technology is widely used in IHESs, it is of great significance to establish the models of IHESs considering demand side management and dynamic behaviors of district heating network (DHN). Firstly, in order to accurately reflect the real-time operation of the systems, a modeling method of IHESs containing source, network, and load is proposed. Then, based on the dynamic model of each equipment in the DHN and the demand response of multiple types of loads, a multi-energy flow dynamic model considering IDR and dynamic behaviors of DHN is proposed. In this paper, the models of the equipment are integrated under a unified framework, and a coordinated control model of the IHES is given, which aims to realize the economic operation of the system. Finally, the system model is placed in different scenarios for simulation. The results verify the dynamic characteristics of the DHN, and prove that the control strategy design for the IHES can help to improve the wind power consumption capacity and reduce costs.

AB The application of Integrated Energy Systems (IES) in establishing low-carbon, safe, and efficient energy supply systems has gained significant attention in recent years. However, as an energy stability link in IES, there is a lack of mature theoretical methods for energy allocation and optimal planning in the current multi-energy storage system (MESS) research. Hence, this paper proposes a method for configuring the capacity and selecting storage types in MESS within the IES. By considering the power response characteristics of different storage media, a combined ESMD-MPSO model is established that aims to enhance the economy and extend the service life of MESS. The model could allocate the power to the energy storage devices based on their power response capabilities and economic evaluation. Additionally, MESS application scenarios in both islanded and grid-connected IES are established. Highly adaptable energy storage devices are selected using the Analytic Hierarchy Process and the Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation method, resulting in four different multi-energy storage schemes for analysis. The results demonstrate that the method enables the determination of cost-optimal energy storage combination and capacity configuration for both scenarios. Furthermore, compared to existing methods, the approach achieves a 22.1 % and 9.6 % improvement in annual average costs for the two scenarios. This research could provide guidance for the planning and development of multi-energy storage systems within the IES.

AB With the significant attention on global climate change, regional integrated energy systems (RIES) in low-carbon city planning has become one of the most important ways for global cities to achieve the goal of energy conservation and emission reduction. However, the planning strategy used in the primary stage of RIES establishment will greatly affect the system economy and environment. In view of the lack of planning guidance mechanisms for the large-scale RIES in China, a method for RIES preliminary overall planning, focused on energy types and use, is proposed in this paper. A graph theory-based mathematical optimal model was established with the lifetime costs of the whole system as the economic goal, and an improved Prim algorithm was put forward to solve the costs of the transmission and distribution network with the dynamic weight set of pipeline flow. The model was solved by an algorithm based on the idea of a dynamic minimum spanning tree and optimal path planning. The model and method were applied in a China-U.S. low-carbon demonstration city to verify feasibility and validity. The results could help us to comprehensively integrate regional energy and accurately plan future cities.

AB The low-carbon construction of integrated energy systems is a crucial path to achieving dual carbon goals, with the power-generation side having the greatest potential for emissions reduction and the most direct means of reduction, which is a current research focus. However, existing studies lack the precise modeling of carbon capture devices and the cascaded utilization of hydrogen energy. Therefore, this paper establishes a carbon capture power plant model based on a comprehensive, flexible operational mode and a coupled model of a two-stage P2G (Power-to-Gas) device, exploring the "energy time-shift" characteristics of the coupled system. IGDT (Information Gap Decision Theory) is used to discuss the impact of uncertainties on the power generation side system. The results show that by promoting the consumption of clean energy and utilizing the high energy efficiency of hydrogen while reducing reliance on fossil fuels, the proposed system not only meets current energy demands but also achieves a more efficient emission reduction, laying a solid foundation for a sustainable future. By considering the impact of uncertainties, the system ensures resilience and adaptability under fluctuating renewable energy supply conditions, making a significant contribution to the field of sustainable energy transition.

AB Optimally scheduling multi-energy flow is an effective method to utilize renewable energy sources (RES) and improve the stability and economy of integrated energy systems (IES). However, the stable demand-supply of IES faces challenges from uncertainties that arise from RES and loads, as well as the increasing impact of cyberattacks with advanced information and communication technologies adoption. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative model-free resilience scheduling method based on state-adversarial deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for integrated demand response (IDR)-enabled IES. The proposed method designs an IDR program to explore the interaction ability of electricity-gas-heat flexible loads. Additionally, the state-adversarial Markov decision process (SA-MDP) model characterizes the energy scheduling problem of IES under cyber-attack, incorporating cyber-attacks as adversaries directly into the scheduling process. The state-adversarial soft actor-critic (SA-SAC) algorithm is proposed to mitigate the impact of cyber-attacks on the scheduling strategy, integrating adversarial training into the learning process to against cyber-attacks. Simulation results demonstrate that our method is capable of adequately addressing the uncertainties resulting from RES and loads, mitigating the impact of cyber-attacks on the scheduling strategy, and ensuring astable demand supply for various energy sources. Moreover, the proposed method demonstrates resilience against cyber-attacks. Compared to the original soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, it achieves a 10% improvement in economic performance under cyber-attack scenarios.

AB The energy flow calculation of the integrated electric power and natural gas system (IEGS) is generally tackled by the classical Newton-Raphson (NR) method with second-order convergence. However, this method may fail to converge or incur oscillating iterations leading to heavy computation burden if the initial point is not selected properly, especially in heterogenous integrated energy systems containing the natural gas system. To handle this problem, a variant of Newton-Raphson method with third-order convergence is proposed, which needs one function and two derivative evaluations per iteration without increasing the number of derivative evaluations. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, simulation studies are carried out on several different cases for the energy flow calculation of IEGS. Experiment results reveal that the proposed method is superior to the classical Newton-Raphson method and its other variants in terms of computational efficiency.

ID MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION
AB The dispatch of integrated energy systems in coal mines (IES-CM) with mine-associated supplies is vital for efficient energy utilization and carbon emissions reduction. However, IES-CM dispatch is highly challenging due to its feature as multi-objective and strong multi-constraint. Existing constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms often fall into locally feasible domains with poorly distributed Pareto front, which greatly deteriorates dispatch performance. To tackle this problem, we transform the traditional dispatch model of IES-CM into two tasks: the main task with all constraints and the helper task with constraint adaptive. Then we propose a constraint adaptive multi-tasking differential evolution algorithm (CA-MTDE) to optimize these two tasks effectively. The helper task with constraint adaptive is developed to obtain infeasible solutions near the feasible domain. The purpose of this infeasible solution is to transfer guiding knowledge to help the main task move away from local search. Additionally, a dynamic dual-learning strategy using DE/current-to-rand/1 and DE/current-to-best/1 is developed to maintain task diversity and convergence. Finally, we comprehensively evaluate the performance of CA-MTDE by applying it to a coal mine in Shanxi Province, considering two IES-CM scenarios. Results demonstrate the feasibility of CA-MTDE and its ability to generate a Pareto front with exceptional convergence, diversity, and distribution.

AB The district heating network (DHN) is essential in enhancing the operational flexibility of integrated energy systems (IES). Yet, it is hard to obtain an accurate and concise DHN model for the operation owing to complicated network features and imperfect measurements. Considering this, this paper proposes a physically informed data-driven aggregate model (AGM) for the DHN, providing a concise description of the source-load relationship of DHN without exposing network details. First, we derive the analytical relationship between the state variables of the source and load nodes of the DHN, offering a physical fundament for the AGM. Second, we propose a physics-informed estimator for the AGM that is robust to low-quality measurements, in which the physical constraints associated with the parameter normalization and sparsity are embedded to improve the accuracy and robustness. Finally, we propose a physics-enhanced algorithm to solve the nonlinear estimator with non-closed constraints efficiently. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Nuclear Integrated Energy Systems (NIES) have emerged as a comprehensive solution for navigating the changing energy landscape. They combine nuclear power plants with renewable energy sources, storage systems, and smart grid technologies to optimize energy production, distribution, and consumption across sectors, improving efficiency, reliability, and sustainability while addressing challenges associated with variability. The integration of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) in NIES offers significant benefits over traditional nuclear facilities, although transferring involves overcoming legal and operational barriers, particularly in economic dispatch. This study proposes a novel off-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach with an ensemble reward system to optimize economic dispatch for nuclear-powered generation companies equipped with an SMR, demonstrating superior accuracy and efficiency when compared to conventional methods and emphasizing RL's potential to improve NIES profitability and sustainability. Finally, the research attempts to demonstrate the viability of implementing the proposed integrated RL approach in spot energy markets to maximize profits for nuclear-driven generation companies, establishing NIES' profitability over competitors that rely on fossil fuel-based generation units to meet baseload requirements.

AB Recently, the development of gas-fired units (GFU) and power-to-gas (PtG) technologies facilitates the interconnections of electricity and natural gas systems. However, the advanced information communication devices bring cyber security concerns of electricity-gas integrated energy systems. This paper proposes a tri-level defense strategy for electricity-gas integrated systems against load redistribution (LR) attacks. A bi-level LR attack model is proposed to overload multiple power lines and gas pipelines simultaneously. Then, a defense strategy is presented to guarantee the security constraints. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions and the big-M method are utilized to handle the tri-level model. Numerical results on a modified IEEE 118-bus power system with 14-node gas system verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy on mitigating the false data injection risks.

AB Extreme natural hazards, such as hurricanes or earthquakes, have a high probability of threatening energy supply security and causing high-order contingencies to island city-integrated energy systems (IC-IESs). To better evaluate and enhance resilience, a novel approach is proposed in this work for IC-IESs. The resilience of an IC-IES is analyzed from both the system level and the component level. At the system level, the impacts of extreme natural disasters are quantified. At the component level, the importance of individual components is analyzed through pre-failure and post-failure indices. The pre-failure index identifies the system's weak links before an energy interruption, and the post-failure index determines the optimal repair strategy to restore the service. The proposed indices are solved by the impact increment method (IIM), which significantly improves computational efficiency without much affecting result accuracy. Numerical simulation studies are conducted on the modified Barry Island IES and IES E123-G48-H32 test systems. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB The operation of integrated energy systems (IESs) is confronted with great challenges for increasing penetration rate of renewable energy and growing complexity of energy forms. Scenario generation is one of ordinary methods to alleviate the system uncertainties by extracting several typical scenarios to represent the original high-dimensional data. This paper proposes a novel representative scenario generation method based on the feature extraction of panel data. The original high-dimensional data are represented by an aggregated indicator matrix using principal component analysis to preserve temporal variation. Then, the aggregated indicator matrix is clustered by an algorithm combining density canopy and K-medoids. Together with the proposed scenario generation method, an optimal operation model of IES is established, where the objective is to minimize the annual operation costs considering carbon trading cost. Finally, case studies based on the data of Aachen, Germany in 2019 are performed. The results indicate that the adjusted rand index (ARI) and silhouette coefficient (SC) of the proposed method are 0.6153 and 0.6770, respectively, both higher than the traditional methods, namely K-medoids, K-means++, and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), which means the proposed method has better accuracy. The error between optimal operation results of the IES obtained by the proposed method and all-year time series benchmark value is 0.1%, while the calculation time is reduced from 11029 s to 188 s, which verifies that the proposed method can be used to optimize operation strategy of IES with high efficiency without loss of accuracy.

AB The increasing installment of distributed generations (DGs) and the tight coupling between active distribution system (ADS) and district heating system (DHS) enhance the flexibility of electricity-heat integrated energy system (IES) to participate in the operation of power transmission system. The operation of transmission system will be affected by distribution company (DISCO). In this paper, a collaborative optimal operation model of transmission system is proposed considering the interaction with the district electricity-heat integrated energy systems based on a semi-definite programming relaxation method. The optimal operation problem of ADS is modeled based on AC optimal power flow (ACOPF) with second order cone (SOC) relaxation, and network constraints of DHS are considered. An iterative semi-definite programming relaxation method is utilized to ensure the solution accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed model on improving the utilization rate of DGs and the economy is verified based on case studies.

AB Industrial parks have various sources and conversion forms of energy. The many uncertainties in the planning of industrial park integrated energy systems (IPIES) pose a great risk of regret in planning schemes; thus, an expansion planning method for an IPIES, considering regret aversion, is proposed. Based on comprehensive regret value consisting of min-max regret aversion and the min average regret value, the method optimizes the comprehensive cost of the expansion planning scheme in IPIES under different natural gas price fluctuation scenarios, including costs of construction, operation and maintenance, and environmental protection. A multi-stage expansion planning scheme and typical daily operation plans under multiple natural gas price fluctuation scenarios of the IPIES in an economic and technological development zone in southeast China are used to demonstrate the validity of the method. The results show that, compared with a traditional planning method based on expectation, the proposed expansion planning method could reduce the maximum regret value by 14% on average, and greatly reduces the risk of decision-making regret by up to 18%. At the same time, the influence of natural gas price on expansion planning of the IPIES is discussed.

AB Green hydrogen represents an important energy carrier for global decarbonization towards renewable-dominant energy systems. As a result, an escalating interdependency emerges between multi-energy vectors. Specifically, the coupling among power, natural gas, and hydrogen systems is strengthened as the injections of green hydrogen into natural gas pipelines. At the same time, the interaction between hydrogen and transportation systems would become indispensable with soaring penetrations of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. This paper provides a comprehensive review for the modeling and coordination of hydrogen-integrated energy systems. In particular, we analyze the role of green hydrogen in decarbonizing power, natural gas, and transportation systems. Finally, pressing research needs are summarized.

Both pipeline and power companies are drawing increasing attention to the voltage induction on pipelines caused by powerline currents. This paper proposes a novel active method for mitigating induced voltage along pipelines. This method employs controllable voltage generators to apply proper voltage to pipeline and mitigate the induced voltage from nearby power lines. The applied voltage can be adjusted by the embedded feedback controller according to the measured voltage. By solving the coordination and interference issues, the whole active mitigation system is established. This paper provides the case study, the experimental study and the results to show the capability of the proposed method.

AB The emergence of Integrated Energy Systems (IESs) has shifted energy management from traditional electricity paradigms to a more diverse approach involving electricity, thermal energy, and natural gas. This study introduces a framework for an Integrated Energy Network (IEN) that enables simultaneous trading across these interconnected markets. The objective is to maximize the profitability of integrated energy companies by optimizing energy trading strategies. The proposed business strategy incorporates integrated load response, addressing constraints within electric distribution systems, heating networks, and natural gas pipelines. A three- stage process is used: information sharing in the unified energy market, energy conversion in hubs, and flexible load planning in the retail market. Flexible loads are categorized as displaceable, reducible, or transformable. A Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) mean-variance model addresses market price volatility. Simulations on a test system validate the model, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving profitability and operational efficiency for integrated energy companies.

AB Over the past few centuries, coal has played a significant role in providing the world with the energy needed to encourage development. Since the 1990s, however, the environmental influence of the use of coal on the greenhouse effect and climate change has become a major concern to governments around the world. To explore the historic evolution of and the future trends in coal utilization, an optimized data analysis system (ODAS) based on research and environmental policies is proposed in this paper. Paradigm theory is adopted to explain the technological changes and the vital ecological coal utilization phases, and an imaginary no-coal-on-the ground integrated energy system is introduced as a future coal utilization development. The advantages of ecological coal utilization are examined to develop possible policies and directions to assist the coal industry move towards green, clean production. Examining coal utilization using the ecological paradigm allows for an accurate view of coal future, with integrated energy systems expected to be a significant new trend.

AB This paper proposes an individual-based model (IBM) for the modeling of large-scale heterogenous complex systems. The IBM decouples the complex systems into independent individuals based on physical characteristics. In order to formulate the actions of individuals and interactions between individuals, the IBM is formalized with a quintuple parameter set comprised of input, knowledge, state, function, and output sets. Accordingly, individuals can make decisions independently applying accurate evolutionary mechanisms described in the function set. Additionally, the individuals can interact with others by input and output sets in a uniform manner. Consequently, a complex system can be modelled by independent individuals whose internal characteristics are fully specified and hidden from the external environment. The IBM is applied to model heterogenous integrated energy systems (IES) and simulate the multi-time scale dynamics of the IES under conditions of disturbances and faults. The results show that the IBM are capable of simulating quantified system states and unquantified rules of the IES dynamics simultaneously. Furthermore, the IBM can significantly improve the computation efficiency in terms of computation time and interaction, compared with the traditional equal-step method. Therefore, it is verified that the proposed IBM is an efficient method for complex systems.

AB The intensifying worldwide trend toward carbon neutrality necessitates an increasing penetration of renewable energy generation with increased short-term insecurity and operational flexibility requirements. However, current expansion planning methods for integrated electric power and natural gas systems fail to consider short-term uncertainties and to account adequately for the multi-stage retirement of coal-fired power generators and reduction in carbon-emission caps. The present work addresses these issues by proposing a multi-stage expansion planning model for integrated electric power and natural gas systems, which relies on natural gas as a clean energy source to provide the operational flexibility required to ensure integrated system security under load growth uncertainties and short-term uncertainties in wind power output. The application of non-anticipativity constraints guarantees that long-term uncertainties are realized in stages rather than in complete blocks. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by numerical results involving two integrated energy systems of different scales, where the installed capacity of renewables and gas-fired power accounts for 45.0% and 35.4% of the total installed capacity at the planning year, respectively.

AB Integrated energy system is efficient and flexible in distributed energy supply, but the coupling of energy flows and the inaccuracy of prediction bring challenges to its economic operation. Peak shaving and demand management have become a necessary part of its operation method. In this paper, a cooperative dispatch method is proposed to optimize daily operations that consider the coupling characteristics of multi-energy flow in integrated energy systems. In addition, given the limitations of long-term and short-term prediction, a dynamic correction operation mode is proposed to improve the accuracy of the dispatch plan. In the case study, domestic hot water systems and charging piles are taken as dispatchable electricity demand, and indoor temperature is dispatchable cooling and heating demands. Electric energy storage is taken as the peak-shaving tool for electricity, and air conditioning circulation water is taken for cooling and heating. Based on this, daily operations over five winter days and five summer days are compared. The results show that, after applying this cooperative dispatch method, the energy supply costs are reduced by 10.82%, and carbon emissions are reduced by 9.71%. Meanwhile, the average energy efficiency is increased by 6.42%, and the average exergy loss rate is reduced by 5.46%.

AB In recent years, integrated energy systems with deep coupling of power, natural gas, and heat energy have gradually attracted extensive attention. The increasing issue of uncertainty in the generation and load of an integrated electric-gas-heat system (IEGHS) is a growing prominent problem. The effective implementation of demand response (DR) programs is an important way to solve this problem in the IEGHS. In this paper, a robust stochastic optimal dispatching method for an IEGHS with integrated DR (IDR) under multiple uncertainties is proposed. A robust adjustable uncertainty set is adopted to deal with the uncertainty of wind power. The Wasserstein generative adversarial network based on gradient normalization is proposed to generate load-side demand scenarios. Furthermore, an improved IDR model that considers the peak-valley difference cost of the electricity-gas-heat load is proposed. Finally, the simulation analysis successfully demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed model. By utilizing this approach, the system can obtain a scheduling scheme with the lowest operating cost even under worst-case scenarios.

AB To enhance the reliability of Integrated Energy Systems (IESs) and address the research gap in reliability-based planning methods, this paper proposes a two-stage robust planning model specifically for park-level IESs. The proposed planning model considers uncertainties like load demand fluctuations and equipment contingencies, and provides a reliable scheme of equipment selection and sizing for IES investors. Inspired by the unit commitment problem, we formulate an equipment contingency uncertainty set to accurately describe the potential equipment contingencies which happen and can be repaired within a day. Then, a modified nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm is applied to solve this two-stage robust planning model with integer recourse efficiently. In the case study, the role of energy storage system for IES reliability enhancement is analyzed in detail. Computational results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed model over other planning models in terms of improving reliability.

AB As the energy consumption in the world continues to increase, the integrated energy systems combined with multiple types of energy are gradually developing to enhance the utilization efficiency of each type of energy. However, some issues bring challenges to the state estimation of the coupled electric-gas integrated energy system. The issues include that measurement data of the integrated energy system has low redundancy, there exists a large measurement error of the integrated energy system, and the measurement devices of the electric and gas network are not standardized in terms of sampling time units. Considering that the data-driven model has high portability and the ability to distill and summarize information, the data-driven state estimation model of the electric-gas coupled integrated energy system is established in this paper. Bayesian learning is used to obtain the probabilistic statistical features of the measurement data. Super Latin sampling is applied to generate the complete measurement data. The rationality of the generated data is checked by the energy flow analysis of the integrated energy system to obtain the training sample set for the deep learning network. A hybrid deep learning network coupled with the convolutional neural network and long and short-term memory is proposed, and the root mean square error is utilized to train the hybrid deep learning network, which effectively improves the error accuracy of the state estimation of the electric-gas coupled integrated energy system. Compared with the classical model-driven method of state estimation, the arithmetic simulation verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB State estimation (SE) can provide real-time, reliable, and complete operating state of the systems, supporting the subsequent collaborative scheduling and safe operation with credible data. For the dynamic SE of electric-heat integrated energy systems (EH-IESs), a hybrid physics- and data-driven SE method is proposed in this article with the consideration of the transient operation characteristics of the district heating system (DHS) and the coupling relationship between the electric power system (EPS) and DHS. By integrating the physics-driven and data-driven methods, the linear SE model of DHSs is first established, which captures the transient transmission characteristics and parameter variation characteristics of heat in the pipeline and the topological structure characteristics of the system under the guidance of the first principles. To solve the dynamic SE problem of DHSs, a breadth-first search-based Kalman filter algorithm is developed, which is combined with the weighted least squares-based static SE of EPSs to realize the real-time SE of EH-IESs. Numerical results of three systems with different scales in MATLAB show that the proposed method can accurately and efficiently estimate the state of EH-IESs, and the robustness of the SE of EH-IESs is effectively enhanced by combining the SE of the EPS and DHS.

AB Incorporating solar energy technologies into integrated energy systems (IES) plays an increasingly important role to mitigate energy supply shortages and climate challenges. However, the low efficiency of solar energy utilization and land limitation for system deployment greatly restrict the development of the solar powered IESs. In this paper, a solar powered electricity, heating and hydrogen IES based on photovoltaic (PV), photothermal (PT) and photocatalysis of hydrogen production (PH) is proposed and investigated. The system comprises solar radiation spectrum splitting technology, PV, PT, PH, electric heating device, compressive heat pump, solid oxide fuel cell, absorption heat pump and energy storage components. A component sizing method based on a region contraction algorithm is employed to find the system optimal design with minimizing the cost of energy. Two scenarios of the solar powered IES based on solar spectrum splitting unit and independent energy supply unit are analyzed and compared. The results show that the solar powered IES can completely meet the electricity, heating and hydrogen energy demands and achieve cost savings for consumers. Compared to independent energy supply unit-based IES, the use of solar spectrum splitting unit can significantly improve the total energy efficiency by 21.74% and reduce the land area for solar capture by 52.5%, but increase the cost of energy by 27.3%.

AB Distributed thermal energy storage (DTES) provides specific opportunities to realize the sustainable and economic operation of urban electric heat integrated energy systems (UEHIES). However, the construction of the theory of the model and the configuration method of thermal storage for distributed application are still challenging. This paper analyzes the heat absorption and release process between the DTES internal heat storage medium and the heat network transfer medium, refines the relationship between heat transfer power and temperature characteristics, and establishes a water thermal energy storage and electric heater phase change thermal energy storage model, considering medium temperature characteristics. Combined with the temperature transmission delay characteristics of a heat network, a two-stage optimal configuration model of DTES for UEHIES is proposed. The results show that considering the temperature characteristics in the configuration method can accurately reflect the performance of DTES, enhance wind power utilization, improve the operation efficiency of energy equipment, and reduce the cost of the system.

AB Integrated energy systems can provide multiple products and reduce emissions with a higher energy efficiency through cascading utilization of energy. An internal combustion engine for cooling, heating and power production is proposed by feeding the exhaust gas to an absorption heat pump to satisfy the heating and cooling demands and to an organic Rankine Cycle-unit to produce power and hot water. The thermal models of components are constructed and validated. A modified techno-economic method is employed to analyze the specific cost of the energy products including a full life-cycle analysis. The result shows that the operating stage of the proposed system consumes the most of the fuel, the specific cost of electricity is the lowest 0.145 $/kWh, while the cost of cooling is the highest, 0.663 $/kWh. Compared to methods including techno-environmental and conventional methods with/without energy level, the modified method is reasonable to allocate life-cycle cost and the analysis shows that the electricity is the least sensitive one among total products, when changes the variables, such as service life and building load. This proposed techno-economic method considering life cycle equivalent emissions provide a new evaluation direction of energy systems with multiple products. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Dynamic simulation of thermal systems is crucial for their optimal control but facing the challenge of balancing calculation accuracy and efficiency, where numerically high-efficient and accurate heat exchanger (HX) modeling is a key. Herein, we propose a frequency domain model for HXs' dynamic simulation in the to meet this challenge. The governing equations of HXs are first converted to frequency domain through Fourier transform, and the analytical solution of the converted equations yields the frequency domain HX model in the form of transfer matrix that connects the inlet temperature variations and outlet temperature responses. Furthermore, integrating transfer matrices of HXs into the system's transfer matrix enables a high-efficiency thermal system simulation. Numerical cases of a single HX, a HX network, a district heating network, and a thermodynamic cycle are used to validate the developed method and demonstrate its efficacy by comparing it against finite difference/ volume method. Results show that the proposed method could reduce the calculation time by 2-3 orders of magnitude, and the maximum deviation of node temperature is around 1 K. The proposed method can be a powerful tool for the analysis of thermal systems and potentially integrated energy systems.

AB Integrated energy systems (IESs) are under development for a variety of benefits. District electricity and heating systems (DEHSs) deliver electricity and heat, the most common energy demands, to end-users. This paper studies the interactions in a DEHS considering the time-scale characteristics. Interaction mechanisms of a DEHS are analyzed. A disturbance in one system influences another system through coupling components, depending on the disturbance, operating characteristics, and control strategies. A model of the main components in DEHSs is presented. The time scale characteristics are studied based on a dynamic comparison of the different components. Then the interaction process is divided into four stages; each is a quasi-steady state. A quasi-steady multi-energy flow model is proposed and calculated, with a heating network node type transformation technique developed. A case study with detailed results and discussion of 3 types of disturbance is presented to verify the methods. The results present the interactions between the electricity and the system. It is suggested that attention should be paid both on the fast hydraulic process and slow thermal process for system security and economic operation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cloud computing platforms are critical cyber infrastructures in modern society. As the backbone of cloud systems, data centers act as large energy consumers in today's power grids. The integration of on-site renewable energy sources and energy storage systems further transforms data centers to be energy prosumers (producersand-consumers). As a result, optimizing data centers' energy production and consumption, and exploiting their potential of actively engaging in the external grid's planning, operation, and control has been drawing increasing attention in the last few years. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research efforts on integrated energy systems of data centers and smart grids. A taxonomy of such integration scenarios is provided. Consequently, this paper identifies several future application scenarios of integrating data centers and smart grids, which serves as a roadmap towards future research. This article is expected to provide a useful reference for researchers and engineers in the areas of energy systems and cloud computing.

AB Using multiple energy resources greatly enhances system operating flexibility and efficiency. An energy hub is a vital facility, producing, converting, and storing energy in different forms. Considering heat-power cogeneration and thermal storage capabilities, concentrating solar power (CSP) acts as an energy hub, building physical connections between the power distribution network (PDN) and the district heating network (DHN) in integrated energy systems. The CSP hub, the PDN, and the DHN are respectively formulated to model the economic dispatch of an integrated heat-power distribution system. The linearized DistFLOW model is used to describe the electrical power flow in the PDN. The hydraulic-thermal model is employed to formulate steady-state nodal temperature with constant mass flow rates. Both operating costs and carbon emissions are considered in the objective function, yielding mixed-integer programming with a convex quadratic objective and linear constraints that can be solved by commercial solvers. The effectiveness of the proposed model and the method are validated on a test system in terms of reducing operating costs, carbon emissions, and renewable spillage.

AB The proliferation of power-to-gas technology can propound a tailored platform to physically integrate power systems and natural gas grids. These integrated energy systems with different spatial-temporal properties not only could provide significant flexibilities to properly mitigate existing and imminent challenges, but also could increase the robustness of power systems in facing unpredicted conditions. Keeping this in mind, this article outlines a novel conservative two-stage model to improve the resilience of distribution systems against extreme hurricanes. To this end, at the first stage, a pre-disaster scheduling is executed to increase preparedness and robustness of the power system before approaching the tornado. The preparedness index is defined as the sum of energy stored in the electric vehicles and natural gas storages that should be maximized. Subsequently, at the second stage after the recognition of the tornado, some proactive post-disaster actions such as grid partitioning, network reconfiguration, demand-side management, and distributed series reactors are applied to minimize the degradation and vulnerability of the power system. An integrated gas and electricity power flow is proposed in a linear computationally efficient fashion capable of modeling the worst-case scenario. The effectiveness of the model is examined on a distribution grid with multiple energy hubs.

AB The increasing number of gas-fired units has significantly intensified the coupling between electric and gas power networks. Traditionally, nonlinearity and nonconvexity in gas flow equations, together with renewable-induced stochasticity, resulted in a computationally expensive model for unit commitment in electricity-gas coupled integrated energy systems (IES). To accelerate stochastic day-ahead scheduling, we applied and modified Progressive Hedging (PH), a heuristic approach that can be computed in parallel to yield scenario-independent unit commitment. Through early termination and enumeration techniques, the modified PH algorithm saves considerable computational time for certain generation cost settings or when the scale of the IES is large. Moreover, an adapted second-order cone relaxation (SOCR) is utilized to tackle the nonconvex gas flow equation. Case studies were performed on the IEEE 24-bus system/Belgium 20-node gas system and the IEEE 118-bus system/Belgium 20-node gas system. The computational efficiency when employing PH is 188 times that of commercial software, and the algorithm even outperforms Benders Decomposition. At the same time, the gap between the PH algorithm and the benchmark is less than 0.01% in both IES systems, which proves that the solutions produced by PH reach acceptable optimality in this stochastic UC problem.

AB The increasing share of variable renewable energy sources and the improving requirements on system security and reliability are calling for important changes in the integrated energy systems. Hence this paper proposes a multi-stage contingency-constrained co-planning model for electricity-gas systems interconnected with gas-fired units and power-to-gas plants considering the uncertainties of load demand and wind power. The proposed model considers the long-term co-planning for electricity-gas systems with the short-term operation constraints and N-1 reliability criterion, which is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem. First, a scenario reduction method based on affinity propagation clustering is utilized to handle the uncertainties. Afterwards, the N-1 criterion is tackled by a contingency screening method based on line outage distribution factors. Finally, an iterative Benders decomposition method is developed to divide the programming problem into one master investment problem and three subproblems. The iterative process will continue between master problem and each subproblem until an economic, reliable and fuel-supply feasible solution is obtained. In order to verify the feasibility of the proposed model and the effectiveness of the proposed method, case studies are conducted on two different scales of electricity-gas systems.

AB This paper tackles the exergo-economic assessment of two integrated energy systems that allow the building heating demand to be achieved; a solar assisted heat pump using ice storage and an ambient air heat pump with photovoltaic panels. These systems are firstly described and their performance is discussed for various surfaces of solar collectors and photovoltaic panels. To this purpose, the total electrical energy consumption and the total cost are estimated while the total exergy destruction is divided according to renewable and non-renewable energy flows. This latter, which is really paid by the user, then serves as the exergy performance indicator. The ambient air heat pump with photovoltaic panels is found as the optimal solution from energy and economic perspectives while the solar assisted heat pump using ice storage provides the best exergy performance. To help analyze results, the system performance is illustrated by using an exergy diagram, where energy terms are shown on the abscise axis and energy quality factors are on the ordinate axis. This 2-D graphical representation, which can consider the results from dynamic analyses, helps understand the system operation and performance, and reveals the sources (components), the reasons (energy loss and/or energy potential factor degradation) and the nature (renewable, non-renewable flows) of irreversibility.

AB The creation of intelligent integrated energy systems with active consumers and distributed control functions, using renewable energy sources together with conventional generation, is a promising alternative to the existing conventional energy systems of a hierarchical structure. At the same time, such systems face the challenge of the balance between centralized and distributed energy generation. One should take into account the ratio of energy supplied to the system from distributed sources to that from centralized sources because, otherwise, energy sources can operate inefficiently, which in turn will increase the cost of energy production and can cause problems in the operation of energy equipment and the energy system as a whole. This necessitates the harmonization of operating conditions of centralized and distributed energy resources. The multi-agent approach is oftentimes used to model an integrated energy system; it allows such a technologically complex system to be represented as a set of agents with their own individual behavior. Agents interact with each other to find and optimize solutions and achieve the goals they set within the system. The proposed multi-agent model of the real life energy supply system of a residential area (with centralized and distributed energy resources) was implemented in a specialized software environment. Computational studies of the integrated energy system conducted using the multi-agent model developed by the authors allowed us to formulate the principles of interaction between centralized and distributed energy generation.

AB The energy hub is considered a unit where multiple energy carriers can be converted, conditioned, and stored, thereby providing the functions of input, output, conversion, and storage of multiple energy carriers using a defined coupling matrix. Thus, the energy hub is widely used in the planning and operation of integrated energy systems. However, the coupling factors (or the efficiencies of the energy conversion devices) in the energy hub coupling matrix are usually assumed to be constant for the sake of simplicity, which may result in unreasonable planning and operation schemes for the integrated energy system. For this reason, an integrated energy system planning method at the community level that considers varying coupling factors was developed in this study. First, a dynamic energy hub model was developed, where an efficiency correction model was built to determine the time-varying coupling factors with the variation in load rate. On this basis, a double-layer planning model was built to determine the optimal planning and operation schemes for the integrated community energy system. A typical integrated community energy system was employed as a test system to illustrate the effectiveness of the planning method, and the results were analysed.

AB The demand for environmental protection and energy utilization transformation has promoted the rapid development of integrated energy systems (IES). Reliability evaluation is a fundamental element in designing IES as it could instruct the planning and operation of IES. This study proposes a novel data-driven reliability improvement and evaluation method considering the three-state reliability model and an optimal service restoration model (OSR). First, a multi-energy flow model is introduced and linearized in order to reduce the computing complexity. Next, a three-state reliability model is developed, considering the transitional process and partial failure mode. Furthermore, an optimal service restoration model is established to determine the best repairment moment for minimizing the load curtailment, and a data-driven reliability evaluation method is developed that integrates OSR and models the stochastic state transition process using the historical measurement data of the smart meters. Finally, the proposed reliability evaluation method is tested on a test IES, and the numerical results validate its effectiveness in evaluating the reliability of IES and improving the overall reliability.

AB Integrated heat and electricity dispatch is crucial to exploit synergistic benefits from integrated energy systems. However, this requires information from both electricity systems and district heating systems (DHSs), which are managed by an electricity control center (ECC) and district heating control centers (DHCCs), respectively. For reasons pertaining to privacy, communication, dimension, and compatibility, it is not practical for DHCCs to send detailed models to the ECC. Therefore, a new feasible region method is proposed for formulation of new DHS models, which exploit the flexibility of DHSs with consideration of building thermal inertia. A greedy method is developed to solve the new modified feasible region models by calculating a series of linear programming problems efficiently. Then the new models are sent to the ECC to be used in central dispatch considering DHS operation constraints, i.e. integrated heat and electricity dispatch. The modified models are similar to conventional power plants and storages, and are thus compatible with current dispatch programs. Case studies verify the effectiveness of the method. Although some conservativeness exists, the total cost and wind energy curtailment are both decreased compared to conventional decoupled dispatch. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Multienergy load forecasting (MELF) is the premise of regional integrated energy systems (RIES) production planning and energy dispatch. The key of MELF is the consideration of multienergy coupling and the improvement of prediction accuracy. Therefore, a MELF method considering the multienergy coupling of variation characteristic curves (MELF_MECVCC) for RIES is proposed. The novelty of MELF_MECVCC lies in the following three aspects. 1) For the trend stripping and volatility extraction of multienergy load time series, the extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition-sample entropy (ESMD-SE) method is introduced to decompose and reconstruct the variation characteristic curves of multienergy, including trend curve and fluctuation curve. 2) The multienergy coupling of the variation characteristic curves is considered to reflect the variation characteristics of the multienergy loads. 3) Different methods are applied according to different variation characteristics; i.e., the combined method based on multitask learning and long short-term memory network (MTL-LSTM) is applied to predict the trend curve with strong correlation and the least square support vector regression (LSSVR) method is applied to predict the fluctuation curve with strong volatility and high complexity. Based on the actual data set of the University of Texas in Austin, the MELF_MECVCC model is simulated and verified, which shows that the model reduces the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) and fits better with the original load and has higher prediction accuracy, compared with current advanced algorithms.

AB In recent years, the increasing penetration of non-programmable renewable energy technologies has made energy system flexibility essential for ensuring power grid stability, in terms of balance between power demand and supply. In particular, cogeneration plants can provide flexibility services by making a defined amount of power available at a given schedule, upon request. The grid operator can request it or not depending on the actual dispatch management. In the presence of this uncertain request, producers need smart controllers to meet thermal demand and, at the same time, to maximize profit while fulfilling the needs of the grid. This work presents a hierarchical predictive control architecture for optimal management of combined heat and power production sites equipped with a thermal energy storage tank supplying district heating networks. The feasibility of the proposed approach is investigated by simulating several scenarios with different degrees of uncertainty about the actual power request from the grid operator. It is shown that the controlled system is able to comply with the requirements to the maximum extent when the exact power dispatch is known a few hours in advance, also giving a profit increase as well as environmental benefits. While the grid operator request for flexibility is met up to 100%, the reduction in carbon emissions ranges from 3% to 7% and the operating margin is increased by 20%. This can be realized when the power availability is scheduled at periods of both maximum and minimum heat demand. Thus, the method is promising also in improving production planning of future integrated energy systems from the perspective of grid flexibility.

AB With the ever-growing integration of diverse distributed energy resources, modern district energy sectors are transitioning into integrated energy systems (IESs), which generally consist of various energy carriers such as electric power, natural gas, and heat. Instead of modeling individual energy carriers, the emergence of IESs requires comprehensive consideration of all involved energy systems in both planning and operation phases. This paper proposes a comprehensive planning strategy for a district energy sector to address the challenges of IES planning considering the coupling of power, gas, and heat systems. The proposed planning model contains an operational module that develops a steady-state optimal multi-energy flow (OMEF) for the IES considered and a multi-stage expansion module that optimizes the investment decisions. To efficiently solve the proposed planning model, which is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, an improved generalized Benders decomposition algorithm that utilizes dynamic dual multipliers to improve the convergence speed is employed. The effectiveness of the proposed planning model and the feasibility of the improved Benders decomposition algorithm are verified in case studies.

AB Optimal scheduling strategy of integrated energy systems (IES) with combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) has become increasingly important. In order to make the scheduling strategy fit to the practical implementation, this paper proposes a variable performance parameters temperature-flowrate scheduling model for IES with CCHP. The novel scheduling model is established by taking flowrate and temperature as decision variables directly. In addition, performance parameters are treated as variables rather than constants in the proposed model. Specifically, the efficiencies of the gas turbine and the waste heating boiler are estimated with the partial load factor, and the coefficient of performance (COP) of the electrical chillers and heat pumps are estimated with the partial load factor and outlet water temperature. Then, to deal with the model nonlinearities caused by considering the variability of COPs, the COP-expansion method is developed by adopting a specific representation of the COP and the expansion of the outlet water temperature. Finally, case studies show that the variable performance parameters' temperature-flowrate scheduling model can account for the variation of performance parameters, especially the impacts of water temperature and the part load factor on the COP. Therefore, the proposed scheduling model can obtain more adequate and feasible operation strategy, thereby suggesting its applicability in engineering practice.

AB The dynamic characteristics of thermal energy play an important role of multi-scale coupling among heterogeneous energy sources in integrated energy systems (IES). In Part I, for the purpose of accurately describing the dynamic processes of thermal energy transmission, the theoretical approach and models were proposed and verified by numerical simulation. In this part, an innovative analytical method based on entropy flow was derived on the basis of theory developed in Part I, which can assess the quantity and quality of thermal transport. A comparative case study indicates that the change trend of entropy flow of each node is consistent with the change of available power, but independent of temperature. The node entropy flow is increased compared with the algebraic sum of branch entropy flow, which reflects the phenomenon of entropy generation in the mixing process; while the change of available power is just the opposite. This means the irreversible entropy generation at the node leads to loss of the available thermal power. Therefore, it is more accurate to describe the dynamic thermal transmission process on the scale of entropy. This proves the effectiveness of the models proposed in Part I as well as the methods in this part from the perspective of application.

AB Modern building complexes have simultaneous heating and cooling demands. Therefore, integrated energy systems with heat pumps and long-term thermal storage are a promising solution. An integrated heating and cooling system for a building complex in Oslo, Norway was analyzed in this study. The main components of the system were heat pumps, solar thermal collectors, storage tanks, ice thermal energy storage, and borehole thermal energy storage. Dynamic simulation models were developed in Modelica with focus on the long-term thermal energy storage. One year measurement data was used to calibrate the system model and two COPs were defined to evaluate system performance. The simulation results showed that more heat had to be extracted from the long-term thermal storage during winter than could be injected during summer. This imbalance led to a decrease in ground temperature (3 degrees C after 5 years) and decreasing long-term performance of the system: both COPs decreased by 10% within five years. This performance decrease could be avoided by increasing the number of solar collectors from 140 to 830 or by importing more heat from the local district heating system. Both measures led to sustainable operation with a balanced long-term thermal storage.

AB With synergies among multiple energy sectors, integrated energy systems (IESs) have been recognized lately as an effective approach to accommodate large-scale renewables and achieve environmental sustainability. The core of IES operation is to keep energy balance between supply and demand, where accurate load forecasting serves as one of the most crucial cornerstones. Recent advances in data-driven techniques have spawned a whole new branch of solution for load forecasting in IESs, which urges the need for a timely review accordingly. First, this overview reveals the uniqueness of the IES load forecasting problem compared with the conventional problem in electric power systems. The influential factors are much more complicated and volatile, while multivariate load series are forecasted simultaneously to address the coupling among different energy sectors. This uniqueness has contributed to increasing works and early breakthroughs for the IES load forecasting problem. Then, following the application and implementation procedures, essential issues of data-driven techniques in current works are reviewed with respect to the IES settings such as the variable decision, data preparation, feature engineering, model identification, and augmentation strategy adoption. The procedures are summarized according to current works and have covered all of the effective solutions for accurate forecasts. Finally, future trends and prospects of advanced topics therein are identified beyond current breakthroughs. Compatible with the distributed structure of IESs, federated learning is a promising solution for coordinated load forecasting among diverse energy sectors. On the other hand, automated machine learning builds deep learning and other data-driven models more intelligently to extremely improve load forecasting in complex IESs. The limited data issue in IESs also warrants further research efforts.

AB District heating technology has prompted the development of integrated energy systems, where energy flow models have been widely used. However, as heating networks become complicated, the traditional mass flow model fails to provide efficient solutions. This study proposes a novel heating flow model based on nodal pressure in heating networks. First, transmission models based on nodal pressure are formulated. Subsequently, nodal conservation models of mass and heating flow are developed. Further, the transmission and nodal conservation models are combined, and thereby nodal pressure and user load are directly correlated. As the number of variables depends only on the nodes, the resulting model is more efficient at adapting to new network connections when the nodes do not change. Moreover, as loop pressure conservation equations are omitted in this model, fewer iterations are required. Owing to the small relative fluctuations of nodal pressure, initial iteration values can be set more effectively in the solution of the proposed model. A case study was conducted, and it was demonstrated that compared with the traditional mass flow model, the proposed model is more effective in adapting to varying network topologies, and the computational burden is significantly reduced. Moreover, the proposed model can be efficiently applied for analyzing energy transmission loss as well as system planning in integrated powergasheat energy systems.

AB The operation of community integrated energy systems (CIESs) is challenging because it is necessary to couple energy production, conversion and consumption on the end-user side. Multiple energy demands need to be fed simultaneously with the goal of economy and reliability. This paper formulates the optimal scheduling problem based on a real community integrated energy system in China. The system has multiple chillers (i.e. three ground source heat pumps, two conventional water-cooled chillers and two double-duty chillers) and two types of thermal storage devices (i.e. two cold water tanks and an ice-storage tank). Based on detailed device modeling, a community integrated energy system operation strategy considering unit commitment is proposed, and then is transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming model by linearization of nonlinear items. Case studies are conducted based on the data for a typical day in summer. The results show that the proposed strategy can utilize the flexibility of the energy storage devices and realize an economic and reliable operation of the community integrated energy system by coordinating various energy devices. The strategy can also reduce the startup/shutdown frequency of chillers significantly.

TI Novel Data-Driven decentralized coordination model for electric vehicle

AB Energy hub (EH) is an independent entity that benefits to the efficiency, flexibility, and reliability of integrated energy systems (IESs). On the other hand, the rapid emerging of electric vehicles (EVs) drives the EV aggregator (EVAGG) as another independent entity to facilitate the electricity exchange with the grid. However, due to privacy consideration for different owners, it is challenging to investigate the optimal coordinated strategies for such interconnected entities only by exchanging the information of electrical energy. Besides, the existence of parameter uncertainties (load demands, EVs' charging behaviors, wind power and photovoltaic generation), continuous decision space, dynamic energy flows, and non-convex multi-objective function is difficult to solve. To this end, this paper proposes a novel model-free multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based decentralized coordination model to minimize the energy costs of EH entities and maximize profits of EVAGGs. First, a long short-term memory (LSTM) module is used to capture the future trend of uncertainties. Then, the coordination problem is formulated as Markov games and solved by the attention enabled MADRL algorithm, where the EH or EVAGG entity is modeled as an adaptive agent. An attention mechanism makes each agent only focus on state information related to the reward. The proposed MADRL adopts the forms of offline centralized training to learn the optimal coordinated control strategy, and decentralized execution to enable agents' online decisions to only require local measurements. A safety network is employed to cope with equality constraints (demand-supply balance). Simulation results illustrate that the proposed method achieves similar results compared to the traditional model-based method with perfect knowledge of system models, and the computation performance is at least two orders of magnitudes shorter than the traditional method. The testing results of the proposed method are better than those of the Concurrent and other MADRL method, with 10.79%/3.06% lower energy cost and 17.11%/6.82% higher profits of aggregator. Besides, the electric equality constraint of the proposed method is only 0.25 MW averaged per day, which is a small and acceptable violation.

AB The current works aim is performance improvement of different integrated energy systems towards net-zero energy which is driven by a set of Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) through adding some components like fuel cell and thermoelectric generator (TEG) in new arrangements introduced and analyzed. The novelty of the present work is the proposal of the new arrangement of energy conversion systems. In this study the basic cycle (cycle 1) is including an ICE, Kalina cycle, Humidification and Dehumidification (HDH) unit, in cycle 2, the HDH is eliminated while a fuel cell is added to the system and in the cycle 3, in addition to fuel cell and having HDH unit in the system, a thermoelectric generator (TEG) has been used instead of condenser to recover more wasted thermal energy. The performance of all proposed systems is analyzed from energy, exergy, and exergo-economic aspects. It is demonstrated that from an energetic viewpoint, cycle 3 has the better performance with an energy efficiency, and net output power of 37% and 391.7 kW, respectively. That is while from an exergetic viewpoint cycle 2 with exergy destruction of 257.1 kW has superior exergetic performance. The results of current work can provide a precise basis for designing an efficient energy system with a higher thermal performance. (c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB The closer interdependency of subsystems in integrated energy systems (IESs) and the continuous increase of electricity/gas/heat loads have brought great challenges to the stable operation of IESs. In response to the static voltage stability problem of IESs, this paper proposes a composite voltage stability index (CVSI) based on the minimum eigenvalue of a reduced Jacobian matrix and the known L-index. First, a unified multi-energy flow model for integrated electrical, natural gas and heating system is established, which comprises the steadystate modeling of each energy subsystem and coupling components in IESs. Then, an integrated multi-energy flow calculation method based on the Newton-Raphson algorithm is developed to solve the unified steadystate model of IESs. On the basis, the unified Jacobian matrix after multi-energy flow convergence can be obtained. Moreover, a reduced Jacobian matrix considering the impacts of multi-energy state variables on the reactive power of electrical power system (EPS) is constructed. Afterward, the CVSI is proposed, which combines the minimum eigenvalue of the constructed reduced Jacobian matrix and the L-index derived from bus voltage calculation formula. The proposed CVSI takes both the voltage stability margin of whole system and the voltage stability of electrical buses into consideration. Finally, numerical simulations are exploited to verify the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed voltage stability index.

AB Uncertainty is a common and critical problem for planning the capacity and operation of integrated energy systems (IESs). This study evaluates the effects of uncertainties on the capacity and operation of an IES. To this aim, system planning and operation with uncertainties are optimized by a two-stage stochastic programming model and compared with a referencing deterministic case. Specifically, the uncertainties of photovoltaic (PV) generation and energy demand are investigated.
   Regarding system capacity, a larger energy storage capacity is needed to accommodate a higher uncertainty. The superimposed uncertainties have a higher effect on system capacity than the sum of the effect of each uncertainty. The uncertainty of energy demand has a higher impact than the uncertainty of PV generation.
   Regarding system operation, the increase in operation cost is smaller than the increase in investment cost and total cost. In addition, the average flexibility provided by the energy storage increases with uncertainty and uncertainties affect the change rate for power charging/discharging of the electric energy storage. Regarding the effect on the grid, the uncertainties increase not only the magnitude of ramping-rate, but also the frequency of power-dispatch.

AB Integrated demand response (IDR) is an important approach to promote renewable energy consumption and improve energy efficiency in integrated energy systems. In IDR, not only multi-energy users, but also demand side energy stations, can become demand response resources. Hence, making full use of the flexibility of energy supply and the elasticity of electricity and heat demand is vital to the development of IDR. In this paper, based on the background of the electricity-heat integrated energy system, the precise models of typical controllable electric and heat load are constructed considering the user's requirements for comfort. Based on the model, the electricity-heat coordinated retail market framework is proposed to achieve the coordinated clearing of electric and heat load, managing the district energy generation and consumption through transactive control methods. The bidding strategies for electric and heat load are established for customers to participate in the market. The market clearing rules are defined with the aim of maximizing the net revenue of integrated energy service agency to realize the optimal energy allocation of energy station devices. Finally, the case study demonstrates that the proposed method can optimize both the resource allocation of demand-side energy stations and the energy use of customers through economic means. About 80-90% of wind power can be absorbed through participation in market bidding, and the specific consumption rate depends on the type of energy stations and users' demand. By guiding customers to consume energy reasonably during different market clearing periods, the energy expenditure can be reduced by 18.76% on average under the premise that the users' comfort is guaranteed.

AB There are multiple energy demands in industrial parks. The industrial park's energy system includes a variety of energy sources and energy-consuming equipment, with diverse load types and high reliability requirements for power supplies. And the situation of low energy utilization rates, unreasonable energy structures, great peak-to-valley power differences and the environment pollution needs to be improved. The application of multi-energy complementary regional integrated energy systems (RIES) can improve the performance of the industrial parks. Considering reasonable correspondence between the energy supply and demand in RIES, this paper proposes an RIES energy management strategy based on energy stepped utilization to further minimize the daily cost and make full use of the energy. Additionally, the piecewise linear model of gas turbine is established considering a part load ratio. According to the grade demands, the heat loads are divided into high-grade, middle-grade and low-grade heat loads and the load models are respectively established. The scenario reduction method is used to obtain typical scenarios in order to describe the randomness of weather factors. Finally, the simulation analysis shows that the proposed energy management method for the RIES can arrange the combination of gas turbines and output of devices more flexibly, and a more economical scheduling plan can be provided by this method. The high-grade and middle-grade energy are not only supplied to corresponding loads, but also can be converted into low-grade energy. Additionally, the stability and energy efficiency of the system are improved with the application of this strategy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate multi-load forecasting is a crucial prerequisite for the steady and effective on-demand operation of integrated energy systems. Due to the intricate interdependencies between different energy sources and spatial and temporal dynamic variations, however, existing methodologies often struggle with data integration, model complexity, and capturing cross-energy correlations. To address these issues, the multi-energy load forecasting problem is transformed into a hierarchical multi-task learning task, resolved by using a spatiotemporal attention mechanism and a gated temporal convolutional network. Initially, the coupling relationships between different energy sources are analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively to identify the coupling relationships between different energy loads. Subsequently, the identified couplings serve as guidance for designing a hierarchical multi-task learning network by distinguishing between relevant and less relevant loads. Moreover, by incorporating spatiotemporal attention, a gated temporal convolutional network with hierarchical structure is devised to achieve multi-task learning. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through multi-energy consumption data spanning 14 months from an energy management system. Compared to the several baseline methods, the proposed method reduces the mean absolute percentage error by up to 25.09%, 25.96%, and 17.46% on cooling, heating, and electrical load forecasting tasks. The positive experimental results and interpretable analysis demonstrate the promising application prospects of the proposed method in multi-energy load forecasting and demand-side management.

AB Integrated energy systems (IESs) have become a new transition for the traditional electricity industry. In the context of energy mix, end-users participating markets should consider diverse energy mix. Therefore, this paper proposes a day-ahead integrated energy market structure that allows electricity, heat energy and natural gas to trade simultaneously. Aiming at the maximal profit of integrated energy company (IECO) in the market, an optimal trading strategy based on integrated demand response (IDR) is optimized considering complex energy flow constraints of power distribution system, heat system and natural gas system. In this model, the IDR can be carried out based on three steps, i.e. information sharing of the integrated energy market, energy conversion of Energy Hub (EH) and flexible loads scheduling in the retail market. In particular, flexible loads are classified into shiftable loads, reducible loads and convertible loads according to their characteristics. Furthermore, a conditional value-at-risk based mean-variance portfolio model is set up to address the uncertain market prices. Finally, simulation results on a test system with a 33-bus power distribution system, an 11-node natural gas system and a 6-node District Heat System (DHS) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

AB The current research presents the thermodynamic modeling and assessment of the solar-based integrated energy systems (IES) for hydrogen production with and without thermoelectric generators (TEGs) waste heat recovery system (WHRS). The results show that the net output power of the conventional system is 66.9 kW and 14 kW more power can be generated by using the TEGs WHRS in the IES. The net output power of the proposed system reaches 78.7 kW, indicating an enhancement by 17.6%. Also, increasing output power leads to an increase in the efficiency of IES from 6.9% to 8.1%. It means that, with the use of WHRS the efficiency is increased by 1.2%. However, more increase in efficiency is observed in the proposed system, and the variations of efficiency relative to the mass flow rate of the collector are extremely slight in the conventional system. Moreover, modeling results demonstrate that the hydrogen production rate in the proposed system is approximately 16% more than that in the conventional system. Furthermore, if the figure of merit is increased from 0.001 1/K to 0.009 1/K, a significant enhancement from 0.4% to 1.9% (for TEGs WHRS efficiency) could be achieved. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB For a steam heating network (SHN), which is one of the most important parts of the integrated energy systems in an industrial park, it is essential to provide accurate and reliable estimation of hydraulic and thermal states, to ensure its operational safety and economy. Considering two different time-scale characteristics of the hydraulic and thermal processes in the SHN, this article proposes a mechanism and data-driven dual estimation method for the coupling hydraulic-thermal dynamic states. Due to the fact that the existing coupled estimation methods with one time scale may suffer from heavy computational burden, a data-driven dual sequential DSE method of the SHN is proposed based on the two-time scales, in which the dynamics of slow thermal states can also be captured when performing the SE of the fast hydraulic process. Furthermore, to improve the computational and communicational efficiency, a distributed interaction strategy based on the nodal transformation matrix is designed for large-scale steam systems. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a single pipeline system and two real-world industrial superheated steam networks are employed. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method achieves the best tradeoff between the estimation accuracy and computational efficiency.

AB Demand-side management is very critical in China's energy systems because of its high fossil energy consumption and low system energy efficiency. A building shape factor is introduced in describing the architectural characteristics of different functional areas, which are combined with the characteristics of the energy consumed by users to investigate the features of heating load in different functional areas. A Stackelberg game-based optimal scheduling model is proposed for electro-thermal integrated energy systems, which seeks to maximize the revenue of integrated energy operator (IEO) and minimize the cost of users. Here, IEO and users are the Stackelberg game leader and followers, respectively. The leader uses real-time energy prices to guide loads to participate in demand response, while the followers make energy plans based on price feedback. Using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition and the big-M method, the model is transformed into a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem, which is solved by using MATLAB and CPLEX software. The results demonstrate that the proposal manages to balance the interests of IEO and users. Furthermore, the heating loads of public and residential areas can be managed separately based on the differences in energy consumption and building shape characteristics, thereby improving the system operational flexibility and promoting renewable energy consumption.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel game model based on the hierarchical Stackelberg game for analyzing the multiple energies trading (MET) problem in integrated energy systems (IESs). In the proposed game model, a number of distributed energy stations (DESs) lead the game deciding the unit prices of electricity and cooling energies they generated, while multiple energy users (EUs) perform as followers determining the amounts of energies to consume. In addition to maximizing the profit of each DES, the proposed hierarchical game model also considers the benefit of each EU, who actively participates in the MET. We prove that, for the first time, there exists a unique Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE) in the MET, so that the existence of an equilibrium strategy optimizing the objectives of all participants can be guaranteed. Moreover, we found that the price setting game played by DESs is a submodular game when energy dispatching is performed during their generation process, which indicates that the behaviors of DESs are strategic substitutes. Furthermore, the SE is obtained in a closed-form, by which the effects of coupling generation of multiple energies are analyzed. Finally, a best response algorithm is provided to obtain the SE in an iterative way. Numerical studies demonstrate the convergency of the proposed best response algorithm, corroborate the jointly effects of market scale and exogenous parameter on the SE and verify the practicability of the proposed game-theoretic approach.

AB Recent energy systems have witnessed a large number of extreme weather events due to the global climate change, resulting in severe damages and economic losses. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-stage stochastic programming model for resilient integrated electricity and natural gas distribution systems under typhoon natural disasters. A three-stage modeling is employed to quantify the system resilience against the dynamic process of a typhoon, where the network reinforcement, network reconfiguration, and network repairing are coordinated. Moreover, the interaction between the power system and natural gas system during a typhoon attack is reflected in this model. To address the uncertainties introduced by the typhoon moving paths, non-anticipativtity constraints are adopted in the proposed multi-stage stochastic programming model. Case studies on a 33-bus-48-node and a 144-bus-85-node integrated electricity and natural gas distribution systems verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results of the case studies show that the current IEGDS is still fragile when facing natural disasters, and building a resilient IEGDS to recover from natural disasters rapidly is meaningful in recent vigorous trends of developing integrated energy systems. By applying the proposed model, the proposed model and strategies can enable the IEGDS to reduce the load curtailment by about 52%, and the total economic loss will be reduced by 54%.

AB High-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT-PEMFC) is promising in the next-generation integrated energy systems, because of its reliability, controllability and high-grade exhaust heat which enables the operation of combined heating, cooling and power generation (CCHP). However, the conventional HT-PEMFC based CCHPs suffers from the electric-thermal coupling, which is incompatible with the varying electricity and heating/cooling loads. To this end, a double-effect absorption heating/cooling cogeneration cycle (DACC) is proposed to decouple the production of electricity and heating/cooling, by flexibly adjusting the ratio of the vapor distributed to the branches of turbine and evaporator. The mathematical model is developed and validated, based on which the parametric analysis is characterized under different conditions. Under the heating cogeneration mode, the overall efficiency of the system is improved by 5.9-26.2% compared with the single HTPEMFC. The maximum overall efficiency is 0.4797, corresponding the current density of 0.23 A/cm2. Under the cooling cogeneration mode, the system cooling capacity, net power, and cooling/power ratio can be adjusted in the range of 17.78-137.55 kW, 77.46-156.3 kW and 0.19-1.21, respectively. Owing to the flexible adjustment ability, the HT-PEMFC-DACC system can serve as an effective solution in future zero-carbon distributed energy systems.

AB Optimal design of regional integrated energy systems (RIES) offers great potential for better managing energy sources, lower costs and reducing environmental impact. To capture the transition process from fossil fuel to renewable energy, a flexible RIES, including the traditional energy system (TES) based on the coal and biomass based distributed energy system (BDES), was designed to meet a regional multiple energy demand. In this paper, we analyze multiple scenarios based on a new rural community in Dalian (China) to capture the relationship among the energy supply cost, increased share of biomass, system configuration transformation, and renewable subsidy according to regional CO2 emission abatement control targets. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model was developed to find the optimal solutions. The results indicated that a 40.58% increase in the share of biomass in the RIES was the most cost-effective way as compared to the separate TES and BDES. Based on the RIES with minimal cost, by setting a CO2 emission reduction control within 40%, the RIES could ensure a competitive total annual cost as compared to the TES. In addition, when the reduction control exceeds 40%, a subsidy of 53.83 to 261.26 RMB/t of biomass would be needed to cover the extra cost to further increase the share of biomass resource and decrease the CO2 emission.

AB The present study of the district heating (DH) system in the city of Kisa, Sweden, shows how, through energy cooperation with a nearby sawmill and paper mill, a local energy company contributes to energy efficient DH and cost-effective utilization of a new biofuel combined heat and power (CHP) plant. Cases of stand-alone and integrated energy systems are optimized with the linear program MODEST. The European power market is assumed to be fully deregulated. The results show clear advantages for the energy company to cooperate with these industries to produce heat for DH and process steam for industry. The cooperating industries gain advantages from heat and/or biofuel by-product supply as well. The opening to use a biofuel CHP plant for combined heat supply results in cogenerated electricity of almost 29 GWh/a with an increased biofuel use of 13 GWhia, zero fuel oil use and CO2 emission reductions of 25,800 tons CO2/a with coal-condensing power plant on the margin and biofuel as limited resource. The total system cost decreases by -2.18 MEUR/a through extended cooperation and renewable electricity sales. The sensitivity analysis shows that the profitability of investing in a biofuel CHP plant increases with higher electricity and electricity certificate prices. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The effective planning of energy stations and networks is critical for improving the economic and energy performance of regional integrated energy systems. Based on the principle of minimizing investment cost and network losses, this study proposes a novel methodology involving both kernel density estimation and shortest path methods to optimize the transmission network. The optimal locations of energy supply and storage stations are determined according to the kernel density of the annual energy consumption of building groups and the annual energy output of energy stations in the kernel density estimation method, respectively. The shortest path method using the Astar search algorithm with a screening algorithm is used to optimize the distribution of energy networks. The proposed methodology is verified by a hypothetical region from literature. The modified energy station and network planning methodology based on kernel density hotspots can reduce the total network length by 21.3%. Moreover, the proposed methodology can be applied easily and effectively to select the locations of the energy stations and determine the distribution of the energy networks in a regional integrated energy system.

AB Integrated energy systems (IESs) are developing rapidly as a supporting technology for achieving carbon reduction targets. Accurate IES predictions can facilitate better scheduling strategies. Recently, a newly developed unsupervised machine learning tool, known as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), has been used to predict renewable energy outputs and various types of loads for its advantage in that no prior assumptions about data distribution are required. However, the structure of the traditional GAN leads to the problem of uncontrollable generations, which can be improved in deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN). We propose a two-step prediction approach that takes DCGAN to achieve higher accuracy generation results and uses a K-means clustering algorithm to achieve scenario reduction. In terms of scheduling strategies, common two-stage scheduling is generally day-ahead and intraday stages, with rolling scheduling used for the intraday stage. To account for the impacts on the prediction accuracy of scheduling results, Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is added to the day-ahead stage. The intra-day prediction process has also been improved to ensure that the inputs for each prediction domain are updated in real-time. The simulations on a typical IES show that the proposed two-step scenario prediction approach can better describe the load-side demands and renewable energy outputs with significantly reduced computational complexity and that the proposed two-stage scheduling strategy can improve the accuracy and economy of the IES scheduling results.

AB Evolutionary processes in hierarchical integrated energy systems (HIESs) generally lead to formations of coalitions which consolidate energy producers and energy consumers, typically driven by stakeholder benefits. However, the impacts of multiple coalitions on the operations of HIESs have seldom been analyzed in previous studies. In this study, a trading scheme was developed to analyze the operation of an HIES with the structure of one electricity utility company and one natural gas utility company in the upper level, multiple distributed energy stations (DESs) in the middle level, and multiple users in the lower level. The analytical expression of the optimal operation strategy of each market participant in each possible coalition, which was composed of DESs and users, was derived using the Lagrange's function. The results indicate that: (i) parameter changes in one coalition do not impact operations of other coalitions; (ii) DESs whose original customer tend to consume more electricity and heat with the same energy price would maintain their vested interests by remaining isolated; (iii) users hope to attract more DESs to decrease electricity price and heat price, however, DESs with high generation coefficients are unwelcome; and (iv) technological improvements of one DES will increase its own profits and decrease profits associated to other DESs in the same coalition.

AB Economic development and the comfort-loving nature of human beings in recent years have resulted in increased energy demand. Since energy resources are scarce and should be preserved for future generations, optimizing energy systems is ideal. Still, due to the complexity of integrated energy systems, such a feat is by no means easy. Here is where computer-aided decision-making can be very game-changing in determining the optimum point for supply and demand. The concept of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) was born in the twentieth century to enable computers to simulate humans' learning and decision-making capabilities. Since then, data mining and artificial intelligence have become increasingly essential areas in many different research fields. Naturally, the energy section is one area where artificial intelligence and machine learning can be very beneficial. This paper uses the VOSviewer software to investigate and review the usage of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the energy field and proposes promising yet neglected or unexplored areas in which these concepts can be used. To achieve this, the 2000 most recent papers in addition to the 2000 most cited ones in different energy-related keywords were studied and their relationship to AI-and ML-related keywords was visualized. The results revealed different research trends in recent years from the basic to more cutting-edge topics and revealed many promising areas that are yet to be explored. Results also showed that from the com-mercial aspect, patents submitted for artificial intelligence and machine learning in energy-related areas had a sharp increase.

AB With the rapid development in social informatization, more and more factors, such as regional economy, technological development, and people's living needs, will affect the supply-demand relationship of regional integrated energy systems (RIES), which involve multiple energy forms. These factors turn the supply-demand relationship of an energy system into a nonlinear and time-varying chaotic system. This makes it difficult to predict and balance these relationships, which poses a huge challenge to the prediction, planning, operation, etc. Existing conventional methods attempt to quantify the prediction bias caused by various external environmental factors of energy systems and to weaken the uncertainty caused by multiple energy loads through random programming. However, uncertainty factors increase with the development of an energy system, thereby inreasing the requirements of such uncertainty quantification methods. Furthermore, in conventional methods, the prediction or planning decisions are often made by an observer while neglecting the impact of the observer's decision-making behavior on prediction and planning. Therefore, this paper proposes a three-layer planning framework for to solve the above problems. This architecture includes quasi-quantum uncertainty periodic evaluation, stochastic planning based on information gap decision theory, and rolling planning based on model predictive control. First, we establish a quasi-quantum model of multi-energy system prediction error based on the quasi-quantum wave function model to qualitatively analyze prediction errors affected by uncertainty before and after planning. Simultaneously, combined with the evaluation model of the quasi-quantum potential energy function, a quasi-quantum uncertainty period evaluation model is proposed. Based on the minimum equivalent planning entropy, the planning cycle of multistage rolling planning is divided to minimize uncertainty. Second, the information gap decision theory is used to quantify the influence range of source and load uncertainty in the planning process and the multistage planning cycle is randomly planned. Then, the model predictive control method is used to control the actual error, and the planning strategy is changed in time to reduce the planning deviation caused by the prediction error. Finally, adopting a Beichen demonstration area in Tianjin, China, as a case study, the effectiveness of the proposed method in uncertainty analysis and long-term planning improvement is verified. The three-layer planning framework can improve the adaptability of the regional integrated energy system in the long-term planning process, and can timely adjust the planning scheme to cope with the impact of unpredictable uncertainties in the planning process.

AB Research focus (problem description, short background): The energy efficiency of a district heating (DH) system can be improved by fine-tuning supply and return temperatures and flow rates without need for invasive renovation of the end user heating systems.
   Research methods: We employ a correlation coefficient to examine the relationship between the local supply temperature and the use of heat; research relies on data hourly heat generation records from each heat generation facility in the DH system of Omsk, Russia, 2016-2017.
   Key research results/findings: The correlation declines the further we go from winter. Firstly, the relationship between the transition states and the outside temperature results from the relationship between external conditionings and heat parameters in DH. Secondly, both the energy consumption and the supply temperature are affected by the infrastructure, other weather conditions, and energy price; they are also highly dependent on consumer behavior, which is arbitrary, heterogeneous, and interdependent. Thirdly, the regional heating load is influenced by the characteristics of a building cluster. Although nearly all DH plants have a control system in place, we find that human factor jeopardizes the performance of such systems.
   Main conclusions and recommendations: To generalize these results to other systems, we emphasize that the effective diffusion coefficients and effective heat-loss coefficients are influenced by the thermal dynamics in the network and change on typical time scale (one year), hence their uncertainty. This study has produced a technique for visualizing the relationship that exists in a DH system between supply temperature and heat consumption; this technique is expected to contribute to the dynamic modeling, control, and planning of future integrated energy systems. The load profiles are dynamic; a thermal storage could be used to shift the timing of heating loads to minimize the flow through DH networks. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nuclear-renewable integrated energy systems (IES) consist of a variety of energy generation and conversion technologies and can be used to meet heterogeneous end uses (e.g., electricity, heat, and cooling demands). In addition to supply-demand balance, end-use heat demands usually require heat supply of certain temperature ranges. The effective and efficient utilization of heat produced within an IES is, therefore, a critical challenge. This paper examines design options of an IES that includes heating processes of multiple temperature grades. We investigate a cascaded design configuration, where the remaining residual heat after high-grade heating processes [e.g., hydrogen production through high-temperature steam electrolysis (HTSE)] is recovered to meet the low-grade heating needs [e.g., district heating (DH)]. Additionally, a thermal energy storage system is integrated into the DH system to address the imbalance between heat supply and demand. This paper primarily focuses on the design and modeling of the proposed system and evaluates its operation with a 24-h transient process simulation using a DH demand profile with hourly resolution. The results indicate that the residual heat from the HTSE exhaust is insufficient for the DH demand, and additional topping heat directly from the reactor process steam is needed. Furthermore, the inclusion of thermal energy storage within the DH system provides the necessary balance between thermal generation and demand, thereby ensuring a consistent rated temperature of the DH supply water. This approach helps minimize the control actions needed on the reactor side.

AB Integrated energy systems are one of the potential options for buildings that can reduce emission. In this research study, the energetic and economic performance of a micro-gas turbine combined heating and cooling plant coupled with a solar PV is analyzed for an office building in Iran. For each analysis, two different scenarios have been performed. System sizing parameters defined in a way that renewable to fossil fuel share is correlated to plant performance and economy. To model the studied system, a time-dependent method is used, which is the inherent characteristic of renewable energies. The renewable energies used here are solar heaters and solar panels. Contours of Net Present Value (NPV) are evaluated as a function of solar heating share and different economic parameters. In addition, optimal system sizing for a typical building is obtained and the results are provided. Effect of various major parameters shows that under the current condition and despite the supportive incentive for renewable energies, strategies and plans even without solar energy are not economically viable due to the high discount rates. In addition, results provide that, in reasonable and normal discount rate, fuel and grid electricity prices, governmental subsidization for conventional combined heat, and power (CHP) and combined cooling, heat, and power(CCHP) is not necessary, and only in this condition solar electricity selling price (i.e. governmental support program) is effective to increase renewable penetration. The results show that if the interest rate is less than 5%, the NPV becomes positive. Also, when the electricity price reaches $0.07/kWh or higher, the NPV becomes positive.

AB The energy crisis poses a significant challenge to modern society, exacerbated by the increasing deployment of renewable energy sources (RES) like wind turbines (WT), photovoltaics (PV), and combined cooling, heat, and power (CCHP) systems. Also, the optimal operation of integrated energy systems (IES) in the presence of energy storage systems (ESS) is imperative. This study proposes optimized energy dispatching for IES incorporating CCHP and RES, i.e., WT and PV, alongside ESS, including electrical energy storage (EES), thermal energy storage (TES), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). As natural gas is the primary fuel for CHP units, proper modeling of the natural gas network is necessary, considering its constraints for optimal gas flow. This paper uses the gas shift factor (GSF) matrix in a linear equation to obtain efficient gas flow in pipelines. This linear equation utilizing the GSF matrix facilitates efficient gas flow computation, reducing computational complexity. The study illustrates the economic benefits of modeling the natural gas network in cost reduction. Additionally, it investigates the impact of ESS on energy management within the IES, demonstrating how EES and TES enhance flexibility in meeting electric, heating, and cooling demands, particularly during peak hours, thus reducing operational costs. PHEVs further contribute to electric load supply when not used for daily trips. The objective function minimizes the total operating costs of the proposed IES, which is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model implemented in the general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) and solved using the CPLEX solver. Simulation results substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed IES in achieving optimal system performance, highlighting its potential in addressing contemporary energy challenges. The simulation results indicate that by modeling the natural gas network and incorporating TES, the total operating cost decreases from $384,098 to $378,430.

AB Urban multi-energy systems (UMESs) are integrated energy systems (IESs) which can alleviate the current energy crisis, improve energy utilization and realize multi-energy complementarity of modern. Various subsystems involved in the coupling of UMESs, including power grids, gas pipeline networks, cold/heat networks, transportation networks, and energy cyber-physical system, exhibit coupling characteristics such as multi-energy source modeling, complex uncertainty factor modeling, mutual influence of information and physical coupling. At present, the modeling and reliability assessments of UMESs are the most urgent tasks. In this paper, the latest research results on the reliability modeling and evaluation of UMESs are analyzed by considering their coupling components. In addition, the reliability modeling methods and the evaluation indexes of UMESs, including power-gas systems, power-thermal systems, power-traffic systems, and energy cyber-physical systems, are presented in this paper, with specific UMES modeling methods divided into model-driven modeling and data-driven modeling. Finally, future challenges for the reliability modeling and evaluation of UMESs are proposed, such as the dispatch strategy of the coupling components needs to be developed and continuously optimized to improve the reliability of UMESs, and the resilience of UMESs under the extreme scenarios needs to be further studied.

AB Integrated energy systems are getting high attention due to their synergistic effects on both the energy efficiency and process economy. This study demonstrates the similar effect of coupling four processes such as solid oxide electrolyzer cell (SOEC)-based hydrogen production from renewable energy, synthetic natural gas (SNG) pro-duction, steam Rankine cycle (SRC) for energy recovery, and amine-based SNG upgrading. Integration of two SRCs with SNG produces 1.8 MW of power that is assumed to reduce the load on SOEC. In addition, monoethanol amine (MEA)-based chemical absorption provides two benefits comprising SNG upgrading and capture of unreacted CO2. The proposed process integration claims the net zero output of CO2 in purified SNG stream as the captured CO2 is recycled back to the SNG reaction system for process enhancement. Conclusively, proposed integrated process synergistically enhances the SNG production efficiency by up to 86 % while the whole in-tegrated process efficiency is calculated at 77.3 %. Corresponding to process economy, unit production price of SNG is observed to be 0.223 $/kWh, which is comparable to other existing processes. Moreover, methane parity analysis and future predictions are made with expected natural gas price to estimate the possible reliance on SNG in coming decades.

AB In recent decades, the operational impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) strategies is massively dominating the scientific arena of improving the operation of energy systems and their hybrid integrations. Comprehensively, this paper highlights the firm methodological link of AI strategies with the different defined categories of numerical methods in hypothetically simulating the complex integrated energy systems especially the integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES). The conducted studies in this paper are related to the bifurcations of the applied numerical simulation methodologies for efficient energy systems and the practical implementations of the optimal operated energy systems considering the integration scenarios of these methodologies with AI strategies. Furthermore, this research reviews innovatively several case studies and practical examples to emphasize the effective contributions of AI strategies in enhancing the computational analysis of numerical simulation methods forming a smart approach for assessing experimental studies that are associated with energy systems. Finally, this paper deeply discusses the concept of integration either in the hybrid controlling strategies combining AI with numerical simulation methods or in combining different energy systems in one hybrid model for reliable operation considering the complexity level.

AB Combined heat and power dynamic economic dispatch (CHPDED) is one of the key technologies for the efficient operation of natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants in integrated energy systems. In this study, based on the actual operational characteristics of NGCC plants at combined heat and power mode, a plant advanced loads variation capacity model is developed. The advanced loads variation capacity models of NGCC plants are integrated into the CHPDED model to guarantee the feasibility of the dis-patched demands. Moreover, a field operational data based simplification method for the advanced loads variation capacity model is proposed to alleviate the computational burden. The field operational data of an actual NGCC station is taken to perform case studies. The calculation cases show that all the dis-patched demands calculated from the CHPDED model with advanced loads variation capacity models are feasible. Furthermore, the influence of the heat load variation process on the power load adjustment process is employed to achieve better dispatch results. Compared with CHPDED models in the existing research, the CHPDED model with advanced loads variation capacity models significantly improves the feasibility of the dispatched demands, thereby enhancing the real application value of CHPDED in the field operation of NGCC plants.

AB The integration of different energy sources to cover with the maximum efficiency the building energy demand is one of the principles for achieving the target of the nearly net Zero Energy Buildings (nNZEBs), as defined by the EPBD recast (2010/31/EU). Following this principle, there has been a shift from a conventional mono-carrier/mono-converter based logic (one energy source is used in one energy converter to meet each load) to a multi-carrier/multi-converter logic (a mix of energy sources feeds two or more energy converters to cover the energy loads).
   This paper reviews the technology, performance and the parameters of the latest multi-energy systems for residential ZEB on the market. The scope of the work is to provide the necessary information in order to design and operate integrated HVAC and domestic hot water (DHW) production systems. After characterising the building energy demand (forms of energy, thermal levels, peak loads and so on), the review focuses on integrated energy systems providing: heating energy for space heating and DHW production; heating and cooling energy for air conditioning and DHW production; heating energy for space heating, DHW production and electricity; heating and cooling energy for air conditioning, DHW production and mechanical ventilation. A schematic of each technology and a table contrasting the strengths, advantages, weaknesses and drawbacks of the various technologies are also provided. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The field of Energy System Analysis (ESA) has experienced exponential growth in the number of publications in the last two decades. This paper presents a comprehensive bibliometric analysis on ESA by employing different statistical techniques to investigate the underlying science's structure, characteristics, and patterns. The focus of results is on quantitative indicators relating to the number and type of publication outputs, collaboration links between institutions, authors and countries, and dynamic trends within the field. The five and twelve most productive countries have 50% and 80% of ESA publications, respectively. The dominant institutions are even more concentrated within a small number of countries. A significant concentration of published papers within countries and institutions was also confirmed by analysing collaboration networks. These show dominant collaboration within the same university or at least the same country. There is also a strong link among the most successful journals, authors and institutions. Within the field, the Energy journal has had the most publications, its editor-in-chief is the author with both the highest overall number of publications and the most highly cited publications. In terms of the dynamics within the field in the past decade, recent years have seen a higher impact of topics related to flexibility and hybrid/integrated energy systems alongside a decline in individual technologies. This paper provides a holistic overview of two decades' research output and enables interested readers to obtain a comprehensive overview of the key trends in this active field.

AB Integrated electricity and gas systems (IEGS) with power-to-gas (PtG) units, as novel sector coupling components between electricity and gas systems, have been considered a promising solution for the reliable and economic operation of the integrated energy systems which can effectively reduce the challenges associated with the high penetration of renewable energy sources (RES). To confirm the economic viability and technical feasibility of the IEGS, its coordinated planning will play a crucial role. The more comprehensive the modeling and evaluation of IEGS planning studies are, the more precise and practical the results obtained will be. In this paper, an in-depth and up-to-date assessment of the available literature on the IEGS planning is presented by addressing critical concerns and challenges, which need further studies. A vast variety of related topics in the IEGS planning, including the impact of costs, constraints, uncertainties, contingencies, reliability, sector coupling components, etc., are also reviewed and discussed. In addition, the role of PtGs and their impacts on the coordinated IEGS planning are reviewed in detail due to their crucial role in increasing the penetration of RES in future energy systems as well as limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The literature review completed by this paper can support planners and policymakers to better realize the bottlenecks in the IEGS development, so that they can concentrate on the remaining unsolved topics as well as the improvement of existing designs and procedures.

AB This study investigates the integration of an innovative combined power and cooling (CPC) system into the existing infrastructure of the DORA 1 geothermal power plant in Ayd & imath;n, Turkey. Using real operational data, this research models the integration of an ejector refrigeration cycle to enhance both power generation and cooling capabilities. The proposed system utilizes waste heat from the geothermal power plant's re-injection wells, which operate at temperatures of 81.7 degrees C and 69.1 degrees C. Four environmentally friendly refrigerants (R290, R717, R600 and R1234ze) were evaluated for their performance in the refrigeration cycle. Of these, R717 and R1234ze showed superior performance, achieving the highest coefficients of performance (COPs) and exergy efficiencies. The integration of the ejector refrigeration cycle resulted in a 12 % improvement in overall energy efficiency compared to traditional power-only systems, with a maximum COP of 0.72 under optimal conditions. This study fills a significant research gap by providing a practical application of combined geothermal power and refrigeration, and provides valuable insights into the feasibility, efficiency and sustainability of such systems. The results suggest that the proposed system not only improves energy utilization, but also contributes to environmental sustainability by reducing reliance on conventional cooling methods. This research has the potential to guide future developments in the field of geothermal energy and refrigeration, promoting the adoption of integrated energy systems for improved efficiency and reduced environmental impact.

AB The use of integrated bioenergy systems (IBS) is a prospective solution to address the emergent global demand for clean energy. The sustainability of IBS compared to stand-alone biomass processing facilities is achieved through integration of process units or component plants via their bioenergy products, by-products, wastes, and common utilities. However, such increased component interdependency makes the resulting integrated energy system vulnerable to capacity disruptions. IBS in particular are vulnerable to climate change-induced events (e.g., drought) that reduce the availability of biomass feedstocks in bioenergy production. Cascading failure due to such supply-side disruptive event is an inherent risk in IBS and may pose a barrier to the commercial-scale adoption of such systems. A previous study developed a risk-based criticality index to quantify the effect of a component's disruption within integrated energy systems. This index is used to rank the component's relative risk in the network based on the ripple effects of its disruption. In this work, a novel P-graph approach is proposed as an alternative methodology for criticality analysis of component units or plants in an IBS. This risk-based metric can be used for developing risk management polices to protect critical facilities, thereby increasing the robustness of IBS against disruptions. Two case studies on determining the criticality index of process units in an integrated biorefinery and component plants in a bioenergy park are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.

AB Integrated energy systems (IES) for combined power, heat and refrigeration supply achieved a wide application due to high flexibility in matching current loading. So as electricity is easily convertible into any other form of energy, gas engines are widely applied as driving engines characterized by high electrical and overall efficiency of about 45% and 90%, respectively. However, the highest thermal efficiency is achieved at full matching heat generated by the engine and heat transformed. This is often impossible in actual practice, especially if the heat is transformed into refrigeration by the most efficient and widespread absorption lithium-bromide chillers (ACh) and the heat not consumed by the ACh is removed from the atmosphere through an emergency radiator. The unused heat might be transformed by an ejector chiller (ECh) as the simplest and cheapest. So as the thermodynamic efficiency of any combustion engine is influenced essentially by the sucked air temperature, the excessive refrigeration produced by the ECh, is used for IES cooling to generate additional electricity and increase the electrical and overall efficiency of the engine. Such a redistribution of heat enables the enhancement of the efficiency of IES with an absorption-ejector chiller (AECh). The modified criteria for the comparative estimation of thermodynamic efficiency of innovative IESs with AEChs without overgenerated heat lost against a typical IES with an ACh and heat lost are proposed. In contrast to well-known electrical and heat efficiency, it considers the magnitude of heat loss and enables us to compare the heat efficiency of any version of transforming heat to refrigeration with an ideal basic version of IES based on a highly efficient ACh, transforming all the heat removed from the engine without heat loss. Some alternative scheme decisions for heat recovery systems have been developed based on monitoring data. They might be easily implemented into a typical IES with ACh.

AB Energy systems and their related technologies are susceptible to natural extreme events, categorized as high-impact low-probability (HILP) events, posing a significant threat to their reliable functioning. Gas-to-power (G2P) and power-to-gas (P2G) technologies establish a bidirectional interface between these energy systems, leading to the creation of integrated power and natural gas systems (IPGS) as energy systems. Due to their extensive geographical coverage, energy systems are particularly vulnerable to severe damage from natural calamities. Given the growing interest and research focus on energy systems resilience, this comprehensive review meticulously navigates the intricate terrain of resilience differentiation, offering a detailed roadmap fortified by insights from significant instances of grid failures and weather-driven contingencies. The review examines preemptive cyber security fortifications and strategic planning imperatives, scrutinizing each aspect with conviction and clarity. Temporally stratified into long-term and short-term horizons, it not only delineates prevailing approaches and methodologies but also identifies emerging trends poised to shape the future landscape of resilience enhancement. This paper provides an exhaustive review of existing research on the resilience of energy systems, introducing a visual framework for comparing different studies and facilitating easy understanding through multiple figures. Since uncertainties play a crucial role in decision-making within this field, this paper broadly explores methods for addressing them as presented in previous studies. Furthermore, the literature is meticulously classified to offer a clear and organized overview, highlighting the impact of HILP events, such as natural disasters and cyber-attacks, on energy systems resilience. This review underscores the critical need to fortify energy systems, emphasizing its importance as a crucial component of integrated energy systems in preparing for the continuous impact of natural disasters in future research.

AB To meet the growing demand for energy in societies and cities, solar-driven integrated energy systems equipped with electricity storage technology can be promising, which can lead to sustainable development and overcome environmental challenges. The purpose of this paper is to introduce and evaluate a new energy generation and storage configuration that solar energy plays a key role in the production of energy and hydrogen fuel. In the energy generation section, the solar farm based on the parabolic trough solar collector (PTSC) convert sun's light energy into thermal energy. The useful heat is then transferred to the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) sub-cycle. There, electric current is generated during a Rankine vapor process. A fraction of the electrical energy obtained during this process is feed into an alkaline electrolyzer (AEL) to produce hydrogen fuel. In addition, the products of the water decomposition process are feed into a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack to generate heat and power. Also, a thermoelectric generator (TEG) is connected to the stack's exhaust so that it can generate additional electric current. The electric current obtained by the electricity production section is stored for later uses through the pumped hydro and compressed air (PHCA) cycle. The results indicated that the energy configuration can generate approximately 208.5 kWh/day of electrical energy. In addition, the electrolyzer can produce approximately 1.1 kg/day of hydrogen fuel from the water electrolysis process. Moreover, a volume of 96 m(3) is required for PHCA in order to store available energy. Based on the calculated number of PTSCs, three scenarios are suggested to configuration of the solar farm.

AB Between 20% and 50% of world energy consumption is lost as waste heat through energy conversion and transportation in manufacturing processes. Within industrial clusters and Locally Integrated Energy Systems (LIES), waste heat recovery for the purpose of heating and power generation has been well established via schemes such as process streams Heat Integration, cogeneration system, district heating integration, boiler feed water preheating and Organic Rankine Cycle. Waste heat can also be used to generate cooling energy via technologies such as the absorption chiller. During the summer season and in tropical countries, space cooling in buildings typically consumes up to 50% of the total energy consumption. Further recovery of waste heat to generate cooling can result in huge energy savings and emission reduction. This paper presents a new Total Site Energy Integration concept that integrates not only heat and power, but also cooling. The waste heat technology considered for cooling generation are Absorption Chiller (AC) and Electric Compression Chiller (EC). As there is actually an economic trade-off between amounts of chilled water generated, cooling water and power consumed, the new framework has been proposed to guide users in selecting the most economical waste heat-to-cooling technology for Industrial Clusters and LIES. For the presented case study, the lowest-cost solution used a waste-heat driven AC supplying 4.0 MW of Chilled Water (ChW) and a supplementary EC supplying the remaining 1.0 MW. The electricity demand of the integrated system is loaded by 1.3 MWe through this ChW generation system configuration, while the cooling tower load is increased by 3.3 MW. The ChW is expected to be generated at USD 115.10/kW y compared to USD 270.9/kW y for generating ChW by a conventional EC system without waste heat recovery. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sustainable energy has been defined as energy sources that are expected to be depleted in a time frame relevant to the human race [1]. Many investigations have been carried out toward 100% renewable and sustainable energy [2-5]. Mathiesen et al. [6] have studied an integrated transport and renewable energy systems, they concluded that a 100 per cent renewable energy transport development for Denmark is possible without affecting the production of food if biofuels are combined with other technologies. These include savings and efficiency improvements, intermittent resources, electric trains and vehicles, hydrogen technologies and more. It is, however, connected to large challenges in the process towards this goal, requiring multiple measures and integrating transport with the remaining energy system. These challenges can only be met by combining planning for this long term goal, in the shorter term solutions. The 50 per cent energy system for 2030 is a shorter term proposal that enables the transport sector to reach the long term goal. The short-term 2030 energy system enables the later process towards 100 per cent renewable energy and has substantial economic benefits. Blarke and Lund [7] have studied the effectiveness of storage and relocation options in renewable energy systems, they described the future third generation integrated energy systems and how by increasing levels of flexibility will be reached by incorporating the demand for mobility, as well as the expansion of co-generation or tri-generation into quad-generation, for example by adding the facility to produce and store secondary fuels, such as hydrogen or ethanol, from primarily fuels, mainly electricity or waste. This editorial presents the latest developments in sustainable energy and environment. This issue will cover topics such as; Wind, solar, Wave, Bioenergy, Hydrogen and Fuel Cell, also different aspects on environment and energy which would lead to 100% sustainable energy.(C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper provides a systematic review of recent publications on simulation and analysis of integrated multi-vector energy networks (rather than energy hubs) and carries this out through the lens of energy trilemma. This review is essential for energy research community to move forward in effective manner toward 2050 net zero carbon targets. This paper presents a holistic view of state-of-the-art of research in this field and identifies gaps in knowledge which should be addressed by future research urgently. Furthermore, this paper introduces a taxonomy of energy networks analysis, offering a unified description of findings of relatively large number of publications devoted to the subject. Moreover, this work analyses and classifies current research trends in the field of analysis of energy networks integration, and also identifies future trends in this field. This review serves as a guide to researchers regarding the main findings of energy networks integration evaluated through the lens of energy trilemma. The reviewed papers have been classified into three groups: (i) Operational analysis; (ii) Optimal dispatch; and (iii) Optimal planning. The focus of the paper is energy networks, since they play fundamental role in integrated energy systems and there is a lack of understanding of interactions and interdependencies between multi-vector networks. Also, focus of this paper has been on key findings of published research rather than details of individual energy models. The paper provides useful insights for energy research community by presenting several novel ideas for future research and facilitating the path to a decarbonised economy, due to the fulfilled comprehensive systematic review.

AB An alkaline electrolyzer is a traditional equipment to generate hydrogen. Improving the yield of electrolyzers has recently captured much attention. In this regard, the utilization of carbon-coated nanomaterial structures is a state-of-art method. On the other hand, considering the current crisis of fossil energies, the exploitation of renewables and green technologies is necessary and unavoidable. Additionally, the design and development of integrated energy systems with two or more output products and the maximum usage of thermal losses to enhance productivity can increase the flexibility and acceptability of the energy system. In this regard, the current paper develops a framework for the performance of a new solar and biomass energies-driven multigeneration system (MGS). The main units installed in MGS are three electric energy generation units based on a gas turbine process, a solid oxide fuel cell unit (SOFCU) and an organic Rankine cycle unit (ORCU), a biomass energy conversion unit to useful thermal energy, a seawater conversion unit into useable freshwater, a unit for converting water and electricity into hydrogen energy and oxygen gas via a nanomaterial-based alkaline electrolyzer, a unit for converting solar energy into useful thermal energy (based on Fresnel collector), and a cooling load generation unit. The planned MGS has a novel structure and layout that has not been considered by researchers in previous papers. The current article is based on presenting a multi-aspect evaluation in order to investigate thermodynamic-conceptual, environmental and exergoeconomic an-alyzes. The outcomes indicated that the planned MGS can produce about 6.31 MW of electrical power and 0.49 MW of thermal power. Furthermore, MGS is able to produce various products such as potable water (-0.977 kg/s), cooling load (-0.16 MW), hydrogen energy (similar to 1.578 g/s) and sanitary water (similar to 0.957 kg/s). The overall energy and exergy pro-ductivities were measured as 78.13% and 47.72%, respectively. Also, the total investment and unit exergy costs were 47.16 USD per hour and 11.07 USD per GJ, respectively. Further, the content of carbon dioxide released from the planned system was equal to 10.59 kmol per MWh. A parametric study has been also developed to identify influencing parameters.

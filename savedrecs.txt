AB The energy transition hinges on the effective integration of renewable energy sources into the power grid. Islands can provide invaluable insights into the challenges and opportunities of integrating variable renewable energy into the grid due to their relatively small power systems, isolated grids, and diverse availability of renewable energy resources. This paper presents a study on the system benefits and challenges of marine energy integration in insular power systems, focusing on the Orkney Islands as a case study. A microgrid modeling approach that optimizes the mix of renewable sources and energy storage systems for future scenarios considering strategic time horizons (2030, 2040, and 2050) was employed. Results suggest that integrating ocean energies, namely, wave and tidal energy, yields notable benefits compared to traditional renewable energy sources exclusively. These benefits encompass reduced installed capacity, minimized energy storage requirements, lower excess generation, and overall cost-saving.

AB A potential and limitless source of renewable energy is the ocean. Yet, the intermittent and irregular characteristic of wave energy is a cause of concern for the stability of the power system. Thus, wave energy must be anticipated in order to be integrated into power systems. For harnessing energy from ocean waves, ocean wave height is a crucial parameter and due to this accurate and trustworthy forecasts of ocean wave height have gained increased attention recently. This makes it crucial to come up with a forecasting algorithm that is trustworthy, precise and can be used in varied situations. Therefore, in the proposed framework, well known data decomposition algorithm i.e. Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) is combined with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiDLSTM) deep learning algorithm to accurately forecast ocean significant wave height and ocean wave energy from the standard datasets acquired from National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) data site. Empirical outcomes produced using the proposed CEEMDANBiDLSTM method is found to be highly accurate as compared to the recently established forecasting algorithms in literature.

ID GLOBAL WATER CYCLE; SEA-LEVEL; OCEAN
AB Coupled climate models are prone to "drift" (long-term unforced trends in state variables) due to incomplete spinup and nonclosure of the global mass and energy budgets. Here we assess model drift and the associated conservation of energy, mass, and salt in CMIP6 and CMIP5 models. For most models, drift in globally integrated ocean mass and heat content represents a small but nonnegligible fraction of recent historical trends, while drift in atmospheric water vapor is negligible. Model drift tends to be much larger in time-integrated ocean heat and freshwater flux, net top-of-the-atmosphere radiation (netTOA) and moisture flux into the atmosphere (evaporation minus precipitation), indicating a substantial leakage of mass and energy in the simulated climate system. Most models are able to achieve approximate energy budget closure after drift is removed, but ocean mass budget closure eludes a number of models even after dedrifting and none achieve closure of the atmospheric moisture budget. The magnitude of the drift in the CMIP6 ensemble represents an improvement over CMIP5 in some cases (salinity and time-integrated netTOA) but is worse (time-integrated ocean freshwater and atmospheric moisture fluxes) or little changed (ocean heat content, ocean mass, and time-integrated ocean heat flux) for others, while closure of the ocean mass and energy budgets after drift removal has improved.

AB In this paper, a 1 kW-class Solar -Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion integrated Air-Conditioning (S-OTEC/AC) experimental system, which can provide both electrical energy and cooling energy without any pollution, is constructed for the first time. Based on the experimental data, the system ' s overall performance was comprehensively evaluated in terms of energy, exergy, economy, and environment (4 E). Furthermore, the performance difference between the system using solar energy (i.e., S-OTEC/AC) and the system without solar energy (i.e., OTEC/AC) was compared. The experimental results revealed that the maximum thermal efficiency of the SOTEC/AC system could reach 2.10%, which was 1.91 times higher than the OTEC/AC system. For the OTEC/AC and S-OTEC/AC systems, the maximum cold energy utilization efficiency was 4.12% and 10.09%, and the maximum isentropic efficiency was 18.81% and 76.84%, respectively. The minimum payback period for the SOTEC/AC system was 13.90 years, which was much lower than the 18.40 years of the OTEC/AC system. Additionally, the maximum primary energy saving achieved by the OTEC/AC system was 0.53 kW, while the SOTEC/AC system reached a higher value of 1.56 kW. From the results, the superiority of the S-OTEC/AC system over the OTEC/AC system was confirmed. This work not only provides data references for the actual operating characteristics of the S -OTEC integrated system, but also provides a new technical way for comprehensive utilization of ocean temperature difference energy.

AB Ocean wave energy is a developing industry that provides many attractive qualities for utilities to meet future energy demand. Therefore, it is important to investigate and understand the impact that ocean wave energy has on power system reliability. Reliability assessment techniques have been applied to systems with variable amounts of wind penetration, but as of yet, no study has explored the impacts that ocean wave energy may have on the reliability of power grids. The authors' approach to this problem applies a sequential Monte Carlo technique coupled with a Well-Being analysis approach to capture the seasonal variations associated with the ocean and then calculate key loss-of-load indices. The authors benchmark this method on the IEEE Reliability Test System 1996 and integrate synthesised ocean wave energy farms throughout the system. Their results suggest that wave energy results in a small decrease on the reliability of the power system, however, this change does not result in additional failure states as compared to the base system. Additionally, they are able to mitigate marginal system states with a relatively small increase in system capacity.

AB The present study deals with energy, exergy and environmental evaluation of an integrated ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) system include a flat plate solar collector, an organic Rankine cycle, an electrolyzer system boosted with a thermoelectric generator (TEG) unit. To precise assessment of suggested systems and determine the effects of adding thermoelectric generator to the system a comparative analysis is carried out. Two considered systems are solar ocean thermal energy conversion (S-OTEC) and solar ocean thermal energy conversion with thermoelectric (S-OTEC/TEG). A thermodynamic model is formed using Engineering Equation Solver (EES) to solve the set of linear equations governing on the component of the system. The result of exergy analyses shows that adding thermoelectric module to the S-OTEC results in exergy efficiency increment by 6.27%. Also adding thermoelectric unit to the system increase gross output power by 12.64 kW that the TEG pump input work in this case is 4.96 kW. Although the exergy destruction rate of the S-OTEC/TEG has a higher exergy destruction rate than S-OTEC, the exergy efficiency of S-OTEC/TEG is higher than S-OTEC. Environmental impact assessment criteria namely sustainability index (SI) and modified sustainability index (SI2), represent that applying TEG module to the system improves the SI2 while decreases the SI. Based on obtained results with methanol as working fluid, the SI change from 0.106 for S-OTEC to 0.183 for and S-OTEC/TEG system. In addition, the SI2 change from 1.949 to 2.220 when the TEG module added to the integrated system. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As government policies of energy resources shift towards the inclusion of renewable energy, the ocean resources have become great potential. One of the ocean energies is tidal current energy which can be used to drive underwater turbine and generator. A study on harvesting ocean is done in this integrated project with six subprojects which are investigated by the researchers of cross-disciplinary including mechanical, electrical, ocean, environmental engineering, underwater technology and marine science. The horizontal-axis turbine is attached to a magnetic generator and is installed in a square nozzle and diffusor duct which is semi-submerged and floated. The floating capture system is mooring by steel chains and the anchoring system is concrete gravity blocks. The deployment of the first NSYSU energy capture system is made in 2013 at Penghu Island and the system was safety approved in storm wave condition since it was passed by Teinping Typhoon attacked. A maximum power take off (PTO) nearly equal to 5 kW is monitored which is the largest tidal current PTO in Taiwan and also is the first on site successful ocean deployment in Taiwan.

AB Constructing a ocean Internet of Things requires an essential ocean environment monitoring system. However, the widely distributed existing ocean monitoring sensors make it impractical to provide power and transmit monitored information through cables. Therefore, ocean environment monitoring systems particularly need a continuous power supply and wireless transmission capability for monitoring information. Consequently, a high-strength, environmentally multi-compatible, floatable metamaterial energy harvesting device has been designed through integrated dynamic matching optimization of materials, structures, and signal transmission. The self-powered monitoring system breaks through the limitations of cables and batteries in the ultra-low-frequency wave environment (1 to 2 Hz), enabling real-time monitoring of various ocean parameters and wirelessly transmitting the data to the cloud for post-processing. Compared with solar and wind energy in the ocean environment, the energy harvesting device based on the defective state characteristics of metamaterials achieves a high-energy density (99 W/m3). For the first time, a stable power supply for the monitoring system has been realized in various weather conditions (24 h).
   Point-defect metamaterials have the property of concentrating vibration energy at the defect location. We design an environmental monitoring node based on this property, which can efficiently convert wave kinetic energy into electrical energy for real-time monitoring of the ocean environment.

AB Energy supply challenges hinder the economic development of remote offshore islands, which traditionally rely on diesel generators, causing pollution, shortages, and high costs. Wind power and photovoltaics, promising renewable sources, offer solutions when integrated with technologies such as desalination, refrigeration, and power generation, tailored to local conditions. However, their fluctuating nature leads to system instability. Additionally, while freshwater and cooling energy are vital for island residents, traditional desalination is costly, and refrigeration systems often fail to meet comprehensive needs. The pursuit of low-cost desalination and effective low-temperature refrigeration is still needed. This research proposes an integral renewable energy system for islands, combining ocean thermal, wind, and solar energy, with ocean thermal energy conversion system as the stabilizer. By employing freeze desalination technology, the system achieves a joint supply of lowcost seawater desalination and low-temperature refrigeration. Additionally, the integration of freshwater, hydrogen storage, and fuel cell technology facilitates the storage and reconversion of surplus electricity, addressing temporal and spatial energy mismatches while lowering power consumption costs. This study employs multi-objective optimization to refine the configuration of the multi-energy complementary supply system, concentrating on thermodynamic and economic performance objectives. Findings show that for user electrical loads fluctuating between 2 MW and 4.5 MW, with theoretical design capacities of 2 MW for ocean thermal energy conversion system, 2.2 MW for photovoltaic, and 1.7 MW for wind turbines. Its exergy efficiency is 34.63 % with a levelized cost of power at 0.084$/kWh. Furthermore, the system can potentially reduce CO2 emissions by approximately 2.16 x 104 tons annually, demonstrating significant environmental benefits. This research offers a solution with enhanced stability and lower energy supply costs for offshore islands, contributing to the advancement of zero-carbon offshore integrated energy technologies.

AB Arctic communities are suffering from food and energy shortages and their high logistic costs. An innovative ocean and solar-based energy, food, fuel, and water production system is developed for Arctic communities, including Nunavut's polar hamlets. The ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) with ammonia trilateral Rankine cycle, concentrated solar plant (CSP), bifacial photovoltaic (BiPV), cascaded heat pump, multi-effect desalination and polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer and fuel cell systems are integrated with hydrogen production and utilization and two tanks thermal energy storage systems. A food production system that includes a fish farm, a greenhouse, and a food drying facility is integrated into the system. Water and hydrogen productions are carried out with multi-effect desalination and PEM electrolyzer systems, respectively. Two primary integrations are considered for polar daytime and polar nighttime. The overall system-and its subsystems and components are extensively analyzed through various methods and simulations using the software packages. Both energy and exergy approaches are used to carry out thermodynamic analyses. The transient (time-dependent) analyses are carried out in order to present more detailed analyses with various ambient and operational parameters. Moreover, commercially available solar plant components and actual meteorological data from different databases are taken into account in order to provide more insightful results. The overall energy and exergy efficiencies for the average ambient conditions are found to be 16.28% and 36.35%, respectively. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes a hybrid ocean energy system to form a virtual power plant (VPP) for participating in electricity markets in order to promote the renewable ocean energy utilization and accommodation. In the proposed system, solar thermal energy is integrated with the closed-cycle ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) to boost the temperature differences between the surface and deep seawater for efficiency and flexibility improvements, and the thermodynamic effects of seawater mass flow rates on the output of solar-boosted OTEC (SOTEC) are exploited for deploying SOTEC as a renewable dispatchable unit. An optimal tidal-storage operation model is also developed to make use of subsea pumped storage (SPS) with hydrostatic pressures at ocean depths for mitigating the intermittent tidal range energy in order to make the arbitrage in the electricity market. Furthermore, a two-stage coordinated scheduling strategy is presented to optimally control seawater mass flow rates of SOTEC and hydraulic reversible pump-turbines of SPS for enhancing the daily VPP profit. Comparative studies have been investigated to confirm the superiority of the developed methodology in various renewable ocean energy and electricity market price scenarios.

AB The global seasonal cycle of energy in Earth's climate system is quantified using observations and reanalyses. After removing long-term trends, net energy entering and exiting the climate system at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) should agree with the sum of energy entering and exiting the ocean, atmosphere, land, and ice over the course of an average year. Achieving such a balanced budget with observations has been challenging. Disagreements have been attributed previously to sparse observations in the high-latitude oceans. However, limiting the local vertical integration of new global ocean heat content estimates to the depth to which seasonal heat energy is stored, rather than integrating to 2000 m everywhere as done previously, allows closure of the global seasonal energy budget within statistical uncertainties. The seasonal cycle of energy storage is largest in the ocean, peaking in April because ocean area is largest in the Southern Hemisphere and the ocean's thermal inertia causes a lag with respect to the austral summer solstice. Seasonal cycles in energy storage in the atmosphere and land are smaller, but peak in July and September, respectively, because there is more land in the Northern Hemisphere, and the land has more thermal inertia than the atmosphere. Global seasonal energy storage by ice is small, so the atmosphere and land partially offset ocean energy storage in the global integral, with their sum matching time-integrated net global TOA energy fluxes over the seasonal cycle within uncertainties, and both peaking in April.

AB Turbulent energy cascade and intermittency are very important characteristics in the turbulent energy evolution process. However, understanding the temporal-spatial features of kinetic energy transfer and quantifying the correlations between different scales of turbulent energy remains an outstanding challenge. To deeply understand the spatial-temporal features in the energy transfer process, an integrated features identification and extraction method is proposed to quantitatively investigate the correlations using the ocean shear turbulence measured by an autonomous vertical reciprocating profiler (AVRP). The proposed integrated method mainly contains two parallel features analysis modules: first, temporal multiscale features structures of the nonlinear and nonstationary turbulent cascade are identified by Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD); then, the ocean microstructure shear fluctuation data are decomposed into a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), which are characterized by different time scales and frequency bandwidths. The local features of energy transfer are identified when the local intermittency peaks overlap and the phase-synchronization case occurs between two neighboring scales; second, the spatial statistical characteristics of the turbulent energy dissipation are quantitatively studied. The cumulative probability distribution functions (CPDFs) of kinetic energy dissipation are approximated well by a normal distribution, indicating that the turbulent dissipation process exhibits a robust spatial scaling correlation and a few intense dissipation locations dominate the integrated process. Finally, the proposed integrated method is evaluated through experiments using an autonomous vertical reciprocating profiler deployed in the South China Sea. Preliminary experimental results show that the proposed novel method is useful to improve our understanding of turbulent energy transfer and the evolution process in the ocean dynamic systems.

AB In this paper, we present the study of system dynamics of the floating kuroshio turbine (FKT) system which is designed to harness ocean current energy. We focus on the mooring line system design and its interaction with the FKT system. The effects of line diameter and two different auxiliary line systems were studied. Their responses in waves were also investigated. We integrated several commercial and in-house packages. The system buoyancy and weight and their centers were estimated using the Rhino software. The system hydrodynamic coefficients were obtained through WAMIT, system drag coefficient through FLUENT, turbine propulsive force through lifting surface code, and system dynamics through OrcaFlex. The results show that the mooring line system can create strong influence on the FKT system operations in the ocean current environments.

AB Wave energy converters (WECs) are built to extract wave energy. However, this kind of device is still expensive for commercial utilization. To cut down the cost of WECs by sharing the construction cost with breakwaters, an integrated cylindrical WEC-type breakwater system that includes a cylindrical WEC array in front of a very long breakwater is proposed to extract wave energy and attenuate incident waves. This paper aims to optimize the performance of the integrated cylindrical WEC-type breakwater system. A computational fluid dynamics tool, openfoam (R), and a potential flow theory-based solver, HAMS (R), are utilized. openfoam (R) provides viscosity corrections to a modified version of HAMS (R) in order to accurately and efficiently predict the integrated system's performance. Parametric studies are conducted to optimize the integrated system, and a novel setup with an extra arc structure is found to significantly improve the performance of the integrated system.

AB Effective strategies to gain hydrogen energy from harvesting and conversion from ocean energy attract extensive attention in the new energy source field. Remarkably, triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) presents potential applications for harvesting large-scale blue energy from the ocean. Herein, we propose a self-powered hydrogen generation system by multilayer beads integrated spherical TENG with the power management system (PMS). The triggered switch used in the spherical TENG overcomes the limitation of working frequency through instantaneous driving, significantly improving the output performance and greatly expanding its application range. The six-layer beads integrated TENG presents a significant improvement in converting water wave energy into electric energy, and its power density reaches 21.3 W m- 3 at 2 Hz. The integrated TENG charges 470 mu F capacitor to 5 V in 200 s, and the hydrogen production rate is about 64.5 mu L min-1 under the water wave condition, which overcomes the limitation of external power demands for conventional water electrolysis. Compared with the electrochemical cells driven by solar, our integrated system can operate in all weather conditions without an external power source. This work demonstrates the feasibility of the electrochemical conversion of low-frequency water wave energy into green energy.

AB The ocean contains a huge amount of renewable energy. There is a tremendous need to develop new ocean energy harvesting technology for long-term and self-sustained global ocean observation. Herein, an omnidirectional and high-efficient built-in wave energy harvesting (WEH) system fully integrated in ocean observing platform is introduced, realizing energy harvesting and self-powered ocean-wave sensing, simultaneously. Based on the chaotic pendulum design and high-efficient electromagnetic coupling effect, the high output power of 520 mW and power density of 0.66 mW/cm(3) have been achieved under ultra-low-frequency wave excitation with wave height of 20 cm and period of 1 s, which is extremely higher than most of the reported ones. More significantly, the built-in WEH system was fully integrated with the buoy and successfully completed the offshore test in the Yellow Sea for one month and open ocean test in the Kuroshio Extension (KE) region of Northwestern Pacific for four months. During the offshore test, the working time of an autonomous positioning sensor of the buoy was significant extended from 10 to 25 days, which is 2.5 times longer. During the open ocean test, the built-in WEH system was able to long-term survive in the Kuroshio Extension, which is one of the most dynamically-complex regions in the global ocean. The maximum and averaged output power of 210 and 24.5 mW, respectively, have been achieved, under the ocean wave heights and periods varying from 0.4 to 2.2 m and from 4.2 to 7.2 s. Meanwhile, the generated voltage data can be transmitted via Iridium Satellite and utilized for evaluating and sensing the real-time wave conditions, i.e., wave height and period. It comes to an encouraging conclusion that the built-in WEH system cannot only harvest sufficient energy to extend the service life of ocean observing platform, but also as a self-powered wave sensor to assist ocean monitoring. This work shows a promising milestone in WEH technology from laboratory prototype to practical open ocean application.

AB Considering the global urgency to decrease carbon emissions and shift to sustainable energy sources, combining solar and other renewables with hydrogen generation appears to offer an appealing answer. The combination of solar and ocean energies with hydrogen production, therefore, offers a great potential to improve energy efficiency and create a feasible route towards zero-emission energy systems. A new hybrid photoelectrochemical (PEC)-conventional electrolysis system was designed and incorporated into the proposed multigeneration system. The hybridized reactor combines the benefits of PEC and conventional electrolysis by using a developed bipolar anode to produce hydrogen continuously, even when there is no solar radiation. The main aim of this research is to investigate the integrated power process that utilizes solar power for several uses, such as generating electricity, producing freshwater, and synthesizing hydrogen. The proposed research involves integrating several components, including a solar through collector system, a combination of power cycles (steam and organic Rankine cycles), a multi-effect desalination (MED) unit, a new hybrid electrolyzer system, a wave energy system, and a hydrogen storage and refuelling station. The main outputs include 2.05 kg/s freshwater production, 0.125 kg/s hydrogen production, 16,284.24 kW net work rate, and 95,068 kW solar heat input. The highest exergy destruction rates were found in the solar collector (56,194.8 kW) and turbines T1 and T2 (6019.9 and 4627.6 kW). The overall energy and exergy efficiencies of the proposed system are obtained to be 15.83% and 16.61 %, respectively.

AB This paper proposes an integrated ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) system that couples power generation, refrigeration, and desalination. Based on the mathematical model, the thermodynamic, economic, and exergoeconomic performances are explored by evaluating several crucial parameters such as the ammonia -water concentration of the power subsystem (Xgen), the turbine inlet pressure (Pturb), etc. The results indicate that integrated OTEC system significantly improve the exergoeconomic performance since the efficient utilization of the exhausted cold seawater. The integrated system can achieve maximum net output power of 16.79 kW, refrigeration capacity of 268.87 kW, freshwater production of 53.22 t/d, as well as exergetic efficiency of 31.69% when the power subsystem's flow rate is 1.0 kg/s. Moreover, there is a maximum net output power when Pturb is under 800 kPa, and increasing Pturb leads to higher optimal Xgen. The maximum net output power, for instance, is 2.18 kW, 4.62 kW, and 9.79 kW when Pturb value is 600 kPa, 700 kPa, and 800 kPa, respectively, with corresponding optimal ammonia concentration values of 0.73, 0.83, 0.93. Furthermore, the maximum exergetic efficiency increases as Pturb enlarges. The maximum exergetic efficiency rises from 20.40% to 31.69% when Pturb increases from 600 kPa to 950 kPa. Besides, compared to the single OTEC plant's levelized cost of energy at 3.56 $/(kWh), the integrated system's can be as low as 0.098 $/(kWh).

AB Current advances in wave energy technologies have enabled the development of new integrated measurement platforms powered by the energy of wave motion. Instrumentation is now being deployed for the long-term observation of the coastal ocean, with the objectives of analyzing the performance of wave energy converters (WECs) and studying their interactions with the surrounding environment and marine life. In this work, we present the most relevant findings of the installation and initial operation of the Open Sea Lab (OSL), the first coastal observatory in Latin America powered entirely by a WEC device. We evaluated the preliminary data regarding the combined operation of the system, the generation of energy, and the observations obtained by the continuous monitoring of physical variables at the site. The data showed the seasonal variability of the energy produced by the WEC for a range of wave heights during the period of observation. We also investigated the rapid development of biofouling on mooring lines, junction boxes, and other parts of the system, which is characteristic of the settlement and growth of organisms in this ocean region. These analyses show how this new facility will advance our understanding of the coastal environment in the south Pacific Ocean and foster new interdisciplinary collaborations addressing environmental and technical challenges, thereby contributing to the development of wave energy on the continent.

AB The pressure to develop new and renewable forms of energy to combat climate change, ocean acidification, and energy security has encouraged exploration of sources of power generation from the ocean. One of the major challenges to deploying these devices is discerning the likely effects those devices and associated systems will have on the marine environment. Determining the effects each device design and deployment system may have on specific marine animals and habitats, estimating the extent of those effects upon the resiliency of the ecosystem, and designing appropriate mitigation measures to protect against degradation all pose substantial challenges. With little direct observational or experimental data available on the effects of wave, tidal, and offshore wind devices on marine animals, habitats, and ecosystem processes, researchers have developed the Environmental Risk Evaluation System (ERES) to provide preliminary assessments of these risks and to act as a framework for integrating future data on direct interactions of ocean energy devices with the environment. Using biophysical risk factors, interactions of marine animals and seabirds, with ocean energy devices and systems, are examined; potential effects on habitats, and changes in processes such as sedimentation patterns and water quality, are also considered. The risks associated with specific interactions for which data are more readily available are explored including interactions between ocean energy devices and surface vessels, toxicity of anti-biofouling paints, and potential for harm to animals from turbine blade strike. ERES also examines the effect that environmental regulations have on the deployment and operation of ocean energy devices.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) has extended its coverage to various spatial domains and has established interconnection to serve widespread applications of a larger spatial scale. Such IoT is called the space-air-ground-ocean-integrated network (SAGOI-Net), which consists of multiple battery-powered heterogeneous devices. Hence, energy efficiency is the key point of SAGOI-Net to be stably operated for a long time without manual maintenance. This article proposes a novel scheme of energy-efficient autonomous and decentralized SAGOI-Net establishment using an intelligent autonomous underwater glider (AUG) to serve marine applications. The proposed SAGOI-Net is energy efficient because the energy consumption is minimized by: 1) employing nonpropeller-driven AUG; 2) navigating AUG under water without acoustic sensor or extra energy-consuming vision sensors; and 3) equipping the self-navigation (SN) system based on lightweight neural network model to save the energy consumption of onboard computing resource. Moreover, assuming the AUG navigation problem as time-series regression, the proposed scheme designs SAGOI-Net to be autonomous and decentralized with the aid of lightweight long short-term memory (LSTM) network-based SN (SN-LSTM) system of AUG. The lightweight SN-LSTM model is trained end-to-end on dynamically modeled AUG motion information along with numerically modeled ocean environment data to quantitatively analyze the impact of the ocean environment on AUG. The simulation results demonstrate a superior performance of the AUG SN along with energy efficiency of the proposed SAGOI-Net.

AB Many wave energy converters have been developed in the past century with various power takeoff systems, including those devices with air turbines, linear electromagnetic motors, and hydroelectric components. Although these systems have their own advantages, power takeoffs are still recognized as the most important challenge in ocean wave energy technology. In this paper, a mechanical motion rectifier (MMR) based power takeoff system is proposed and prototyped for wave energy converter. This power takeoff system can convert the bidirectional wave motion into unidirectional rotation of generator by integrating two one-way bearings into a rack pinion system. A wave energy converter which contains a 1.2 m buoy and MMR based power takeoff system was designed and fabricated in this paper. The models of power takeoff system and single-body wave energy converter were built and analyzed. The simulation results in regular wave show that MMR based power takeoff can produce more power comparing with linear damping power takeoff system and the optimal PTO damping of MMR system is smaller than that of linear damping system. Lab testing of power takeoff mechanism and ocean testing of the overall ocean wave converter system were also conducted to validate the concept of MMR design. The disengagement and engagement of one-way bearings in the mechanical motion rectifier system were verified in both lab and ocean test.

AB The direction and frequency drift of ocean waves presents considerable challenges to existing platform technologies to utilize such energy. Here, we present a starfish-inspired magnetoelastic generator (MEG) array floating on the ocean surface, efficiently converting irregular ocean wave fluctuations into electricity for sustainable water splitting and hydrogen (H2) fuel production. Within the starfish-inspired MEG array system, each MEG unit that harnesses the magnetoelastic effect to efficiently convert local ocean wave energy into electricity with a voltage of 12.52 mV cm-2 and a current of 0.24 mA cm-2 at 2 Hz. By integrating eight such units onto the tube feet, the starfish-inspired system achieved a maximum peak voltage of 4.33 V, charged a capacitor to 2.42 V within 80 s and electrolyzed the water to continuously produce H2 at a rate of 1.18 mL min-1. The starfish-inspired MEG array is a milestone for ocean wave energy harvesting, promoting H2 economics and carbon neutrality.

AB In the field of isolated island energy supply, the OTEC system is considered promising due to its large storage capacity, and pollution-free characteristics. To improve energy efficiency, polygeneration systems have gradually become a research hotspot for their low cost and high return features. In this context, a novel Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion system integrated with an air conditioning unit (OTEC-AC) is introduced, demonstrating capabilities in electricity, cooling capacity, and fresh water production by experiments. The effects of various flow rates and temperatures of the heat and cold sources, along with the air-conditioning system water flow rate on the system performance is explored. Besides, the overall performance of the OTEC-AC is compared with four representative OTEC models. The results indicate that there is a threshold for the influence of cold and heat source flow rate on the performance of power generation system. The OTEC-AC system shows a highest net power of 132.6 W, cooling capacity of 2.14 kW, condensate production of 3.24 kg/h, and achieves a system exergy efficiency and CO2 reduction of 34.7 % and 5801 kg/year, respectively. The annual CO2 reduction per kilowatt of installed capacity of the system is increased by 135.6 %, compared with the conventional OTEC system.

AB Methane hydrates are potential valuable energy resources. However, finding an efficient method for methane gas recovery from hydrate sediments is still a challenge. New challenges arise from increasing environmental protection. This is due in part to the technical difficulties involved in the efficient dissociation of methane hydrates at high pressures. In this study, a new approach is proposed to produce valuable products of: 1. Net methane gas recovery from the methane hydrate sediment, and 2. Deep ocean power generation. We have taken the first steps toward utilization of a fuel cell system in methane gas recovery from deep ocean hydrate sediments. An integrated high pressure and high temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and steam methane reformer (SMR) system is analyzed for this application and the recoverable amount of methane from deep ocean sediments is measured. System analysis is accomplished for two major cases regarding system performance: 1. Energy for SMR is provided by the burning part of the methane gas dissociated from the hydrate sediment. 2. Energy for SMR is provided through heat exchange with fuel cell effluent gases. We found that the total production of methane gas is higher in the first case compared to the second case. The net power generated by the fuel cell system is estimated for all cases. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of integrated electrochemical devices to accomplish energy efficient dissociation of methane hydrate gases in deep ocean sediments. Concepts for use of electrochemical devices (e.g., high temperature fuel cells) for methane gas recovery from hydrates and efficient electricity production from the released gases are developed. The technical feasibility of these integrated systems for operation in hydrate reservoirs in deep ocean sediments was then evaluated using combined systems of thermodynamic and heat transfer equations, which are presented in detail.

AB Ocean currents impose a negative effect on Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) underwater target searches, which lengthens the search paths and consumes more energy and team effort. To solve this problem, an integrated algorithm is proposed to realise multi-AUV cooperative search in dynamic underwater environments with ocean currents. The proposed integrated algorithm combines the Biological Inspired Neurodynamics Model (BINM) and Velocity Synthesis (VS) method. Firstly, the BINM guides a team of AUVs to achieve target search in underwater environments; BINM search requires no specimen learning information and is thus easier to apply to practice, but the search path is longer because of the influence of ocean current. Next the VS algorithm offsets the effect of ocean current, and it is applied to optimise the search path for each AUV. Lastly, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed integrated approach, simulation results are given in this paper. It is proved that this integrated algorithm can plan shorter search paths and thus the energy consumption is lower compared with BINM.

AB Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) is a heat engine application that utilizes the Rankine cycle to extract energy from the thermal gradient between surface seawater and deep seawater. Hybrid cycle OTEC (H-OTEC) is a combination of an open cycle desalination system and a closed-cycle power generation system that leverages the features of both cycles. Unlike other desalination technologies that require extensive energy to operate, H-OTEC relies entirely on renewable energy. In addition, a desalination plant can be coupled with the H-OTEC system (H-OTEC + D) to improve its performance. Conventionally, the total heat transfer area of heat exchangers per net power is used as an objective function to achieve optimal performance with the lowest capital expenditure cost. The proposed objective function, unlike the conventional one, considers both power and water. In this study, the optimization of H-OTEC + D and H-OTEC is carried out by minimizing the proposed objective function, considering several independent variables. The performance of both systems is evaluated in terms of the objective function, power consumption, seawater flow rates, and desalination ratio. The findings also indicate the effectiveness of the proposed objective function over the conventional one as an effective tool for maximizing power and desalinated water generation.

AB The output power fluctuations from the wave energy converters (WECs) with a high peak-to-average ratio need to be smoothed out before supplying power to electric loads or power grids. Usually, short-term energy storage is used to smooth out the output power fluctuations of WECs. In this article, a novel multi-filter-based dynamic power-sharing control is devised for a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) integrated with a grid-connected WEC. An advanced model of HESS-integrated WEC consisting of a direct-drive permanent magnet linear generator, a supercapacitor, and a battery system is developed to test the proposed multi-filter-based dynamic control strategy under realistic conditions. The distinguishing features of this study are as follows; 1) the power-sharing strategy is based on a dynamic filter that is designed to change its corner frequency depending upon the incoming ocean wave, 2) the low and the high-frequency power components are allocated based on ocean wave conditions, 3) the proposed strategy is suitable for the real-time control of the proposed HESS integrated with the WEC, and 4) a detailed model of the WEC is used instead of using a pre-saved power profile. The results suggest that with the implementation of the proposed multi-filter-based dynamic power-sharing scheme in the HESS integrated WECs, the output power can be effectively smoothed out before supplying the power to the grid.

AB The present paper comprises of an integrated system in which industrial heating, space cooling, electrical power and fresh water are produced by multigeneration system using solar, geothermal and ocean thermal energy inputs. Fresh water is produced using a multi stage flash desalination (MSF), and the direct steam generator (DSG) is used to produce power from solar. The geothermal system, with double stage flashing, is incorporated to assist solar due to its intermittent nature. The ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) is interconnected with desalination system while producing 30.49 kW with 0.73% energy efficiency. The proposed system is analyzed energetically and exegetically, and it is found that the energy and exergy efficiencies of the overall system are 13.93% and 17.97% respectively.

AB Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) systems have been demonstrated to generate power with high density. However, the electrical output power obtained from wave energy harvesting using TENG systems is typically limited to several milliwatts. To address this limitation and support various ocean buoy systems, an efficient method to scale-up TENG systems is required. In this paper, we present a self-powered ocean buoy (SPOB) incorporating a disk-type, soft-contact, mechanical frequency regulator TENG (DSMFR-TENG). The mechanical frequency regulator (MFR) enables the conversion of low-frequency wave energy to high-speed mechanical rotation, facilitating high power generation with the disk-type TENG. The SPOB was tested in a wave tank, reaching a peak power output of 470 mW and an average power output of 130 mW after the MFR released the rotational energy. To further enhance the functionality of the buoy, the DSMFR-TENG and a microcontroller, temperature sensor, and acoustic transmitter were integrated with the SPOB. The acoustic transmitter successfully transmitted signals 7, 23, and 30 times over a one-minute period at wave frequencies of 0.33 Hz, 0.5 Hz, and 1 Hz, respectively, thereby demonstrating the power supply capability of the TENG system for ocean buoys.

AB The need for effective ocean monitoring in the marine environment presents a meaningful and challenging research direction to develop multi-directional, self-powered, and environmentally friendly sensors. This study presents a self-powered coral-inspired sensing (SPCS) system for real-time ocean wave monitoring. The SPCS integrates a triboelectric nanogenerator, a small electromagnetic generator (EMG)-based wave energy harvesting, and biomimetic structures to harvest mechanical energy from ocean waves, enabling autonomous operation without an external power source. The system demonstrates high sensitivity to wave height, frequency, and multi-directional sensing. Specifically, the SPCS accurately detects wave heights ranging from 25 mm to 125 mm, exhibiting a linear voltage increase with a correlation coefficient of 0.95. The EMG-based wave energy harvesting generates approximately 3 mW of power under typical wave conditions, sufficient to sustain the system's wireless transmission module. Thus, the SPCS offers a promising solution for long-term, remote wave monitoring in marine environments, offshore platforms, and oceanographic research.

AB Recently, renewable power plants utilize clean and sustainable resources for electricity generation. The Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) system uses ocean surface water as a high-temperature source and the water at a depth of the ocean as a low-temperature source. The difference between these temperatures is 20 degrees C or greater, and the working fluid with a low boiling point can be used for electricity generation. In a closed-cycle OTEC system, the working fluid through a thermodynamic cycle based on the Rankine cycle can rotate the turbine and generate electricity. Due to the ocean surface temperature variation, the output power of the OTEC system changes and yields numerous states concerning the generated power of this plant. Thus, for integrating the OTEC systems with the power system, many aspects of power system including reliability may be affected and thus, new approaches must be developed for investigation of these effects. In this paper, the reliability of the power system containing the OTEC system based on the multi-state reliability model and the conditional value at risk concept is evaluated and the valuable indices used for generation expansion planning of the power system are calculated.

AB Increasing the penetration of Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) in electric generation systems is a fundamental goal in reducing greenhouse gases emission. To reduce power fluctuations in electricity networks and avoid curtailment, large-scale energy storages represent one of the most promising solutions. Thermally-Integrated Pumped Thermal Energy Storage (TI-PTES) systems are an interesting technology that can be used for this scope if the heat source adopted for thermal integration can provide significant thermal power. The ocean temperature gradient in tropical areas is an attractive heat source to be coupled with the PTES system to realise efficient electric storage when integrated with an Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) system. In this study, a heat pump refrigerated by the warm tropical surface water uses electricity surplus from VRE to heat an amount of water contained in an end-life cargo ship used as water storage. The system discharges the stored energy through an ORC cycle refrigerated by the cold deep seawater when VRE production is low. A preliminary sensitivity analysis of the storage size and temperature is proposed through detailed system modelling to define the optimal design and layout. Therefore, the part-load analysis of the system is assessed to characterise the off-design performances and evaluate the potentialities of this system when applied to a plausible case study that includes VRE generation and an electric demand profile. Finally, the Levelised Cost Of Storage (LCOS) is evaluated and compared to other storage technologies. Results show that the round-trip efficiency may achieve values higher than 60 %, and an equivalent electric battery capacity of 20 MWh is feasible using end-life ships acting as energy storage. In contrast, the obtained LCOS of 388 euro/MWh is still not competitive in the energy market. However, since tropical areas have high energy prices, considering this application for remote island electrification could be an interesting solution.

AB Realising zero-emission harbour-to-harbour passenger and logistics ferries is critical for establishing sustainable transport systems. This zero-emission goal faces various challenges, including the high energy demands of ferries and the limited availability of low-carbon energy sources. To address these challenges, ocean energy systems, such as offshore wind turbines and floating photovoltaics, may offer a promising solution. These systems harness the power of the ocean to generate renewable energy and provide a reliable and sustainable energy source for medium-distance electric ferries. This study proposes a hybrid system to enhance energy interaction among electric ferries, renewable energy sources and the local grid. The system aims to enhance the utilisation of renewable energy and evaluate the integrated technical, economic and environmental performance of the hybrid system. The simulations are conducted via Trnsys. A non-dominant case in Scenario D, equipping submarine cables, shows a high on-site renewable energy weighting matching index of approximately 0.7, achieving a positive relative net present value of approximately 64.9 million HKD. The study provides a comprehensive assessment of the hybrid system and a sensitivity analysis of the key economic performance factors. The results of this study can inform policy decisions regarding the development of renewable energy and transport systems. Moreover, the proposed hybrid system shows high potential to address the challenges of sustainable ferry transportation by utilising ocean renewable energy sources, thereby reducing emissions and promoting environmental sustainability in harbour cities.

AB Although various triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) and hybrid ocean kinetic energy harvesters (OKEHs) have been devised for blue energy harvesting, the lack of studies in the real ocean has hindered their progress. Here, a high-sensitivity modular shuttle-like hybrid nanogenerator (MSHG) is prepared, comprising contactseparation TENG, piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG), and electromagnetic generator (EMG) components. Its acceleration feature and electrical performance were systematically investigated under various conditions, from laboratory setups to real ocean waves. The MSHG responds sensitively to low-level excitations and exhibits robust energy harvesting capability in the ocean. Statistical analysis shows that its most probable output frequency reaches 0.83 Hz, which is about four times higher than the main frequency of the ocean wave (0.1 -0.2 Hz). A 12-integrated MSHG system effectively harvests ocean wave energy to power a water-quality detector, while its most probable acceleration amplitude is approximately 24% of the maximum in a simulated linear motor motion and 57% of the mean value under simulated water wave. The findings provide valuable insights for advancing nanogenerator applications in real oceans.

AB Blue energy represents a crucial renewable energy resource; however, its development has been limited by the low and variable frequency characteristics of sea waves. In this study, we present a novel approach, wherein a spring pendulum coupled hybrid energy harvester (SPC-HEH) is employed to address these limitations. The SPCHEH integrates two electromagnetic generators (EMGs), two piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs), and two multilayer-structured triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) into a vessel, enabling efficient wave energy harvesting. Notably, the integration of the lightweight PENG and TENG with the heavy EMG not only enhances the water wave energy harvesting capability of SPC-HEH but also optimizes its spatial utilization efficiency. Additionally, owing to the spring pendulum, the SPC-HEH is capable of simultaneously harnessing the wave kinetic energy of horizontal and vertical directions and realize the decoupling of vertical energy capture from horizontal energy capture. Remarkably, owing to its precise geometric design and efficient space utilization, the SPC-HEH achieves an impressive peak power density of 82.4 Wm(-3). Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of the SPC-HEH by integrating it with a circuit as a self-powered ocean buoy for real-time monitoring of ocean temperature, wave frequency, ocean turbidity and other information. The remarkable potential of this system for integration into self-powered smart ocean IoT networks holds significant promise for advancing marine research and environmental monitoring capabilities.

AB Marine aquaculture has been expanded into more remote areas due to the increasing demand for high value-added fish products, bringing more challenges in fuel supply and mooring safety to open ocean aquaculture farms. Therefore, the idea of integrating aquaculture farms with offshore renewable energy has attracted tremendous interest. This study proposes a novel open ocean aquaculture ship integrated with a NREL 5 MW wind turbine. In addition, an internal turret mooring system is installed at the bow of the aquaculture ship, making the wind turbine always face the wind blowing direction due to the weathervaning effect. In this study, a preliminary study of the dynamics and wind power generation of the proposed open ocean aquaculture ship was conducted. The aerodynamic and elastic effects of the wind turbine and the effect of nets under the wave and current behavior on the dynamics of the single-point moored aquaculture ship were investigated. Furthermore, the effects of the dynamics of the aquaculture ship on the power generation of the wind turbine were also studied to investigate the feasibility of the idea to integrate an aquaculture ship with a wind turbine.

AB Extracting energy from waves offers a promising solution for ocean robots to address energy limitations and extend operational time. However, the compact size of ocean robots and the random nature of waves impose significant design challenges for wave energy converters. In response to these problems, this paper proposes an ocean robot that adopts a dual-mode operation principle and integrates an umbrella-shaped wave energy converter (U-WEC). In U-WEC mode, the robot deploys four foldable wings to harvest wave energy, while in robot mode, it folds the wings for a compact structure. The robot in U-WEC mode is designed with central symmetry and a float with low natural frequency, ensuring the adaptability to waves with random directions and low frequency. The operation principle of the robot is detailed along with the structure design. Then, a hydrodynamic model is established to calculate the motion responses of the robot in U-WEC mode. In the wave tank experiment, the dual-mode operation principle is first validated and then the wave energy conversion performance is tested, achieving an average power output of 2.59 W. Based on the proposed model verified with experimental results, the robot demonstrates insensitivity to wave directions and the capability to harness low-frequency waves, confirming its feasibility and potential for practical applications.

AB Integrating an ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) system into an underwater glider can theoretically enable the glider to achieve sustainable underwater propulsion without the need for resurfacing. Based on this concept, this paper proposes a closed-cycle OTEC system with latent heat storage. The system utilizes a condenser with encapsulated solid-liquid phase-change material to store cold energy in deep ocean and transport it to the surface along the glider's cruise path. To preliminarily assess the feasibility of this system and its application potential in underwater gliders, a thermodynamic model is developed to investigate its operational characteristics and adjustability. The results indicate that the system exhibits a net power generation of 1872.6 kJ during a single driving cycle, with a net thermal efficiency of 2.28 %. This electrical energy is sufficient to support the glider's power requirements. Moreover, under the designed conditions, the power generation process of the proposed system can be completed within 33 min, and the duration of the power generation process can be adjusted through the warm-seawater pump and the working-fluid pump to accommodate different operational states of the underwater glider. However, reducing the duration of the power generation process is accompanied by a decrease in the total power generation.

AB Ocean in-situ sensors are crucial for measuring oceanic parameters directly from the sea in a spatial and temporal basis. Real-time operation is used in many applications related to decision support tools and early warning services in case of accidents, incidents and/or disasters. The design of the proposed system is described as a rapid-response detection system, which aims to measure natural and artificial radioactive contaminants or other crucial ocean parameters, to replace the traditional method of sampling. The development of an interactive cellular system is undertaken using a commercial router that is programmed according to sensor specifications. A radioactivity sensor is integrated in a communication box enabling self-powered operation with a solar panel. The proposed system operates in (near) real-time mode and provides gamma-ray spectra by integrating the sensor and the appropriate electronic modules in it. Additionally, an on-site experiment was conducted to test the operability of the system in a real environment close to the sea, for monitoring fallout due to rainfall and snowfall events. The main intense radionuclides that were observed by different energy lines, were radon progenies (Bi-214, Pb-214). The continuous operation of the whole system was controlled by operating the system during the winter period.

AB Despite the enormous global potential of ocean wave energy, it has yet to achieve a level of maturity and economic competitiveness that would result in a substantial impact. Challenges include direct integration into weak or isolated microgrids, a high proportion of uncertain marine environments, nonlinear dynamics, oscillating water column (OWC) device limitations, slower response times, unplanned power outages, power fluctuations, high capital and operational costs in ocean wave energy conversion (OWEC) systems. To this end, a new independent multi-stage design approach is proposed for the performance enhancement of an OWC-based OWEC system. Firstly, an airflow and rotational speed optimal control stage enhances power capture in the Wells turbine-based OWC plant. Secondly, compared to conventional control, the proposed permanent magnet synchronous generator control incorporates an adaptive nonlinear back-stepping control algorithm based on Lyapunov stability theory. Thirdly, introducing reconfigurable control into the conventional six-leg power converter ensures the uninterrupted operation of an OWEC system. Lastly, a model-predictive control-based energy management system is integrated with a bidirectional DC-DC converter that delivers steady power from the gridconnected OWC OWEC system. Hence, MATLAB simulations ensure the overall performance enhancement and feasibility of the OWEC system application and verify that the proposed multi-stage solution is efficient, robust, and reliable.

AB Powering marine distributed buoys sustainably and cost-efficiently has always been challenging in the ocean environment. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG), thanks to their robustness, high efficiency and low cost in energy harvesting, has provided a novel solution to the long-term electrical power supply for a series of distributed systems (including buoys). In this study, a wave energy harvesting sandwich-like TENG (S-TENG) has been proposed. In the on-land forced motion experiments, the S-TENG yields much superior performances compared to previous tower-like TENG in terms of the power density. The studies also reveal that the electrical output increases linearly even with larger number of parallel connected S-TENG layers. Consequently, a buoy integrated with 7 parallel connected S-TENGs is studied through systematic wave basin experiments and the relevance of most hydrodynamic parameters (including wave height, frequency, direction as well as mooring system) have been revealed. The presented wave basin experiments are original in wave energy harvesting TENG research practice and prove to be very helpful in that they simulate the most close-to-real ocean environments in the lab. The studies are concluded with a 12 W high-brightness LED lit up on a navigation supporting buoy. This study has set a benchmark of achieving self-powered buoy with TENG, which can be extended to other marine distributed systems such as sensors and small robotics.

AB Ocean wave energy represents an essential source of green, low-cost, and renewable clean energy. Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) technology has demonstrated its potential for use in ocean wave energy harvesting. However, most TENG designs face challenges that include complex energy management and storage requirements, along with TENG output performance degradation at low ocean frequencies. Here, we present a pulsed arch-shaped double-layered direct-current TENG (aDC-TENG) that captures low-frequency ocean wave energy efficiently. Because of its arched structure, the system reduces operational resistance and converts ultralow vibrations from ocean waves at frequencies as low as 0.1 Hz into electrical energy. By using the electrostatic breakdown that is designed to occur between synergistically distributed electrodes, a unidirectional current loop is formed that generates unidirectional peak pulse currents as high as 23.5 mu A at 0.1 Hz. The integrated aDCTENG array, which is placed on the bottom of the buoy alongside small spheres, achieves automatic contact and separation through the coupled motion of the spheres and the ocean waves, thus enabling omni-directional harvesting of the energy from the ocean waves. The aDC-TENG was operated successfully in Sanya Bay and demonstrated remarkable environmental adaptability. Our research results have opened up a path toward the development of more efficient and convenient techniques for collection of the ocean wave energy required to drive a variety of sensors and other electronic devices.

AB The floating photovoltaic system is a new energy technology concept to meet the increasing energy requirements of our time. The system integrates existing land-based photovoltaic technologies with a newly-developed floating photovoltaic technology. K-water installed a 100 kW commercial demonstration plant at Hapcheon Dam, Korea in 2011. K-water also leads the domestic and overseas floating photovoltaic markets and installed the world's largest 500 kW floating photovoltaic facility at the time of its construction in 2012. Also, in October 2013, K-water tested the operation of an 11 kW ocean-floating photovoltaic demonstration plant (for research purposes) at the inland sea of the Sihwa Embankment in order to test the applicability of floating photovoltaic systems at sea. In this paper, the empirical data from 100 kW and 500 kW floating PV systems; a 100 kW tracking-type, floating PV system in a reservoir; and an 11 kW ocean-floating PV system were analyzed to determine their performance.

ID OPERATION
AB We introduce a novel offshore pumped hydro energy storage system, the Ocean Battery, which can be integrated with variable renewable energy sources to provide bulk energy storage. Its working principle is based on that of conventional pumped hydro storage with notable differences: the Ocean Battery is installed on the seabed, is powered by the hydrostatic pressure at the depth of deployment, and uses conditioned water as a working fluid within a closed hydraulic system to minimize the effects of corrosion and biofouling on the internal system. Herein we focus on the novel aspects of the Ocean Battery to investigate their effects on performance relative to that of conventional pumped hydro storage. Specifically, we present an analytical model that accounts for energy losses in the hydraulic system to predict pressures and flow velocities under different operating conditions and validate model predictions with measurements performed on an experimental small-scale prototype deployed in a relevant sea environment. Following validation, we use the model to estimate the round-trip efficiency of a scaled-up hydraulic system connected to pumps and turbines working at peak efficiencies, with the latter adopted from literature. The round-trip efficiency of such a scaled-up system is shown to be comparable to that of conventional pumped hydro storage.

AB With the rapid growth of distributed renewable energy systems, energy sharing brings a practical solution to mitigate mismatching between intermittent electricity generation and building demand. In past research, energy sharing was designed mostly for onshore energy integrated systems and is commonly realised with the assistance of microgrids, distributed battery storage, or peer-to-peer energy trading. This research innovatively proposed a distant energy sharing between the ocean energy-supported coastal office building and hotel building by ten electric vehicles, enabling the circulation of ocean renewable energy between two buildings. This project aims to accomplish maximum technical, environmental and economic benefits for the stakeholder. Using bidirectional vehicle-building interaction, advanced control algorithms, including shifting vehicle batches, sizing renewable capacity, and involving stationary batteries, are implemented successively in the TRNSYS simulation as analysis groups to enhance the current system's performance. According to the results, the vehicle-based bidirectional energy sharing between these two buildings can attain a relative net present value of 49.18 million HKD and a weighted matching index of 0.63. After implementing advanced controls with stationary batteries, the system achieved a relative net present value of 62.15 million HKD with an improved matching index of 0.70. Both batteries contributed to increase the matching performance of the system, but the increase in battery capacity reduces the benefit due to their replacement cost. This research developed an energy management system for effectively utilising electric vehicles and coastal renewable energy for distant energy sharing. It elucidated the technological, environmental, and economic benefits to the stakeholders for effective decision-making.

AB Limited energy is the most critical factor that restricts the persistent presence of underwater vehicles in the oceans; thus, harvesting the ocean's thermal energy that is stored in the water column between the sea surface and deep water is a particularly promising solution for the current power shortage. This paper has designed a new ocean thermal energy conversion system which using phase change material as energy storage medium, and proposed a novel maximum efficiency point tracking (MEPT) method for energy conversion. This new method, which is integrated with a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the proportion integration differentiation (PID) control method, could effectively improve the efficiency of energy conversion. Compared with the power generation system that does not use the MEPT method, experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the efficiency of the power generation from less than 19.05% to more than 34.3% and has higher stability (using this method: the efficiency changes from 34.3%-34.7%; without using this method: the efficiency changes from 13.56% -19.05%) when the load changes. This novel method can be used in many conditions, especially when the mathematical model of the generation system is unknown or researchers want to use fewer sensors for maximum efficiency point tracking.

AB In parallel with efforts to shift human societies' reliance from fossil fuel to renewable resources, in this paper, three green-based energy generation configurations were proposed and examined thermoeconomically. Afterwards, the one with the highest performance was selected for further investigation. The chosen system was empowered by an ocean thermal energy convertor (OTEC), a wind turbine, and a solar flat plate panel. The system was modeled by Engineering Equation Solver (EES) software to conduct sensitivity analysis by assessing the impact of changes in objective parameters on the net power output, thermoelectric generator (TEG) power output, exergy efficiency, and cost ratio. In the following steps, EES was coupled with MATLAB through Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), and a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) was employed for optimizing design parameters including solar panels' area, organic Rankine cycle (ORC) turbine inlet temperature, condenser outlet temperature, ORC pump and turbine efficiency, TEG figure of merit, and evaporator pinch point to reach the highest possible exergy efficiency and the least amount for cost ratio. The system performed with 13.88% exergy efficiency. The exergy destruction analysis showed wind turbine was the most exergy destructor in the system. The configuration is able to generate 448 kW power at its optimal point. Eventually, a case study for Bandar Abbas city, a coastal town in the south of Iran, is carried out to investigate the system's performance concerning the region's potential throughout a year. The results indicate that the system can potentially supply 38 Iranian households with electricity all year-round.

AB Ocean intelligent buoy is important for ocean environment monitoring. With the increase of requisite sensors and transportable data, a long power supply has become a problem to be solved urgently. In this work, a hybrid nanogenerator integrating triboelectric, piezoelectric, electromagnetic, photovoltaic, and thermotropic units is proposed to maximize ocean ambient energy harvesting, which includes static energy (solar and thermal energy) and dynamic energy (wave energy). Compared with a device with a single energy conversion mechanism, this structural design breaks the limit of harvesting time and natural conditions during the energy harvesting process, thereby increasing the harvested energy. Static energy harvesting is realized by the thermoelectric (TG) and photovoltaic (PV) units located inside the device and the PV unit attached to the device surface. Results show that the maximum open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current are 5 V and 41 mA in the external PV and 1.33 V and 49 mA in the internal PV under 30000 Lux illumination, respectively. The open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current of the TG unit are 5 V and 15 mA, respectively. The core component of the dynamic generation unit is the gimbal used to harvest wave energy by the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), piezoelectric generator (PENG), and electromagnetic generator. When the frequency is 2.4 Hz, the maximum peak-to-peak power of the TENG, PENG, and EMG are 0.25, 1.58, and 13.8 mW, respectively. Finally, an intelligent ocean buoy is fabricated by the integration of an energy harvester, a power management circuit, sensors, a microcontroller, and a wireless communication module. Driven by static and dynamic energy, temperature signal, humidity signal, GPS signal, and sound signal are sent to the receiving terminal wirelessly. The ocean energy harvester proposed in this work is of great significance for ocean energy harvesting and ocean wireless monitoring systems.

AB Ocean circulation redistributes Earth's energy and water masses and influences global climate. Under historical greenhouse warming, regional ocean currents show diverse tendencies, but whether there is an emerging trend of the global mean ocean circulation system is not yet clear. Here, we show a statistically significant increasing trend in the globally integrated oceanic kinetic energy since the early 1990s, indicating a substantial acceleration of global mean ocean circulation. The increasing trend in kinetic energy is particularly prominent in the global tropical oceans, reaching depths of thousands of meters. The deep-reaching acceleration of the ocean circulation is mainly induced by a planetary intensification of surface winds since the early 1990s. Although possibly influenced by wind changes associated with the onset of a negative Pacific decadal oscillation since the late 1990s, the recent acceleration is far larger than that associated with natural variability, suggesting that it is principally part of a long-term trend.

AB The reduced sensitivity of mean Southern Ocean zonal transport with respect to surface wind stress magnitude changes, known as eddy saturation, is studied in an idealized analytical model. The model is based on the assumption of a balance between surface wind stress forcing and bottom dissipation in the planetary geostrophic limit, coupled to the GEOMETRIC form of the Gent-McWilliams eddy parameterization. The assumption of a linear stratification, together with an equation for the parameterized domain integrated total eddy energy, enables the formulation of a two component dynamical system, which reduces to the non-linear oscillator of Ambaum and Novak (2014, ) in a Hamiltonian limit. The model suggests an intrinsic oscillatory time scale for the Southern Ocean, associated with a combination of mean shear erosion by eddies and eddy energy generation by the mean shear. For Southern Ocean parameters the model suggests that perturbing the system via stochastic wind forcing may lead to relatively large excursions in eddy energy.

AB Renewable energy is an increasingly vital field that continues to evolve with growing demands for innovative electricity production methods. Among these, Ocean Current Turbines (OCTs) have emerged as a promising technology that targets the vast energy potential of ocean currents. Building on established Hardware-in- the-Loop (HIL) methodologies primarily used in wind turbine testing, this research adapts and extends these techniques to develop a HIL testbed for OCTs. This research involves the development of a robust simulation model, designed to replicate the dynamic ocean current conditions impacting an OCT. The simulation is built with Simulink and is executed within Opal-RT's real-time simulation environment. The simulation model consists of an OCT rotor model outputting desired shaft torque values to a dynamometer which uses measured torque and speed feedback to integrate with a micro-grid setup. This model aims to operate in both Region 2 and Region 3 of power generation, as well as the transitional Region 2.5. A variable-speed controller is developed to maximize the power capture in Region 2 and is evaluated on the HIL testbed, a blade- pitch controller is employed to prevent over-generation in Region 3 and is simulated inside the real-time environment, and both of these controllers are evaluated simultaneously while operating in region 2.5 on the HIL testbed. This study demonstrates a simple yet effective approach to HIL simulation for marine energy systems. The findings reinforce the feasibility of HIL testing for OCTs and contribute valuable insights into the broader context of marine renewable energy technology development.

AB In this study, uncoupled and coupled ocean-atmosphere simulations are carried out for the California Upwelling System to assess the dynamic ocean-atmosphere interactions, namely, the ocean surface current feedback to the atmosphere. The authors show the current feedback, by modulating the energy transfer from the atmosphere to the ocean, controls the oceanic eddy kinetic energy (EKE). For the first time, it is demonstrated that the current feedback has an effect on the surface stress and a counteracting effect on the wind itself. The current feedback acts as an oceanic eddy killer, reducing by half the surface EKE, and by 27% the depth-integrated EKE. On one hand, it reduces the coastal generation of eddies by weakening the surface stress and hence the nearshore supply of positive wind work (i.e., the work done by the wind on the ocean). On the other hand, by inducing a surface stress curl opposite to the current vorticity, it deflects energy from the geostrophic current into the atmosphere and dampens eddies. The wind response counteracts the surface stress response. It partly reenergizes the ocean in the coastal region and decreases the offshore return of energy to the atmosphere. Eddy statistics confirm the current feedback dampens the eddies and reduces their lifetime, improving the realism of the simulation. Finally, the authors propose an additional energy element in the Lorenz diagram of energy conversion: namely, the current-induced transfer of energy from the ocean to the atmosphere at the eddy scale.

ID STRATEGY; STORAGE; SITE
AB Toward net zero emissions by 2050, efficient renewable energy systems and various energy interac-tions are increasingly proposed to improve energy matching and flexibility capacities. The existing studies primarily focused on onshore solar and wind energy sources, which can interact with electric vehicles or static batteries to improve the economic performance by the energy flexibility control. However, the hybrid system of ocean energy interacting with buildings and electric boats is rarely discussed. This study proposes an innovative integrated energy flexibility control to improve the techno-economic performance of a hybrid wave energy converter (WEC) and floating photovoltaic panel (FPV) energy system supporting a coastal hotel building and eight electric boats. We propose five control strategies, guaranteeing the normal excursion function of the boats while supporting enough energy for the building. In addition, two new indicators are presented to investigate the peak-shaving (PSI) and valley-filling (VFI) capabilities. A weighted matching index (WMI) is provided to investigate the overall energy matching capability. Annual electricity fees and relative net present value (NPVrel) are introduced to analyse the economy. To analyse the environmental aspect, we use the annual operational equivalent CO2 emissions (CEa) to track the emissions of the hybrid system. We observe that strategy E, integrated with the non-dominated solutions from the other four strategies, shows a significant profitable economic performance The annual electricity fee is reduced by 12.22%, and the NPVrel is improved by around 16.62%. PSI and VFI can reach 98.01% and 17.05% for a 100 kW line.(c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study proposes the integrated designs of energy systems and a re-liquefaction system for ocean-going LH2 tankers. Five prospective energy systems (Systems A to E) are suggested, using LNG as fuel, and a re-liquefaction system with a Claude cycle is developed. Their economic value, technological feasibility, and environmental impact are evaluated. The re-liquefaction systems' exergy efficiency and specific energy consumption ranges were 26.79-46.27% and 3-7.45 kWh/kg, respectively. The re-liquefaction system in System C is economically feasible up to $2/kg of H2. LCC of the integrated designs shows that System C has the lowest cost of $140 million. The shipping costs for each design are reviewed, and the lowest one is $447/ton of H2 for System C. Although System C CAPEX is the second expensive, it has the highest efficiency. Consequently, System C with the lowpressure engine, SOFC, and the re-liquefaction system is determined to be the optimal one. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID ENERGY; RESOURCE
AB The monitoring of currents in the abyssal ocean is an essential foundation of deep-sea research. The state-of-the-art current meter has limitations such as the requirement of a power supply for signal transduction, low pressure resistance, and a narrow measurement range. Here, we report a fully integrated, self-powered, highly sensitive deep-sea current measurement system in which the ultra-sensitive triboelectric nanogenerator harvests ocean current energy for the self-powered sensing of tiny current motions down to 0.02m/s. Through an unconventional magnetic coupling structure, the system withstands immense hydrostatic pressure exceeding 45MPa. A variable-spacing structure broadens the measuring range to 0.02-6.69m/s, which is 67% wider than that of commercial alternatives. The system successfully operates at a depth of 4531m in the South China Sea, demonstrating the record-deep operations of triboelectric nanogenerator-based sensors in deep-sea environments. Our results show promise for sustainable ocean current monitoring with higher spatiotemporal resolution.

AB This article proposes a multiport magnetic bus (MMB)-based novel wind-wave hybrid ocean energy technology (HOET). The ocean waves are mixed frequency waves and generate unique frequency spectra. The wave energy converters (WECs) connected to the linear permanent magnet generators generate voltages with varying amplitudes and frequencies due to the variation of the wind speed and direction. The proposed MMB of the proposed compact wind-wave HOET can provide galvanic isolation and allow a high-frequency operation of the MMB. A decoupled voltage and current control architecture is proposed to regulate the voltage and current waveforms in the high-frequency inverter modules of the MMB that can integrate multiple WECs. An Archimedes wave swing-based conversion method is utilized for the modeling and the design of the proposed WEC. A damping controller is designed to extract the maximum power from the irregular waves. For the wind-energy generation system, a doubly fed induction generator-based technology is considered. The simulation and the laboratory-scale experimental results validate the potential and the applicability of the proposed wind-wave HOET as an effective means to harness ocean energy.

AB Tides and Earth-Moon system evolution are coupled over geological time. Tidal energy dissipation on Earth slows Earth ' s rotation rate, increases obliquity, lunar orbit semi-major axis and eccentricity, and decreases lunar inclination. Tidal and core-mantle boundary dissipation within the Moon decrease inclination, eccentricity and semi-major axis. Here we integrate the Earth-Moon system backwards for 4.5 Ga with orbital dynamics and explicit ocean tide models that are "high-level" (i.e., not idealized). To account for uncertain plate tectonic histories, we employ Monte Carlo simulations, with tidal energy dissipation rates (normalized relative to astronomical forcing parameters) randomly selected from ocean tide simulations with modern ocean basin geometry and with 55, 116, and 252 Ma reconstructed basin paleogeometries. The normalized dissipation rates depend upon basin geometry and Earth ' s rotation rate. Faster Earth rotation generally yields lower normalized dissipation rates. The Monte Carlo results provide a spread of possible early values for the Earth-Moon system parameters. Of consequence for ocean circulation and climate, absolute (un-normalized) ocean tidal energy dissipation rates on the early Earth may have exceeded today ' s rate due to a closer Moon. Prior to similar to 3 Ga, evolution of inclination and eccentricity is dominated by tidal and core-mantle boundary dissipation within the Moon, which yield high lunar orbit inclinations in the early Earth-Moon system. A drawback for our results is that the semi-major axis does not collapse to near-zero values at 4.5 Ga, as indicated by most lunar formation models. Additional processes, missing from our current efforts, are discussed as topics for future investigation.

AB Data from turbulent numerical simulations of the global ocean demonstrate that the dissipation of kinetic energy obeys a nearly log-normal distribution even at large horizontal scales O(10 km). As the horizontal scales of resolved turbulence are larger than the ocean is deep, the Kolmogorov-Yaglom theory for intermittency in 3D homogeneous, isotropic turbulence cannot apply; instead, the down-scale potential enstrophy cascade of quasigeostrophic turbulence should. Yet, energy dissipation obeys approximate lognormality-robustly across depths, seasons, regions, and subgrid schemes. The distribution parameters, skewness and kurtosis, show small systematic departures from log-normality with depth and subgrid friction schemes. Log-normality suggests that a few high-dissipation locations dominate the integrated energy and enstrophy budgets, which should be taken into account when making inferences from simplified models and inferring global energy budgets from sparse observations.

AB Various wave energy converters (WECs) have been developed to utilize ocean wave energy resources. Among them, an oscillating water column (OWC) device is a promising wave energy converter that has undergone several pilot tests in the ocean with various prototype devices. Recently, a breakwater-integrated OWC-WEC system was proposed to improve the economic feasibility by reducing the construction and installation costs of the OWC chamber structure. In this study, a numerical investigation was conducted to simulate the hydrodynamic energy conversion problem for a breakwater-integrated OWC-WEC. The boundary value problem with the Laplace equation was solved directly by using a three-dimensional numerical wave tank based on a finite element method in the time domain. In the present numerical method, an efficient numerical model for the tetrapod (TTP), which is used to protect a rubble mound breakwater, was introduced using multiple blocks and numerical damping zone. Further, numerical investigations were performed on the effects of breakwater integration, TTP layer modeling, and the application of the numerical damping zone, and their features in terms of the wavefield and the OWC chamber responses were analyzed. Finally, the validity of the present numerical method was examined by comparing it with the experimental data.

AB Wave energy and ocean current energy are considered stable, reliable, and highly predictable renewable energy sources. The development of ocean current energy conversion technology is crucial in addressing power shortages. However, the low velocity of most ocean currents worldwide, typically less than 1.5 m/s, poses a challenge for traditional ocean current energy capture devices. Current estimations of power generation from underwater devices often significantly differ from actual results. This study presents an eel-type power generation device designed for underwater use, investigates the design and optimization of a hydraulic power take-off (PTO) system suitable for such devices, and examines key components of the hydraulic PTO system like variable hydraulic motors and generators. Analytical research was conducted to understand its operational characteristics, with a focus on components such as the accumulator, speed control valve, and energy storage flywheel. The article also delves into the hydrodynamic and energy conversion characteristics of the device under shallow water wave and current conditions, enhancing the hydraulic PTO system model and establishing an integrated calculation model for real-time data transmission during the calculation process. Through evaluations of pitch angle and power generation under varying sea conditions, the study explores the impact of hydraulic motor displacement and damping coefficient on the hydrodynamic and power generation characteristics of the device, further validated through sea trials. The study findings indicate a high level of parameter adaptation among the components of the hydraulic system. The addition of an accumulator to the system results in smoother output response curves, suggesting that the accumulator absorbs impacts and stabilizes the hydraulic power transmission system. The proposed comprehensive calculation method enables a more precise prediction of the performance of the eel power generation device in real marine environments, capturing its movement behavior and power generation characteristics. Adjusting the motor displacement or damping coefficient under specific conditions can optimize the total damping of the hydraulic PTO system for maximum power output. The optimal power point of the hydraulic power generation system varies for different sea conditions, with a potential power generation efficiency of up to 80.3% under certain circumstances.

AB The primary goal of this study is to develop and test a small-scale horizontal-axis underwater Ocean Current Turbine (OCT) by creating a mathematical model for coupled dynamics aided by a Blade Element Momentum (BEM) simulation-integrated experimental approach. This research is motivated by the urgent need for sustainable energy sources and the vast potential of ocean currents. By integrating mathematical modeling with the experimental testing of scaled model OCTs, this study aims to evaluate performance accurately. The experimental setup involves encapsulating a 3D-printed turbine model within a watertight nacelle which is equipped with sensors for comprehensive data recording during towing tank tests. Through these experiments, we seek to establish correlations between the generated power, force, and rotational speed of the turbine's Permanent Magnet DC (PMDC) motor, which determines the turbine's capability to extract dynamic energy inflow. Moreover, this research aims to provide valuable insights into the accuracy and applicability of theoretical predictions in real-world scenarios by comparing the experimental results with BEM simulations. This combined approach not only advances our understanding of hydrokinetic energy conversion, but also contributes to the development of reliable and efficient renewable energy technologies that address global energy challenges while mitigating environmental impacts.

AB The ocean harbors an abundance of resources, encompassing not only wave energy but also considerable wind energy. Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), as a technology for harvesting low-frequency, high-entropy mechanical energy, has shown distinct advantages in the collection and application of marine and wind energy. This study introduces a triboelectric Wind and wave energy harvester (TWWEH), an energy collector based on TENG, which can be used to harness wind and wave energy. The TWWEHs comprise a wind-driven TENG (W-TENG) for wind energy collection and a ring-shaped TENG (R-TENG) for wave energy collection. The proposed vertically integrated TENG architecture enhances spatial utilization rate. Under oscillatory conditions of 0.8 Hz and +/- 30 degrees, the R-TENG generates a peak power of 0.20 mW. While at a wind speed of 10 m s(-1), a peak power of the W-TENG can reach 0.11 mW. This research provides a promising solution to harvest wave and wind energy from the ocean, offering significant potential applications in establishing self-powered oceanic assessment and meteorological systems.

AB Introduction: The study presents an integrated system comprising a central platform and four wave-energy converters, with a focus on investigating their coupled motions induced by ocean waves. The interaction between the buoys and the central platform is achieved through the implementation of spring components. The power take-off system is simulated by incorporating damping coefficients and stiffness into these spring components, enabling a detailed analysis of the energy conversion of such system.Methods: Numerical simulations based on the continuity equation and the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, coupled with the realizable k - epsilon turbulence model, are conducted. The two-phase flow model employs the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method to accurately capture free surface elevations. Additionally, frequency-domain predictions, based on the linearized velocity potential flow theory, are provided for a single central platform and buoy for comparative purposes.Results: Detailed results regarding the effects of wave frequency and the damping coefficient of the power take-off system are presented.Discussion: The results reveal that while both the platform's motion and the relative motions between buoys and the platform are suppressed, the absolute motion of buoys varies depending on their respective locations within the system and ocean waves. This variation is deeply influenced by the interaction between incident, reflected and diffracted waves within the system.

AB This study develops an autonomous ocean observation system designed for continuous, multidimensional marine parameter monitoring. The system integrates sensor-based monitoring and sample collection capabilities, utilizing tidal energy to facilitate vertical movement within the water column (0-50 m). The system combines tidal energy utilization with a buoyancy regulation unit, significantly reducing reliance on conventional battery power while maintaining the system's flexibility in deep control, demonstrating superior energy efficiency compared to traditional platforms. The combination of sensor monitoring and sample acquisition enables real-time acquisition of oceanographic parameters (e.g., temperature, salinity, chlorophyll) and on-demand water sample collection for high-precision laboratory analysis. Laboratory and sea trials validated its ability to perform reciprocating vertical motion, autonomous buoyancy regulation, and leak-free sample collection, confirming feasibility for long-term coastal ecosystem monitoring. This study highlights the potential of autonomous systems for sustainable ocean observation and environmental monitoring.

AB To harness the endless hydrokinetic energy of the Kuroshio current, the joint research team of the National Taiwan University and the National Taiwan Ocean University has developed a floating Kuroshio turbine (FKT) system in Taiwan. In normal operation, the system floats at a certain small depth from the ocean surface to reduce the wave effects and take advantage of faster current speeds. In the present study, the effect of the mooring line on the system dynamics is investigated computationally. Two different auxiliary mooring line designs and, for each design, three different common mooring lines (polyester ropes of neutral buoyancy, iron chains, and 6x19 wires ropes with wire core) are examined. The study makes use of several commercial and in-house packages, integrated to find various coefficients. It is found that the mooring line, the auxiliary mooring line design, and the gravity centre can have a significant effect on system fluctuations in normal operation if the combination of these factors is not properly matched.

ID TRIBOELECTRIC NANOGENERATOR; ENERGY; INTERNET; CHALLENGES
AB The internet of things in the context of the ocean is vitally important. For ships sailing on the wide ocean in adverse weather conditions, evasion of marine islands and reefs is crucial to ensure safe navigation. Here, a hybrid wave energy harvesting nanogenerator is proposed (HW-NG) as a power source for long-distance wireless transmission, and demonstrated a self-powered route avoidance warning system for ocean navigation. The HW-NG is developed based on a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and an electromagnetic generator (EMG), integrated by a pendulum structure. The TENG based on a contact-separation mode is designed into a spring-assisted multilayered structure, in which the EMG unit is well hybridized. Simply relying on the energy extracted from water waves, the HW-NG can establish long-distance (1.5 km) communication nodes on the sea. In application, a large HW-NG network could be developed in the adjacent water areas of islands or reefs. With a network formed by hundreds of thousands of HW-NGs, the forewarning signal transmission could be realized per second on the sea. More importantly, the wireless emitting is spontaneous through the designed automatic switch module. This work demonstrates a practicable strategy for ensuring safety of sea transportation based on wave energy collection.

AB Marine phytoplankton and associated organic materials absorb a substantial quantity of solar shortwave energy penetrating the upper ocean. Most of this absorbed energy is lost as heat and thereby contributes to the warming of near-surface waters. Here we examine this biothermal feedback effect on upper ocean physics and air-sea energy exchange using a fully integrated ocean-atmosphere-biological modeling system. Our model simulations show that a local phytoplankton bloom may impact upper ocean physics in such a way as to promote the spatiotemporal persistence of the bloom itself within a semi-enclosed coastal embayment. This is accomplished primarily via enhanced thermal stratification that promotes vertical stability and more efficient utilization of macronutrients. Modulations of wind stress patterns due to perturbations in the local surface pressure gradients also arise as a result of the simulated biothermal warming of surface waters. The model evidence suggests that the observed persistence of phytoplankton blooms in the northern Monterey Bay, California, may be enhanced by similar synergistic interactions between ocean biology and physics.

AB Microbial-influenced corrosion and marine biofouling have become a thorny problem restricting the effective long-term operation of marine engineering. In this study, a novel antibacterial coating system for marine corrosion and fouling control was developed to integrate and improve the antibacterial performance. The coating system was composed of an epoxy primer and a low surface energy organosilicon/polyurethane topcoat, while quaternary ammonium salt (QAS) was added as an antimicrobial agent. The primer provided excellent corrosion protection. The antifouling performance was significantly improved by the combined effect of low surface energy and antibacterial agents, resulting in an extended service life and enhanced environmental sustainability of the coating system. Furthermore, the satisfactory results of the above coating system were confirmed by 8 weeks of hanging tests in the ocean, which exhibited potential application prospects in marine engineering in the future.

AB Ocean energy is a relevant source of clean renewable energy, and as it is still facing challenges related to its above grid-parity costs, tariffs intended to support in a structured and coherent way are of great relevance and potential impact. The logistics and marine operations required for installing and maintaining these systems are major cost drivers of marine renewable energy projects. Planning the logistics of marine energy projects is a highly complex and intertwined process, and to date, limited advances have been made in the development of decision support tools suitable for ocean energy farm design. The present paper describes the methodology of a novel, open-source, logistic and marine operation planning tool, integrated within DTOceanPlus suite of design tools, and responsible for producing logistic solutions comprised of optimal selections of vessels, port terminals, equipment, as well as operation plans, for ocean energy projects. Infrastructure selection logistic functions were developed to select vessels, ports, and equipment for specific projects. A statistical weather window model was developed to estimate operation delays due to weather. A vessel charter rate modeling approach, based on an in-house vessel database and industry experience, is described in detail. The overall operation assumptions and underlying operating principles of the statistical weather window model, maritime infrastructure selection algorithms, and cost modeling strategies are presented. Tests performed for a case study based a theoretical floating wave energy converter produced results in good agreement with reality.

AB This article reports the off-design performance analysis of a closed-cycle ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) system when a solar thermal collector is integrated as an add-on preheater or superheater. Design-point analysis of a simple OTEC system was numerically conducted to generate a gross power of 100 kW, representing a base OTEC system. In order to improve the power output of the OTEC system, two ways of utilizing solar energy are considered in this study: (1) preheating of surface seawater to increase its input temperature to the cycle and (2) direct superheating of the working fluid before it enters a turbine. Obtained results reveal that both preheating and superheating cases increase the net power generation by 20-25% from the design-point. However, the preheating case demands immense heat load on the solar collector due to the huge thermal mass of the seawater, being less efficient thermodynamically. The superheating case increases the thermal efficiency of the system from 1.9% to around 3%, about a 60% improvement, suggesting that this should be a better approach in improving the OTEC system. This research provides thermodynamic insight on the potential advantages and challenges of adding a solar thermal collection component to OTEC power plants. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We analyse a large number of multi-century pre-industrial control simulations from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) to investigate relationships between: net top-of-atmosphere radiation (TOA), globally averaged surface temperature (GST), and globally integrated ocean heat content (OHC) on decadal timescales. Consistent with previous studies, we find that large trends (similar to 0.3 K dec(-1)) in GST can arise from internal climate variability and that these trends are generally an unreliable indicator of TOA over the same period. In contrast, trends in total OHC explain 95% or more of the variance in TOA for two-thirds of the models analysed; emphasizing the oceans' role as Earth's primary energy store. Correlation of trends in total system energy (TE = time integrated TOA) against trends in OHC suggests that for most models the ocean becomes the dominant term in the planetary energy budget on a timescale of about 12 months. In the context of the recent pause in global surface temperature rise, we investigate the potential importance of internal climate variability in both TOA and ocean heat rearrangement. The model simulations suggest that both factors can account for O (0.1 W m(-2)) on decadal timescales and may play an important role in the recently observed trends in GST and 0-700 m (and 0-1800 m) ocean heat uptake.

AB As water covers most of the earth's surface, the energy of the ocean is abundant and almost unexplored, which can be one of the most environmentally friendly forms of energy. Prevention of metal corrosion plays an important role in national economic development and daily life. Here, we report a network of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) and supercapacitors (SCs), which is also called the self-powered system, to harvest a huge amount of water energy for preventing metal corrosion. When the TENG is integrated with a SC, the output current is stable and continuous. The corrosion results indicate that the TENG-SC self-powered system can prevent about 80% degree of corrosion for Q235 steel in 0.5 M NaCl solution. This work demonstrates that the TENG-SC system, which is self-powered, flexible and environmentally friendly, can harvest and store large-scale blue energy from the ocean, and also renders an innovative approach toward preventing the metal corrosion without other power sources.

LA English
DT Article
DE Air-sea interaction; Numerical modelling; Turbulence
ID GLASS-TRANSITION; CIRCULATION; SEA
AB We consider air-sea interaction at the (atmospheric) synoptic and the mesoscale due to momentum transfer only. Two superposed one-layer fine-resolution shallow-water models are numerically integrated, where the upper layer represents the atmosphere and the lower layer the ocean. The frictional force between the two layers is implemented using a quadratic drag law and experiments with different values of the surface drag coefficient are performed. The actual energy loss of the atmosphere and the energy gain by the ocean, due to the interfacial shear, is determined and compared to estimates based on average speeds. The correlation between the vorticity in the atmosphere and the ocean is determined. Results differ from previous investigations where the exchange of momentum was considered at basin scale. It is shown that the ocean has a passive role, absorbing kinetic energy at nearly all times and locations, results showing that the energy input to the ocean increases almost quadratically with the value of the drag coefficient. Due to the feeble velocities in the ocean, the energy transfer depends only weakly on the oceanic velocity. The ocean dynamics leave nevertheless their imprint on atmospheric dynamics, leading to a quenched disordered state of the atmosphere-ocean system for the highest value of the drag coefficient considered. This finding questions the ergodic hypothesis for the idealized configuration studied here. The ergodic hypothesis is at the basis of a large number of experimental, observational and numerical results in ocean, atmosphere and climate dynamics.

TI Development and evaluation of a new 4DEnVar-based weakly coupled ocean

DT Article
ID INITIALIZATION; MODEL
AB The development, implementation, and evaluation of a new weakly coupled ocean data assimilation (WCODA) system for the fully coupled Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2 (E3SMv2) utilizing the four-dimensional ensemble variational (4DEnVar) method are presented in this study. The 4DEnVar method, based on the dimension-reduced projection four-dimensional variational (DRP-4DVar) approach, replaces the adjoint model with the ensemble technique, thereby reducing computational demands. Monthly mean ocean temperature and salinity data from the EN4.2.1 reanalysis are integrated into the ocean component of E3SMv2 from 1950 to 2021 with the goal of providing realistic initial conditions for decadal predictions and predictability studies. The performance of the WCODA system is assessed using various metrics, including the reduction rate of the cost function, root mean square error (RMSE) differences, correlation differences, and model biases. Results indicate that the WCODA system effectively assimilates the reanalysis data into the climate model, consistently achieving negative reduction rates of the cost function and notable improvements in RMSE and correlation across various ocean layers and regions. Significant enhancements are observed in the upper ocean layers across the majority of global ocean regions, particularly in the north Atlantic, north Pacific, and Indian Ocean. Model biases in sea surface temperature and salinity are also substantially reduced. For sea surface temperature, cold biases in the north Pacific and north Atlantic are diminished by about 1-2 degrees C, and warm biases in the Southern Ocean are corrected by approximately 1.5-2.5 degrees C. In terms of salinity, improvements are observed with bias reductions of about 0.5-1 psu in the north Atlantic and north Pacific and up to 1.5 psu in parts of the Southern Ocean. The ultimate goal of the WCODA system is to advance the predictive capabilities of E3SM for subseasonal to decadal climate predictions, thereby supporting research on strategic energy-sector policies and planning.

AB Offshore renewable energy technologies offer a promising prospect for energy supply on offshore islands. However, traditional wind and solar energy sources exhibit strong variability and cannot fully meet the energy demands of users. At the same time, the energy demand of users also has great volatility, so the supply side and demand side of energy cannot match well. Existing renewable energy systems often utilize thermal power generation as a stabilizer for the system, however, this approach is difficult to apply in offshore conditions. This study introduces an innovative multi-energy complementary system that integrates seawater freezing desalination, refrigeration and power-hydrogen-ammonia co-generation, driven by ocean thermal energy, wind energy, and solar energy. The system incorporates the use of a new developed small temperature difference ejector refrigeration cycle to stabilize the entire system and produce low-temperature refrigeration. By utilizing the seawater freezing desalination process to minimize energy conversion losses and balancing fluctuations in multiple energy inputs and user demands through ammonia-hydrogen co-production, this approach effectively minimizes energy waste, enhances energy utilization efficiency, and reduces excess power handling. The purpose is to optimize the configuration of the energy conversion subsystem within the multi-energy complementary multi-effect co-generation system, thus improving the economic feasibility and reliability of the system in providing energy and freshwater supply, ultimately achieving the goals of reducing energy waste, achieving high conversion efficiency, and minimizing equipment investment. This study conducts an economic analysis and optimization of a multi-energy complementary system, utilizing a 2 MW-level OTEC subsystem as a stabilizer. Both equipment investment and operating costs are considered in the economy analysis. The carbon emission reduction performance of this system is evaluated. The performance optimization results show that the system achieves an energy storage efficiency of 65.96 %, and the curtailment rate of this system is only 3.99 %, significantly lower than the 10 % curtailment rate in traditional system. The proposed system can meet the annual electricity demand of 33.09 million kWh, as well as a cooling demand of 546.81 million kWh. Under typical conditions, the ocean thermal energy conversion cycle exhibits a power efficiency of 0.85 % and a refrigeration efficiency of 29.10 %. Meanwhile, it annually reduces CO2 emissions by 2.54 million tons, demonstrating significant environmental benefits. This proposed system is mainly applicable to tropical waters with high surface water temperatures and depths of no less than 600 m worldwide. This study offers a practical and economically beneficial solution for energy and freshwater supply on offshore islands.

AB Among the main components of a smart city, the energy system plays a vital and core role in the transition towards a sustainable urban life. Furthermore, the utilization of renewable energy sources has been demonstrated as a significant contribution to reducing pollutant emissions and enhancing the quality of the living environment. Therefore, designing the energy systems based on clean and renewable criteria is considered a sustainable solution for smart cities. Indeed, the deep and rapid penetration of renewable energy-based technologies have been believed to very well fit into a smart city under various scales, this could supply a secure basis for a modern society with a low-carbon economy. In this review paper, the main components and roles of renewable energy resources (such as solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, ocean, and biofuels) for the smart city were fully introduced. Besides, integrating the renewable sources form into the energy systems of smart cities was thoroughly analyzed on the basis of technical and economic criteria. Finally, existing challenges and future scenarios were also discussed in detail to clarify the progress and perspective of smart renewable energy systems for the smart city. In general, the integration of renewables into energy systems of the smart city is a sagacious perspective and solution aiming to achieve cleaner process and more sustainable development. However, the optimization issues of the energy system for integrating of renewable components, ensuring good stability, maximizing the operating range, and minimizing the investment costs should be critically evaluated in the future works.

AB Understanding the governing mechanisms of atmosphere-wave-ocean interactions is critical for unravelling the formation and evolution mechanisms of severe weather phenomena. This study aims at investigating the effects of atmosphere-wave-ocean feedbacks on a Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone (medicane), occurred on 27-30 September 2018 at the central-eastern Mediterranean Sea and characterized by severe environmental and socioeconomic impact. To unveil the interactions across the air-sea interface, the medicane was simulated by an integrated modelling system consisting of the Chemical Hydrological Atmospheric Ocean wave System (CHAOS), upgraded by embedding to it the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) as ocean circulation component. Coupled simulations revealed that air-sea heat transfer and Ekman pumping, bringing sub-surface cold waters in upper ocean layers (upwelling), caused SST cooling (similar to 2-3 degrees C). SST cooling triggered a negative feedback loop procedure tending to balance between atmospheric and ocean processes. It also attenuated the cyclone and, subsequently, reduced the atmospheric energy embedded in ocean through the upper ocean vertical stratification weakening, thus, upper ocean vertical mixing, upwelling and SST cooling. The waves adjusted this feedback loop making the system more resistant in air-sea flux variations. Waves additionally weakened the cyclone not only due to the kinetic energy loss in the lower-atmosphere but also due to the enhancement of SST cooling which is attributed to the strengthening of Ekman pumping and vertical mixing, forced by wind stress increase. Nevertheless, waves partially balanced the air-wave-sea exchanges through the slight enthalpy flux gain under high wind conditions which is explained by considering the increase of enthalpy transfer coefficient in rougher sea areas.

AB The proportion of renewable energy in the power supply has experienced substantial growth; however, its intermittent nature and inherent uncertainty present notable challenges in its integration. This study aims to explore the significance of energy flexibility in energy management by focusing on a hybrid renewable wavewind zero-energy system implemented in a coastal building. Specifically, the study investigates various sources of flexibility within the system and introduces a novel energy storage mechanism utilising the in-built reservoir of the wave energy converter. The research provides new insights into the flexibility of control strategies from the generation and storage sides. The cost-responsive controls involved on/off-peak periods and monthly variations. Several attempts have been made to develop cost-responsive controls that depend upon the electricity tariffs; these include energy shift and peak shaving. The lower discharging limits and trigger lines were compared in the simulation environment to improve the cost-saving, energy-matching, and peak-shaving performances. In this study, the first group scheduled discharging; however, only limited improvements (0.5%) were achieved. Consequently, the second group shifted to varying the minimum fraction state of the reservoir under a lower discharging limit, which reduced operational cost by 4.5%. Using different discharging lines by considering the current month and the period, the third group achieved the expected peak shaving and correspondingly reduced the operational cost to 90.3 %. The final group showed that an additional battery could improve the peak-shaving and cost-saving performance but not the net present value, owing to high investment costs. Furthermore, annual savings increased for different battery capacities from 4.5 % to 6.8 % by conducting the energy shift. Peak shaving control with additional battery reduced maximum demand and substantially reduced costs from 6.4% to 10.8 %. The study recommends focusing on peak shaving with extra batteries for further cost savings during the on-peak period. This research brings novelty by integrating flexibility control for both generation- and storage-sides in ocean renewable energy systems. It proposes using a wave energy converter as a mechanical energy storage reservoir, reducing costs and ensuring adequate capacity. The study emphasises dynamic storage control, adjusting in real time based on conditions and energy demands.

AB A design, simulation, and optimization of a solar-enhanced ocean thermal energy conversion system for the simultaneous production of power and liquid hydrogen are proposed. This study explores a novel approach to enhancing ocean thermal energy conversion performance by integrating solar thermal collectors with nanofluids, thereby augmenting the exergy efficiency and system economics. Incorporating solar thermal flat plate collectors with nanofluid as an additional heat source increased power generation through the organic Rankine cycle. EES software performs thermodynamic modeling, while data analysis uses artificial neural networks. The multiobjective grey wolf optimizer algorithm is enacted to ascertain the most advantageous operational parameters for the chosen working fluids of the organic Rankine cycle (R134a, R245fa, R290, and R600). The TOPSIS decision-making method was then applied to assess and contrast the performance of working fluids. The findings revealed that R245fa emerged as the supremely optimal working fluid, exhibiting the best performance among the options considered. It achieved a peak exergy efficiency of 12.62 % alongside a maximal mass flow rate of liquefied hydrogen production reaching 25.53 kg/h. The total investment rate is minimized to 383.38 $/h. The associated study offers a foundation for further investigating and commercializing ocean thermal energy conversion technology in the hydrogen energy sector.

AB Hydrogen is emerging as a dominant energy carrier in the 21st Century in the transition to sustainable energy, yet its production and storage remain costly and energy-intensive, limiting its widespread adoption. This paper explores the integration of a 10 MW Hybrid Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (H-OTEC) offshore plant with electrolysis to produce green hydrogen. H-OTEC generates renewable electricity using ocean thermal gradients while simultaneously producing desalinated water, eliminating the need for additional infrastructure. This paper evaluates the performance and economic viability of integrating H-OTEC with Alkaline and Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Electrolyzers. The analysis considers three major regional markets, including the United States, Europe, and China, to explore the economic benefits of electrolyzer integration with H-OTEC. Results show that the PEM Electrolyzer consumes more water (634 kg/hr) than the Alkaline Electrolyzer (516 kg/hr) while producing 3.58 % less hydrogen (539 Nm3/hr vs. 559 Nm3/hr). Alkaline Electrolyzer benefit from lower Capital Expenditures (CapEx) and Operational Expenditures (OpEx), while PEM Electrolyzer offer higher hydrogen purity at a higher cost. Regional cost comparisons across the United States, Europe, and China highlight that China has the lowest CapEx and Europe achieves the highest OpEx savings potential. Long-term projections indicate that H-OTEC integration could save between approximately $218,000 and $645,000 over a 10-year period, depending on electrolyzer type and region. H-OTEC provides sufficient desalinated water, producing 6.48 x 105 kg/hr with electrolysis requiring only 0.08 % for the Alkaline Electrolyzer and 0.1 % for the PEM Electrolyzer. This paper highlights the feasibility and economic advantages of an H-OTEC offshore plant for large-scale hydrogen production, offering a viable alternative to land-based renewable energy systems.

AB Shipboard integrated power systems (SIPSs) usually have multifaceted operational objectives in engineering scenarios, and many key tasks are performed by multiple pulsed power loads (PPLs) with a high power density. Owing to the complexity of the ocean environment, the optimization of SIPS comprehensive performance remains challenging. This article proposes a multiobjective energy management strategy of multiple PPLs in SIPSs. A multiobjective energy coordination model is formulated. By identifying typical operation modes of the SIPS based on discrepant priority, the PPL utility and maneuverability are incorporated into the comprehensive regulation objective in the form of a weighted sum. In the case of limited energy supply, the service duration is further considered in the optimization objective to meet the high survivability requirements. Reasonable methods are adopted to quantitatively evaluate different performances. Moreover, to improve SIPS survivability in the face of emergencies, a system-level energy allocation scheme with maneuverability enhancement is formulated to coordinate the power consumption of different functions. A particle swarm optimization algorithm with directional guidance and selective evaluation of the nonconvex constraint is proposed to solve the optimization problem effectively. Case studies on a typical SIPS under various working scenarios are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Ocean renewables, including offshore wind and wave energy, are plentiful and crucial energy sources for attaining future emission-free goals. Nevertheless, their power generation processes are intermittent and unstable, which mandates the utilization of energy storage systems to mitigate power fluctuations. In light of this challenge, this study designs a Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) composed of supercapacitors and lithium iron phosphate batteries integrating wind and wave energies. Through the application of improved moving average filter and amplitude limiting filter algorithm, it proficiently regulates power fluctuations, secures the stability of grid connection, and reasonably allocates grid-connected power and energy storage power. Then, the variational mode decomposition (VMD) is adopted to decompose the original power generation. Subsequently, the Hilbert transform is employed to ascertain the frequency for frequency division, thereby enabling a reasonable distribution of energy storage power between supercapacitors and lithium iron phosphate batteries. Taking into account the state of charge constraints of the hybrid energy storage system, the present work aims to minimize the annual comprehensive cost by optimizing rated power and capacity of the HESS. The results show that the improved moving average filter and amplitude limiting filter algorithm (IMAF-ALF) can smooth the grid connection fluctuation of offshore energy and optimize the HESS capacity effectively.

AB In many remote areas, expensive fossil fuels such as diesel are used to meet local electricity demand. However, their environmental impact is significant. Consequently, some of these areas have started to use hybrid systems that combine renewable energy sources and fossil fuel generation, such as wind-diesel systems, although wind is not feasible in some remote locations and fossil fuels remain the only resource in these areas. Fortunately, offshore renewable energy sources are available in many remote areas close to the ocean. In order to understand the feasibility of using offshore renewables in remote oceanic areas, we recently conducted a systematic study by developing an integrated model. This model includes a supply module, demand module, environmental impact module, and integrating module. Using this model, we mainly study the reduction in emissions resulting from offshore renewable energy penetration in local energy systems. In this article, we present this integrated model, and an example study of tidal energy in the Southern Alaska community of Elfin Cove, which relies on diesel fuel for all of its electricity requirements. With 56 kW of tidal power penetrating the energy system, we found that almost 12,000 gallons of diesel fuel are displaced per year. This results in an annual emissions reduction of almost 244,000 lb CO2 and about 1400 lb CO, as well as considerable reductions of PM-10, NOx, and SOx. The newly developed integrated model is expected to be used to analyze other aspects of tidal energy (and offshore renewable energy in general) in remote areas. For example, since the electricity demand in some remote areas varies significantly throughout the year, we recommend that tidal power should be used with a storage system.

AB This work presents a multi-objective optimization approach to designing integrated water supply systems for the mining industry. The main goal is to estimate the total operational costs and greenhouse gas emissions from water supply systems. Chilean mining industry has been selected as a case study because of acute problem of water scarcity that it experiences. The current strategy to face the problem applied by the mining companies operating in Chile consists in building independent water supply systems that use ocean as the source of water. This solution is highly energy intensive, which is why the problem of water consumption is also a problem of energy consumption. The proposed optimization approach determines - from technical, economic and environmental perspective - the optimal topology of the system, optimal locations and sizes of water treatment plants, pumping stations, and pipelines. In addition, the analysis takes into account the eventual use of photovoltaic solar system in order to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Our main findings have demonstrated that an integrated water supply system is always the best option from an economic and environmental point of view. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is a significant energy transition in progress globally. This is mainly driven by the insertion of variable sources of energy, such as wind and solar power. To guarantee that the supply of energy meets its demand, energy storage technologies will play an important role in integrating these intermittent energy sources. Daily energy storage can be provided by batteries. However, there is still no technology that can provide weekly, monthly and seasonal energy storage services where pumped hydro storage is not a viable solution. Herein, we introduce an innovative energy storage proposal based on isothermal air compression/decompression and storage of the compressed air in the deep sea. Isothermal deep ocean compressed air energy storage (IDO-CAES) is estimated to cost from 1500 to 3000 USD/kW for installed capacity and 1 to 10 USD/kWh for energy storage. IDO-CAES should complement batteries, providing weekly, monthly and seasonal energy storage cycles in future sustainable energy grids, particularly in coastal areas, islands and offshore and floating wind power plants, as well as deep-sea mining activities.

AB The formation of hybrid underwater gliders has advantages in sustained ocean observation with high resolution and more adaptation for complicated ocean tasks. However, the current work mostly focused on the traditional gliders and AUVs. The research on control strategy and energy consumption minimization for the hybrid gliders is necessary both in methodology and experiment. A multi-layer coordinate control strategy is developed for the fleet of hybrid underwater gliders to control the gliders' motion and formation geometry with optimized energy consumption. The inner layer integrated in the onboard controller and the outer layer integrated in the ground control center or the deck controller are designed. A coordinate control model is proposed based on multibody theory through adoption of artificial potential fields. Considering the existence of ocean flow, a hybrid motion energy consumption model is constructed and an optimization method is designed to obtain the heading angle, net buoyancy, gliding angle and the rotate speed of screw propeller to minimize the motion energy with consideration of the ocean flow. The feasibility of the coordinate control system and motion optimization method has been verified both by simulation and sea trials. Simulation results show the regularity of energy consumption with the control variables. The fleet of three Petrel-II gliders developed by Tianjin University is deployed in the South China Sea. The trajectory error of each glider is less than 2.5 km, the formation shape error between each glider is less than 2 km, and the difference between actual energy consumption and the simulated energy consumption is less than 24% actual energy. The results of simulation and the sea trial prove the feasibility of the proposed coordinate control strategy and energy optimization method. In conclusion, a coordinate control system and a motion optimization method is studied, which can be used for reference in theoretical research and practical fleet operation for both the traditional gliders and hybrid gliders.

AB Ocean-going ships are one of the primary sources of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Several actions are being taken to reduce the GHG emissions from maritime vessels, and integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) is one of them. Ocean-going marine ships need a large amount of reliable energy to support the propulsive load. Intermittency is one of the drawbacks of RESs, and penetration of RESs in maritime vessels is limited by the cargo carrying capacity and usable area of that ship. Other types of reliable energy sources need to be incorporated in ships to overcome these shortcomings of RESs. Some researchers proposed to integrate fossil fuel-based generators like diesel generators and renewable energy in marine vessels to reduce GHG emissions. As the penetration of RESs in marine ships is limited, fossil fuel-based generators provide most of the energy. Therefore, renewable and fossil fuel-based hybrid energy systems in maritime vessels can not reduce GHG emissions to the desired level. Fossil fuel-based generators need to be replaced by emissions-free energy sources to make marine ships free from emissions. Nuclear energy is emissions-free energy, and small-scale nuclear reactors like Microreactors (MRs) are competent to replace fossil fuel-based generators. In this paper, the technical, environmental, and economic competitiveness of Nuclear-Renewable Hybrid Energy Systems (N-R HES) in marine ships are assessed. The lifecycle cost of MR, reliability of the proposed system, and limitations of integrating renewable energy in maritime vessels are considered in this study. The proposed N-R HES is compared with three different energy systems, namely 'Standalone Fossil Fuel-based Energy Systems', 'Renewable and Fossil Fuel-based Hybrid Energy Systems', and 'Standalone Nuclear Energy System'. The cost modeling of each energy system is carried out in MATLAB simulator. Each energy system is optimized by using the Differential Evolution Algorithm (DEA), an artificial intelligence algorithm, to find out the optimal configuration of the system components in terms of Net Present Cost (NPC). The results determine that N-R HES has the lowest NPC compared to the other three energy systems. The performance of the DE algorithm is compared with another widely accepted artificial intelligence optimization technique called 'Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)' to validate the findings of the DE algorithm. The impact of control parameters in the DE algorithm is assessed by employing the Adaptive Differential Evolution (ADE) algorithm. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to assess the impact of different system parameters on this study's findings.

AB For effective integrity management of marine renewable energy systems in the dynamic and uncertain ocean environments, understanding the failure dynamics is crucial. The cost of investment in marine/offshore renewable energy infrastructures and the associated cost due to failure and loss of energy production necessitate a predictive monitoring methodology that is dynamic and adaptive. This paper presents an integrated multi-state pure-birth-pure-death Markovian-net profit value model for the offshore turbine subsystem failure analysis and its cost-based consequences. The integrated model captures the offshore turbine subsystem's dynamic failure states and its economic implications due to the cost of energy loss and downtime for the period under consideration. The model applies a phase-type exponential distribution to describe the monotonic state of failure. The methodology is demonstrated with an offshore wind turbine gearbox, and it captures the dynamic state of the system and its failure mechanisms. The cumulative effect of the subelements deterioration decreases the gearbox performance by over 35% within the first 2 years of operation.

AB To improve ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) system efficiency, four systems utilizing the waste heat recovery from offshore oil and gas platform are proposed, including flue gas boosting OTEC (system I), production water boosting surface seawater OTEC (system II), production water boosting working medium OTEC (system III), and production water boosting vapor OTEC (system IV). The system thermodynamic performance are investigated. The results show that system IV has larger power generation (Wnet), thermal efficiency (eta th) and exergy efficiency (eta ex) than others. Compared with single OTEC system, for system IV, Wnet, eta th and eta ex are increased by 1569.13 %, 70.35 % and 138.26 %, respectively. For system IV, with the increase of flue gas waste heat quantity from 2000 to 4000 kW, Wnet, eta th and eta ex are increased by 562 %, 390 % and 181 % respectively; with the increase of production water waste heat quantity from 0 to 100 kW, Wnet, eta th and eta ex are 12.59 %, 5.73 % and 2.86 % respectively. Wnet rises first and then decreases with the increase of evaporation pressure (Peva) or base fluid concentration (xb), presenting an optimal Peva of 1.5 MPa and xb of 0.82 corresponding to the maximum Wnet; Wnet decreases with the increase of condensation temperature.

AB Ocean is full of low-frequency, irregular, and widely distributed wave energy, which is suitable as the energy source for maritime Internet of Things (IoTs). Utilizing triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) to harvest ocean wave energy and power sensors is proven to be an effective scheme. However, in random ocean waves, the irregular electrical energy output by general TENGs restricts the applications. At present, achieving regularized water wave energy harvesting relies on rather complex mechanical structure designs, which is not conducive to industrialization. In this work, we proposed a novel mechanical controlled TENG (MC-TENG) with a simple controlled switch to realize the regularization function. The structural parameters of the MC-TENG are optimized, and the optimal output voltage, output current, and transferred charge respectively reach 1684.2 V, 85.4 mu A, and 389.9 nC, generating a peak power density of 38.46 W<middle dot>m-3<middle dot>Hz-1. Under real water wave environment, the output of the MC-TENG is regularized and keeps stable regardless of any wave conditions. Moreover, the potential applications of the MC-TENG are demonstrated in powering environmental temperature, humidity, and wind speed sensors. This work renders a simple approach to achieve effective regularized ocean wave energy harvesting, promoting the TENG industrialization toward practical application of maritime IoTs.

AB One of the main solutions to climate change is to harness energy from renewable and clean resources. A novel ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) system is proposed for the production of methanol; cooling and power is developed and energetically analyzed. In this proposed trigeneration system, a two-stage Rankine cycle that operates on the inherent temperature difference along the depth of the ocean is used for power production, along with an electrolytic cation exchange membrane (ECEM) reactor for carbon dioxide and hydrogen production to feed the methanol production system. The carbon dioxide is sourced from the deep cold seawater, where the concentrations are found to be the highest. The proposed system performance is modeled and simulated on the Aspen Plus, where the performance of the proposed system is assessed under various operating conditions. The results of this study shows that the maximum net power output of the cycle is found to be 51.5 GW, with a fixed rate of district cooling of 69.0 GW. The maximum methanol production rate was found to be 1.36 kg/s at the power input of 51.5 GW. The system is tested under three different operation cases, to fully assess its viability. It should be noted that in all three cases district cooling is included as a product of the system. Case 1: ECEM reactor operates at its current efficiency with fuel production, Case 2: ECEM reactor operates at proton exchange membrane (PEM) efficiency, and Case 3: Only power was produced with no fuel. The maximum overall energy efficiency of the cycle was found to be 8.0, 8.6, and 7.3% for Cases 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

AB Multi-generation systems based on renewable emerge as promising avenues to promote sustainability for the energy sector. This study introduces a novel concept: an Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion plant assisted by solar energy for both power and cold generation. Power generation is accomplished via an Organic Rankine cycle, while refrigeration needs are met through a vapor compression cycle. Employing Aspen Hysys for simulation, a comprehensive thermodynamic performance evaluation was conducted with extensive sensitivity analyses. Specifically, the effect of various parameters on energy, exergy and economic performance, including working fluids (R114, R134a, R600, and R600a), boiler outlet temperatures, and pressure ratios was investigated. Notably, pressure ratio was found to be the most critical design parameter significantly influencing both net work generated and exergy efficiency. R600 demonstrated the highest energy and exergy performances, with net work generation reaching 20.732 kW and exergy efficiency peaking at 77.07 % for R600a. Furthermore, R600 exhibited the highest COP of 5.24 in refrigeration. In terms of total costs, solar collectors accounted for a substantial portion, constituting 79.7 % of the total costs when using R134a as a working fluid. To optimize the system's performance, a multi-objective optimization was conducted, providing valuable insights into the integration of solar-assisted OTEC plants. This study not only showcases the potential of combining solar energy with OTEC technology but also underscores the critical design and economic considerations necessary for advancing these sustainable energy solutions.

AB This paper introduces a hybrid ocean wave-current energy converter (HWCEC) that harvests energy from ocean waves and current simultaneously with a single power takeoff. The wave energy is extracted through relative heaving motion between a floating buoy and a submerged second body, while the current energy is extracted using a marine current turbine. Energy from both sources is integrated by a hybrid power takeoff whose concept is based on a mechanical motion rectifier. The hybrid power takeoff with two one-way clutches converts bidirectional, up-and-down motion from the waves into unidirectional rotation of the generator. Meanwhile a third one-way clutch couples the turbine with the same generator. The wave and current can simultaneously or separately drive the same generator through different engagement and disengagement statuses of the one-way clutches. Time-domain simulation is conducted with hydrodynamic coefficients obtained from computational fluid dynamics analysis and the boundary element method. Tank tests were conducted for an HWCEC under a coexisting wave and current inputs. For comparison, separate baseline tests of a turbine and a two-body point absorber, each acting in isolation, are conducted. Experimental results validate the dynamic modeling and show that an HWCEC can increase the output power with a range between 24 and 89% over either current turbine and wave energy converter acting individually, and it can reduce by up to 70% the peak-to-average power ratio compared with the wave energy converter on the tested conditions.

AB The Ocean Predictability Experiment for Marine environment (OPEM), operated by the Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology, provides weekly predictions of ocean conditions as part of the Korea Operational Oceanographic System project. Since March 2017, it has produced three-dimensional analysis fields and 10-day prediction data for the western North Pacific. The OPEM utilizes a data assimilation process based on a highly cost-effective scheme, ensemble optimal interpolation, to integrate ocean observations. Three-dimensional ocean analysis fields from the OPEM were validated using mean biases and root-mean-square differences of ocean temperature, salinity, sea surface height, along with mean and eddy kinetic energies and volume transports. The validation results indicated that the OPEM was comparable to other high-resolution reanalysis products for ocean temperature, salinity, and ocean circulation, though it showed less accuracy in the complex dynamics of the Kuroshio Extension region. The OPEM accurately reproduced the subsurface layer ocean temperature and the surface salinity in the marginal seas around Korea; this was possibly attributed to the local implementation of the OPEM, including the adjustment of the Changjiang freshwater discharge to 2 psu. In addition to validation, the 10-day prediction performance of the OPEM was assessed using case studies. The assessment revealed that the OPEM could simulate the intense air-sea interaction caused by Typhoon Hinnamnor in 2022 for at least three days in advance, while the upwelling driven by coastal winds was predictable more than four days ahead. The assessment results highlight the critical importance of accurate atmospheric forecasts in improving ocean prediction accuracy.

AB The deep-seabed mining system for mining resources consists of a mining vessel, lifting riser, lifting pump, buffer system, flexible riser, and mining robot. Because this system is exposed to extreme environments such as fluid resistance, high water pressure, and deep water, a considerable amount of time and cost is consumed in the design and test evaluation of equipment. To tackle these problems, the deep-seabed mining system in an extreme environment requires simulation-based technology. In particular, due to the large movement caused by marine energy, vibration caused by the operation of the mechanical system, and driving resistance of mining robot by the subsea soft soil, it is very important in the mining system design to analyze the dynamic effects of the various elements that constitute the deep-seabed mining system in a single integrated environment. This paper introduces the development of an integrated dynamic simulation method for deep-seabed mining systems and discusses the results.

AB With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, sensors have become the most important nodes for information exchange in the IoT. However, ensuring stable power supply and network communication of a plethora of distributed sensing nodes has become the key technical bottleneck that restricts the development of marine IoT. Herein, a self-adaptive gyroscope-structured hybrid triboelectric-electromagnetic nanogenerator (SAG-HTENG) is designed for omnidirectional wave energy harvesting. Through seamlessly integrating an electromagnetic generator (EMG) and triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) modules into one device, the wave energy conversion efficiency can be significantly enhanced. Furthermore, through incorporating ferromagnetic electrode, remarkable peak power density of 29.92 W m-3 Hz-1 of the TENG module and 402.08 W m-3 Hz-1 of the EMG module can be achieved, respectively. Meanwhile, the TENG module exhibited superior working stability and applicability for harvesting low-frequency wave energy in a water tank field test compared to the EMG module. Leveraging the IoT platform, a self-powered real-time ocean currents monitoring buoy system (OCMBS) is constructed of determining the wave direction and current type. This work offers a novel energy solution for the distributed sensing nodes toward future smart marine IoT.

AB This paper studies a self-reactive ocean wave energy converter (WEC) where energy is absorbed through the relative motion between a floating buoy on the ocean surface and a submerged body. Two types of direct-drive power take off (PTO) systems are examined. One adopts a ball screw system in inverse driving mode with mechanical motion rectifier (MMR) that converts the oscillating bi-directional input heave motion into unidirectional rotation to drive an electromagnetic generator, and another one uses a ball screw system to directly drive the generator (called non-MMR). Dynamic models for both types of PTOs are established and integrated with the overall WEC system model in both the time and frequency domains. Numerical simulation is used to investigate the dynamic performance of both PTOs. The influences of the PTO inerter, which is from the rotational inertia of the flywheel and generator, and the WEC drag damping coefficient are discussed and explored. The analytical closed-form solution for the optimum condition of the non-MMR system is derived based on the criterion of maximum power absorption, and numerical simulation yields the optimum condition for the MMR system. The results under regular and irregular waves show that the PTO inerter in the MMR system can improve the power absorption for small wave periods and maintain the same performance for large wave periods. The PTO inerter in the non-MMR system shifts the peak frequency. The WEC drag damping negatively influences the power absorption in both PTO systems, especially at large wave periods.

AB Ocean renewable energy is a promising inexhaustible source of renewable energy, with an estimated harnessing potential of approximately 337 GW worldwide, which could re-shape the power generation mix. As with other sources of renewables, however, wave energy has an intermittent and irregular nature, which is a major concern for power system stability. Consequently, in order to integrate wave energy into power grids, it must be forecasted. This paper proposes using optimised deep learning neural networks to forecast the wave energy flux, and other wave parameters. In particular, we use moth-flame optimisation as the central decision-making unit to configure the deep neural network structure and the proper input data selection. Besides, the moth-flame optimisation algorithm was modified to improve its search space mechanisms. The forecasting skills are assessed using 13 datasets from locations across the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, and the Gulf of Mexico. The proposed optimised deep neural network performs well at all the sites, especially over short-term horizons, where it outperforms statistical and physics-based approaches.

AB Effects of water mass imbalance and hydrometeor transport on the enthalpy flux and water phase on diabatic heating rate in computing the regional energy and water budget of the atmosphere over ocean are investigated. Equations of energy and water budget of the atmospheric column that explicitly consider the velocity of liquid and ice cloud particles, and rain and snow are formulated by separating water variables from dry air. Differences of energy budget equations formulated in this study from those used in earlier studies are that 1) diabatic heating rate depends on water phase, 2) diabatic heating due to net condensation of nonprecipitating hydrometeors is included, and 3) hydrometeors can be advected with a different velocity from the dry-air velocity. Convergence of water vapor associated with phase change and horizontal transport of hydrometeors is to increase diabatic heating in the atmospheric column where hydrometeors are formed and exported and to reduce energy where hydrometeors are imported and evaporated. The process can improve the regional energy and water mass balance when energy data products are integrated. Effects of enthalpy transport associated with water mass transport through the surface are cooling to the atmosphere and warming to the ocean when the enthalpy is averaged over the global ocean. There is no net effect to the atmosphere and ocean columns combined. While precipitation phase changes the regional diabatic heating rate up to 15 W m(-2), the dependence of the global mean value on the temperature threshold of melting snow to form rain is less than 1 W m(-2).

AB Mesoscale eddies are ubiquitous in the world ocean and are a key factor in maintaining the global oceanic energy balance. Geophysical turbulence theory predicts that the eddy length scale should increase to Rhines scale as it inherits the inverse energy cascade from smaller scales that help to stabilize the ocean circulation system. However, satellite-observed mesoscale eddies are much smaller than predicted, which indicates that unclear forward energy cascades prevail in their life cycles. In this study, we explore the role of finite rough topography in modulating eddy kinetic energy and horizontal length scales by using a series of submesoscale resolving numerical simulations with parameters typical of the Drake Passage. Our results show that, when compared with those generated over a flat bottom, the presence of rough topography can substantially reduce the horizontal length scales of eddies by approximately 60%-70%, even in upper layers 2-3 km above the bottom. Rough topography also consumes significant amounts of eddy kinetic energy, as the volume-mean eddy kinetic energy over a rough bottom decreases by about 70%-80% when compared with that over a flat bottom. By using a dynamics-based decomposition method, we subtracted the submesoscale motions from total flow and found that, in addition to energetic internal lee waves, deep-ocean submesoscale processes (integrated over the bottommost 1 km) contributed roughly 22% of the total viscosity dissipation across the whole research domain over a rough bottom. Therefore, this study indicates that the role of deep-ocean submesoscale motions in the energy cascade and abyssal mixing should be considered in ocean model parameterizations in the future.

AB An offshore multipurpose floating platform (MPFP) combines different marine technologies to serve industry needs using one infrastructure; the aim of an MPFP is enlarging the synthesis benefits and reducing the negative impacts. Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) in particular has attracted significant attention for its great potential and low environmental risk. This research demonstrates the system design of a conceptual MPFP in the South China Sea, evaluating its economic and environmental sustainability using an inclusive index. The system is based on a modular floating structure with a designed lifetime of 50 years. Tuna aquaculture, microalgae cultivation and processing, and the OTEC energy infrastructure are integrated to increase the profitability of the applications. We adopted a high-yield photobioreactor microalgae cultivation system and a low-cost barge-type floating structure combined with a semisubmergible to reduce the required area and cost of the floating structure and improve the sustainability of the system. The inclusive impact index "Triple-I-light (IIIlight)" was calculated to evaluate the environmental sustainability and economic feasibility of the floating system. The result shows that the new system becomes environmentally neutral (EF = BC) at a lifetime of 11.5 years, showing sustainability (IIIlight & LE; 0) at a lifetime of 20 years. The proposed system can produce fish with no external energy or feed supply. An autonomous system, such as the one proposed here, is considered very effective when it comes to utilizing the ocean and contributing to a sustainable society.

AB This research introduces an integrated ocean thermal energy conversion water and power cogeneration system (OTEC-WPCS), combining a Zeotropic Rankine Cycle (ZRC) with Direct Contact Membrane Distillation (DCMD) for efficient power and water production. The hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs), chosen for their zero ozone depletion potential (ODP) and extremely low global warming potential (GWP), are used as working fluid components in the ZRC. Additionally, DCMD is implemented for freshwater generation. A mathematical model is established, incorporating both thermodynamic and CFD simulations. The goal is to identify optimal operating conditions that maximize the output of the system. By coupling DCMD and ZRC in series, the system's efficiency reaches 8.92 %, an improvement of 5.71 % compared to a standalone ZRC system. This configuration allows for more efficient use of surface seawater heat compared to an ammonia-based Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC)-DCMD system. The enhancements include an increase in power and water production per unit mass flow of surface seawater by 0.55 kW/(kg & sdot;s) and 30 %, respectively. Over 60 % of the system's exergy destruction occurs in the DCMD modules and evaporator, while nearly 80 % of the capital cost is associated with the evaporator, condenser, and DCMD heat exchanger. Enhancing the DCMD module structure and heat exchanger can improve both energy and exergy efficiency, and economic feasibility.

AB It is of great significance and development potential to make full use of ocean thermal energy and seawater resources to solve the problem of energy and fresh water supply in tropical coastal areas. In the present article, an innovative ammonia-water (NH3-H2O) based combined cooling, desalination and power (CCDP) system is proposed, consisting of Kalina cycle-based ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), ejector refrigeration cycle (ERC) and spray flash evaporation (SFE) desalination unit. An ejector is introduced for coupling the Kalina cycle and ERC, which creates a larger pressure difference across the turbine in favor of higher power output. Besides, a multi-stage SFE desalination system is integrated into the proposed system for making full use of seawater resources and providing fresh water output. Mathematical model is established for simulating steady operation of the proposed system, and parametric analysis is performed to determine the influences of operational parameters including vapor generation pressure and temperature, ammonia concentration of basic solution and condensation pressure on the system thermodynamic and exergoeconomic performances. Results show that by comparison with the stand-alone Kalina cycle and the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) based multi-generation system, the proposed CCDP system is more advantageous with regard to the effective efficiency, exergy efficiency and net power output. Over 70% of the total exergy destruction occurs in the three components of SFE, condenser and turbine. The improvement of both effective efficiency and exergy efficiency can be accomplished by reducing the condensation pressure and raising the basic ammonia concentration, while not greatly affected by vapor generation temperature.

AB Underwater vehicles are generally supplemented and driven by ocean thermal engine systems (OTES), leveraging the large thermal-energy reserves via solid-liquid phase change materials (PCMs). However, the low thermal conductivity and high-pressure melting point migration of PCMs severely limit their energy-storage performance. In this study, alkane binary mixture PCMs and enhanced heat transfer structures were integrated into the OTES to increase the energy storage power. The melting point of pure n-hexadecane was reduced using a 5% mass fraction of n-octane. The density and melting interval of an alkane binary mixture PCM at different pressures were studied using molecular dynamics simulations. An OTES coupling model based on the enhanced heattransfer theory of metal foams was developed. The minimum relative error in the model prediction of melting time was 1.13%. The effects of different precharge pressures, nominal volumes, and energy-storage strategies of the accumulator on the energy-storage process were investigated. The results indicate that a large nominal volume, precharge pressure, and energy-storage interval are beneficial for improving the energy storage power. For 5 L accumulator, the maximum power for single energy-storage strategy is 13.92 W, while multiple energystorage strategy improves by 41.52% to 19.7 W.

AB The study of energy flows in the Earth system is essential for understanding current climate change. To understand how energy is accumulating and being distributed within the climate system, an updated reconstruction of energy fluxes at the top of atmosphere, surface and within the atmosphere derived from observations is presented. New satellite and ocean data are combined with an improved methodology to quantify recent variability in meridional and ocean to land heat transports since 1985. A global top of atmosphere net imbalance is found to increase from 0.10 +/- 0.61 W m(-2)over 1985-1999 to 0.62 +/- 0.1 W m(-2)over 2000-2016, and the uncertainty of +/- 0.61 W m(-2)is related to the Argo ocean heat content changes (+/- 0.1 W m(-2)) and an additional uncertainty applying prior to 2000 relating to homogeneity adjustments. The net top of atmosphere radiative flux imbalance is dominated by the southern hemisphere (0.36 +/- 0.04 PW, about 1.41 +/- 0.16 W m(-2)) with an even larger surface net flux into the southern hemisphere ocean (0.79 +/- 0.16 PW, about 3.1 +/- 0.6 W m(-2)) over 2006-2013. In the northern hemisphere the surface net flux is of opposite sign and directed from the ocean toward the atmosphere (0.44 +/- 0.16 PW, about 1.7 +/- 0.6 W m(-2)). The sea ice melting and freezing are accounted for in the estimation of surface heat flux into the ocean. The northward oceanic heat transports are inferred from the derived surface fluxes and estimates of ocean heat accumulation. The derived cross-equatorial oceanic heat transport of 0.50 PW is higher than most previous studies, and the derived mean meridional transport of 1.23 PW at 26 degrees N is very close to 1.22 PW from RAPID observation. The surface flux contribution dominates the magnitude of the oceanic transport, but the integrated ocean heat storage controls the interannual variability. Poleward heat transport by the atmosphere at 30 degrees N is found to increase after 2000 (0.17 PW decade(-1)). The multiannual mean (2006-2013) transport of energy by the atmosphere from ocean to land is estimated as 2.65 PW, and is closely related to the ENSO variability.

AB Almost all current climate models simplify the ocean surface albedo (OSA) by assuming the reflected solar energy without the ocean interior contribution. In this study, an improved ocean surface albedo scheme is incorporated into the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) to assess the sensitivity of Arctic surface temperature to including ocean interior reflectance to the OSA. Fully coupled CESM2 simulations with and without ocean interior reflectance are subsequently performed, we focus on the analysis of Arctic surface temperature responses. Incorporating ocean interior reflectance increases absorbed solar radiation and warms the ocean, enhancing seasonal heat storage and release across the Arctic Ocean, and increasing sea ice reduction and positive climate feedbacks that elevates Arctic surface temperature. Seasonal variations in air-surface temperature differences induce changes in turbulent heat flux patterns, concurrently modifying dynamic advection and moisture processes that affect boundary layer humidity and low clouds, especially in winter. Based on partitioning physical processes in the thermodynamic energy equation, surface air warming is induced primarily through positive heating anomalies of vertical advection, latent heat release, and longwave radiative forcing. Through an examination of the surface energy budget, skin temperature warming is driven predominantly by increased downward longwave radiation, positive surface albedo feedback in summer, and increased conductive heat transport from the ocean particularly in winter. Significant effects of ocean interior reflectance on the Arctic Ocean, including sea surface warming and sea ice reduction, justify the importance of ocean interior reflectance in climate models for better understanding of ongoing Arctic climate changes.
   The penetrated sunlight across the ocean surface is attenuated through the light absorption and scattering processes associated with oceanic optical constituents. The ocean attenuation of sunlight not only modifies the amount of solar energy reflected back to the atmosphere but also warms the seawater. Many climate models neglect the contribution of ocean interior reflectance to the ocean surface albedo (OSA) and hence simulate less accurate net heat flux through the air-sea interface. In this study, sensitivity simulations were performed with and without ocean interior reflectance in the OSA calculation, respectively. When ocean interior reflectance is included, the Arctic surface shows warmings in both summer and winter, and the warming is stronger in winter, due to complex feedback mechanisms in the fully coupled model. The warmer Arctic surface is predominantly caused by changes in near-surface vertical air motion, latent heat released during cloud formation, longwave radiative energy budget, and conductive heat transport from the ocean especially in winter. The changes in the drivers are related to seasonal variations in air-surface temperature differences and heat storage-release of the Arctic Ocean. To get a better understanding of climate responses associated with including ocean interior reflectance to the OSA, further investigations are necessary.
   Arctic surface temperature changes are simulated to better understand the implication of the ocean interior reflectance in climate modelSimulation-based increase in Arctic surface temperature is attributed to complex feedbacks inherent in the fully coupled modelClimate responses due to integrating ocean interior reflectance in the ocean surface albedo need more attention in earth system modeling

AB Wind power input to near-inertial motions is an important energy source for generating diapycnal mixing in the ocean. However, the distribution and long-term trend of this input over the Southern Ocean have yet to be quantified. In this study, we investigate the near-inertial wind power input (WPIi) to the Southern Ocean using a global eddy-permitting coupled ocean-sea ice model forced by a high-resolution atmospheric reanalysis product. Our results reveal a zonally asymmetric distribution of WPIi in the Southern Ocean, with the strongest input in the South Indian Ocean and the weakest in the South Pacific. The integrated WPIi between 30 & DEG;S and 60 & DEG;S exhibits a significant positive trend over the past four decades due to the intensification of mesoscale weather systems. The surface mixed-layer depth is found to modulate the spatial pattern and trend of WPIi by altering the surface near-inertial currents.
   Wind fluctuations can excite surface ocean currents that oscillate at frequencies close to the inertial frequency. These near-inertial motions play an important role in generating turbulent mixing in the ocean. However, the distribution and long-term trend of wind power input to near-inertial motions in the Southern Ocean remains unquantified. In this study, we investigate this wind power input using a global ocean circulation model driven by a high-resolution atmospheric reanalysis data set. Our results reveal a pronounced zonal asymmetry in the distribution of near-inertial wind power input in the Southern Ocean. Furthermore, this power input has increased significantly over the past four decades due to the intensification of mesoscale weather systems. Results from this study have important implications for understanding Southern Ocean mixing and circulation.

AB The lack of high efficient, predictable, and reliable power take-off (PTO) systems limits developments of ocean wave energy technology. In this paper, a two-body self-reacting wave energy converter (WEC) with a novel PTO is designed, modelled and implemented for efficiency enhancement. A novel mechanical motion rectifier (MMR) using a ball screw mechanism and an enclosed gear set is integrated to improve the energy harvesting efficiency and reliability by rectifying the oscillatory wave motion into unidirectional rotation of the generator. Detailed design and dynamic modelling for the proposed WEC are presented. A prototype of the PTO is tested in a dry lab to characterize and refine the dynamic modelling. The characterized PTO model is combined with the WEC model to create an overall system model. A water tank test is conducted to verify the overall system dynamics, which proves the accuracy of the model and shows the advantages of the proposed WEC on efficiency and predictability. Following the method of how the WEC system is characterized, performance prediction of the proposed WEC with MMR PTO can be achieved with high accuracy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ocean wave energy is a highly promising renewable energy source that plays a significant role in advancing sustainable development. However, the ultra-low-frequency and random characteristics of ocean waves pose significant challenges to efficient and high-power energy harvesting. This paper introduces an innovative MagBoost mechanism that ingeniously leverages sudden magnetic-torque variation in orthogonal magnetic fields to convert ultra-low excitation below 1 Hz into high-frequency oscillations exceeding 50 Hz in the power-magnet without direct contact. The energy conversion efficiency can be as high as 89.3 %. By integrating four Mag-Boost units into a circular array, this study presents a high-power wave energy harvester with ultra-low-frequency response capabilities. At a frequency of 1 Hz and an inclination angle of 25 degrees, the harvester achieved a high output performance with a power of 1.79 W and a power density of 1.88 kW/m3, which is an order of magnitude higher than previously reported results. During offshore tests in the Yellow Sea, the wave energy harvester reached a peak open-circuit voltage of 10 V, providing a stable power supply for wireless temperature and humidity sensors. Furthermore, the Mag-Boost mechanism also demonstrates considerable potential for harvesting other forms of low-frequency environmental energy, including wind, vibration, and human kinetic energy.

TI Deep reinforcement learning for artificial upwelling energy management
SO OCEAN ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE Artificial upwelling; Energy management; Deep reinforcement learning;
   Carbon sequestration
AB The potential of artificial upwelling in stimulating seaweed growth, consequently enhancing ocean carbon sequestration has been gaining increasing attention in recent years. This has led to the development of the first solar -powered and air -lifted artificial upwelling system (AUS) in China. However, effective scheduling of the air injection system and energy storage system in dynamic marine environments remains a crucial challenge in the operation of the AUS, as it holds the potential to significantly improve system performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel energy management approach that utilizes the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to determine the optimal operational parameters of the AUS at each time interval. Specifically, we formulate the energy optimization problem as a Markov decision process and integrate the quantile network in distributional reinforcement learning with the deep dueling network to solve the problem. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate its superior effectiveness over traditional rule -based approaches and other DRL algorithms in enhancing energy utilization while ensuring the secure and reliable operation of the AUS. Our findings suggest that a DRL-based approach offers a promising way to provide valuable guides for the operation of the AUS and enhance the sustainability of seaweed cultivation and carbon sequestration in the ocean.

AB Climate model simulations of changes to Earth's energy budget are fundamental to improve understanding of both historical and future climate change. However, coupled models are prone to "drift" (i.e., they contain spurious unforced trends in state variables) due to incomplete spinup or nonclosure of the energy budget. This work assesses the globally integrated energy budgets of 25 models in phase 5 of CMIP (CMIP5). It is shown that for many of the models there is a significant disagreement between ocean heat content changes and net top-of-atmosphere radiation. The disagreement is largely time-constant and independent of forcing scenario. Furthermore, most of the nonconservation seems to occur as a result of energy leaks external to the ocean model realm. After drift correction, the time-varying energy budget is consistent at decadal time scales, and model responses to climate forcing are not sensitive to the magnitude of their drift. This demonstrates that, although drift terms can be significant, model output can be corrected post hoc without biasing results.

AB An efficient control method is crucial for the safe and reliable operation of compression-assisted absorption refrigeration using ocean thermal energy. In this study, a dynamic model of 10 kW compression-assisted absorption refrigeration system is developed, and four integrated control strategies containing two cooling-capacity control approaches (Single input control and Cooperation control) and two temperature glide control approaches (Valve-based control and Compressor-based control) are proposed to control thermodynamic process. The proposed control strategies are evaluated in terms of both control and refrigeration performances. The results indicate that the refrigeration system can operate with stability at 50 % cooling load under the proposed control strategies. Moreover, the cooperative control of the flow rates for both warm-seawater and concentrated solution can significantly speed up cooling-capacity regulation. The rotational speed of compressor is a more suitable manipulated variable for regulating the evaporator temperature glide. The equivalent COP for the compressorbased control strategies is greater than 0.12 at 50 % cooling load, while the equivalent COP for the valvebased control strategies is only 0.064.

AB To overcome the limited efficiency of ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), particularly in the mid-latitudes, combined OTEC (C-OTEC) could use power extracted from the latent heat of a power plant condenser. Past research in South Korea has demonstrated the feasibility of a 10 kW C-OTEC system using R134a as a working fluid. As the next phase, a 200 kW C-OTEC demonstration facility with a thermal efficiency of greater than 3% is proposed. This paper presents the engineering design process for kW-scale C-OTEC within a 100 MW-scale thermal power plant. The design process is divided into two stages. First, to predict patterns in steam flow to a connected external evaporator with a porous medium, computational fluid dynamics are calculated. The results show a conservative margin suitable for the conceptual design. Second, an iterative heat balance simulation method simultaneously evaluates the heat balance analysis of the C-OTEC design and the thermal impact of the existing power plant. The design stages are then integrated in terms of heat transference capacity.

AB While offshore wind energy uptake is growing steadily, offshore wave energy remains largely untapped, despite having significant potential globally. The high cost and complexity of wave energy conversion systems are the main challenges to their commercial development globally, while they can be offset if they are integrated into the well-developed offshore structure of wind turbines. Since the source of the wave energy is associated with wind resources, these two ocean renewable resources have strong synergies that are yet to be combined effectively. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the idea of introducing wave energy converters into the offshore wind system as a hybrid system with a specific focus on wave energy converter (WEC) systems from their power characteristic perspective. In this paper, wave power fluctuations characteristics have been analysed and compared with wind power and two mechanical energy storage strategies, added inertia and gas accumulators, are investigated at the power take-off (PTO) system level on a typical point absorbed WEC. A sensitivity study of the impact of various mechanical storage systems on WEC performance was conducted under a set of real wave data. In addition, the significance of mechanical storage systems at the WEC PTO level in a DC-linked hybrid system is discussed along with enabling a better understanding of a future combined system. The results indicate that both mechanical storage options can effectively enhance energy production, reduce the power variations in the WEC system, and lead to the feasibility of integrating wave energy with the well-known offshore wind energy turbine system.

AB Long-term energy supplies hinder the application of the low-power unmanned ocean devices to the deep sea. Ocean wave energy is a renewable resource with amount stores of enormous and high density. The wave energy converter (WEC) could be miniaturized so that it can be integrated into the devices to make up the power module. In this paper, a small novel heaving point absorber of energy supply for low-power unmanned ocean devices is developed based on the counter-rotating self-adaptive mechanism. The floating body as an important part of the heaving point absorber, the geometric parameters is optimized to increase the efficiency of power production. Through constructing the constitutive relation between the geometric parameters, the wave force, the motion displacement, the motion velocity, and the capture width ratio of the floating body, the energy efficiency characteristics of the multi-type floating bodies are calculated, and the optimal shape is selected. On the other hand, in the calculation process of the wave force, the Froude-Krylov method is an effective method to accurately calculate the wave excitation force. Meanwhile, nonlinear static and dynamic Froude-Krylov force effectively overcomes the inaccuracy of the linear models and reduces the time consumed to simulate. Finally, the wave force, heaving velocity, heaving displacement, and capture width ratio of the three floating bodies are compared and analyzed, and the results show that the cylindrical floater that is vertically placed on the wave surface is more suitable for the novel heaving wave energy point absorber.

AB One of the critical issues for the conventional TENGs for applications in biomechanical and blue energy harvesting is to develop adaptive, simple-structured, high performance but low-cost TENGs for the complex excitation conditions. To solve this problem, we propose an origami-inspired TENG integrated with folded thin film electret, which can be facilely formed from two pieces of liquid crystal polymer (LCP) strips through high degrees of paper folding. It has been proved efficient for harvesting energy from both sinusoidal vibrations and impulse excitations which are universally existed in the ambient environment. Double-side corona discharging process is employed to maximize the charge density generated by the electret thin films. Attributing to the excellent elastic property of self-rebounding spring structures based on the origami design, the flexible TENGs can be readily integrated into smart shoes, floors, watches and clothes for wearable and energy harvesting applications. Triggered by impulse excitation of gentle finger tapping, instantaneous open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current of 1000 V and 110 mu A, respectively, have been obtained with a remarkable peak power density of 0.67 mW/cm(3) (or 1.2 mW/g). A spherical floating buoy generator integrating multiple origami TENGs is further developed to harvest ocean wave energy at various frequencies and amplitudes as well as in arbitrary directions. The outcomes of this work offer new insights of realizing single structured TENG designs for multifunctional applications.

AB Floating Photovoltaic (FPV) systems are emerging as a new type of ocean renewable energy, offering advantages such as avoiding land use and promoting power generation efficiency. Providing significant cost-effectiveness for manufacturing, transportation, and installation, FPV systems with modular floating platforms exhibit the potential to replace the conventional large steel-frame one. However, the performance of such multi-floating body structures under wave conditions remain underexplored. In this paper, based on potential flow theory, the motion characteristics and power performance of the proposed FPV array connected by the articulated system are evaluated. The results indicate that the FPV arrays with shorter floating structures exhibit greater pitch motion, especially when the wave condition matches the pitch resonance. For multi-float cases, the articulated system, optimized with appropriate parameters, demonstrates efficacy as attenuators. Additionally, the proposed FPV array has great potential to serve as an infrastructure for integrating solar and wave energy. For a selected offshore site, potential wave energy output from motion attenuators between FPV floaters is assessed together with solar energy output. Overall, this study serves as a valuable reference for the design and optimization of the multi-modules FPV and advances the research on combined solar and wave energy utilization on floating structures.

AB Based on a novel approach, present-day and future spectral wind-wave conditions in a high-emission scenario from a seven-member wave climate projection ensemble are compared. The spectral analysis at the selected locations aids in understanding the propagation of swell projected changes from the generation areas across the ocean basins. For example, a projected increase in the energy from Southern Ocean swells can be observed in all ocean basins and both hemispheres, which is especially relevant in the west coast of North America due to the penetration of these swells beyond 30 degrees N. Similarly, a consistent decrease in the energy of large northern Atlantic swells is noted close to the equator. This work provides evidence that assessments based on only integrated wave parameters (e.g., significant wave height and mean wave period) can mask information about the sign, magnitude, and robustness of the actual wave climate changes due to the offset of positive and negative variations within the spectrum, leading to a significant underestimation of the change associated with certain wave systems.

AB This paper proposes a floating energy harvesting platform concept, which integrates multiple point-absorber wave energy converters (WECs) onto a floating semi-submersible platform. The focus is to investigate WEC spacing effects on the dynamic response and energy harvesting performance of the hybrid system. To this end, five energy harvesting models with various WEC spacings are defined. Under average wave height condition, the typical wave periods are considered to analyze the performance variations in these models. Notably, the influence of hydrodynamic interactions is evaluated on the energy absorption. Furthermore, under both average and severe wave conditions, the present study establishes different performance evaluation criteria and conducts comparative analysis across the models. The results indicate that under average wave condition, the optimal energy harvesting model varies depending on the evaluation benchmark. Additionally, under severe wave condition, the model with the smallest WEC spacing demonstrates the best performance. Overall, the present study emphasizes the effects of the hydrodynamic interactions on the performance of the wave-energy integrated system, of which the analytical framework and methods could provide some insights into the design and optimization of other ocean energy systems.

AB Ocean monitoring and forecasting systems combine information from ocean observations and numerical models through advanced data assimilation techniques. They are essential to monitor and report on past, present and future oceanic conditions. However, given the continuous development of oceanic models and data assimilation techniques in addition to the increased diversity of assimilated platforms, it becomes more and more difficult to establish how information from observations is used, and to determine the utility and relevance of a change of the global ocean observing system on ocean analyses. Here, a series of observing system simulation experiments (OSSE), which consist in simulating synthetic observations from a realistic simulation to be subsequently assimilated in an experimental analysis system, was performed. An original multiscale approach is then used to investigate (i) the impact of various observing system components by distinguishing between satellites and in situ (Argo floats and tropical moorings), and (ii) the impact of recommended changes in observing systems, in particular the impact of Argo floats doubling and enhancements of tropical moorings, on the fidelity of ocean analyses. This multiscale approach is key to better understand how observing system components, with their distinct sampling characteristics, help to constrain physical processes. The study demonstrates the ability of the analysis system to represent 40-80% of the temperature variance at mesoscale (20-30% for salinity), and more than 80% for larger scales. Satellite information, mostly through altimetric data, strongly constrains mesoscale variability, while the impact of in situ temperature and salinity profiles are essential to constrain large scale variability. It is also shown that future enhancements of Argo and tropical mooring arrays observations will likely be beneficial to ocean analyses at both intermediate and large scales, with a higher impact for salinity-related quantities. This work provides a better understanding on the respective role of major satellite and in situ observing system components in the integrated ocean observing system.

AB In this study, we consider the origin of the Coriolis-Stokes (CS) force in the wave-averaged momentum and energy equations and make a short analysis of possible energy input to the ocean circulation (i.e., Eulerian mean velocity) from the CS force. Essentially, we find that the CS force appears naturally when considering vertically integrated quantities and that the CS force will not provide any energy input into the system for this case. However, by including the "Hasselmann force", we show some inconsistencies regarding the vertical structure of the CS force in the Eulerian framework and find that there is a distinct vertical structure of the energy input and that the net input strongly depends on whether the wave zone is included in the analysis or not. We therefore question the introduction of the "Hasselmann force" into the system of equations, as the CS force appears naturally in the vertically integrated equations or when Lagrangian vertical coordinates are used.

AB Culturing microalgae in the ocean has potentials that may reduce the production cost and provide an option for an economic biofuel production from microalgae. The ocean holds great potentials for mass microalgal cultivation with its high specific heat, mixing energy from waves, and large cultivable area. Suitable photobioreactors (PBRs) that are capable of integrating marine energy into the culture systems need to be developed for the successful ocean cultivation. In this study, prototype floating PBRs were designed and constructed using transparent low-density polyethylene film for microalgal culture in the ocean. To improve the mixing efficiency, various types of internal partitions were introduced within PBRs. Three different types of internal partitions were evaluated for their effects on the mixing efficiency in terms of mass transfer (K(L)a) and mixing time in the PBRs. The partition type with the best mixing efficiency was selected, and the number of partitions was varied from one to three for investigation of its effect on mixing efficiency. When the number of partitions is increased, mass transfer increased in proportion to the number of partitions. However, mixing time was not directly related to the number of partitions. When a green microalga, Tetraselmis sp. was cultivated using PBRs with the selected partition under semi-continuous mode in the ocean, biomass and fatty acid productivities in the PBRs were increased by up to 50 % and 44 % at high initial cell density, respectively, compared to non-partitioned ones. The results of internally partitioned PBRs demonstrated potentials for culturing microalgae by efficiently utilizing ocean wave energy into culture mixing in the ocean.

AB Fossil fuels cannot provide all the required energy in future due to their exhaustibility. Their utilization also leads to huge environmental problems. Therefore, it is vital to find a new inexhaustible and clean source of energy which could be easily stored and transported. Hydrogen produced by renewable energy sources has all the above mentioned advantages. There are many hydrogen production methods which could be coupled with renewable energy sources. Among them, electrolysis process is the most mature one. In this paper, a review is performed on different methods of coupling electrolyzer systems with different renewable energy sources, including solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, ocean thermal energy conversion system and hydroelectric energy. The focus of this study is on how these systems can be integrated and which one has the highest total efficiency. Finally, cost of hydrogen production by different energy sources is compared.

AB In this paper, a prediction model based on the artificial neural network (ANN) method was constructed, and the thermodynamic performance prediction and optimization were conducted for a system for ocean thermal energy conversion that integrates an air conditioning cycle (OTEC-AC). By employing the variable importance measure (VIM) method, ten key parameters were selected as input parameters, and three output parameters, including system power generation (Wele), cold energy efficiency (eta co), and energy efficiency (eta en) were defined. The accuracies of prediction models constructed by the back propagation neural network (BPNN) and BPNN optimized by the particle swarm optimization algorithm (BPNN-PSO) were compared. Analysis of the thermodynamic characteristics and multi-objective optimization of the system were performed, and performance differences between the experimental data-based and the BPNN-PSO model-based system were compared. Results showed that optimizing the initial weights and thresholds of the model using the PSO algorithm could enhance the model's generalization capability. Multi-objective optimal results based on prediction data were very close to those based on experimental data, with a maximum relative error of 4.4498 %. This study validates the feasibility of using the ANN model for data prediction in OTEC cogeneration systems, which could provide guidelines for the optimal design of related systems.

AB The dramatic reduction of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean will increase human activities in the coming years. This activity will be driven by increased demand for energy and the marine resources of an Arctic Ocean accessible to ships. Oil and gas exploration, fisheries, mineral extraction, marine transportation, research and development, tourism, and search and rescue will increase the pressure on the vulnerable Arctic environment. Technologies that allow synoptic in situ observations year-round are needed to monitor and forecast changes in the Arctic atmosphere-ice-ocean system at daily, seasonal, annual, and decadal scales. These data can inform and enable both sustainable development and enforcement of international Arctic agreements and treaties, while protecting this critical environment. In this paper, we discuss multipurpose acoustic networks, including subsea cable components, in the Arctic. These networks provide communication, power, underwater, and under-ice navigation, passive monitoring of ambient sound (ice, seismic, biologic, and anthropogenic), and acoustic remote sensing (tomography and thermometry), supporting and complementing data collection from platforms, moorings, and vehicles. We support the development and implementation of regional to basin-wide acoustic networks as an integral component of a multidisciplinary in situ Arctic Ocean observatory.

AB The integrated floating energy system (IFES) consisting of wind and tidal/current energy generators is more capable of utilizing energy from the ocean in a relatively lower cost compared to floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs). Apparently, the performance of an IFES is significantly affected by the amount and installation position of the tidal turbines, which is rarely investigated in the state-of-the-art. In order to address the research need, this study aims to examine the complicated interaction effects between the wind and tidal turbines of a 10 MW-class semi-submersible floating wind-current integrated system (IFES) that is composed of the DTU 10 MW wind turbine, OO-Star platform, and indefinite 550 kW tidal turbines. A coupled analysis tool is developed to consider the aero-hydro-servo-elastic coupling effects of the IFES under wind, wave, current loadings. The dynamic responses of the IFES with 0 similar to 3 tidal turbines under different load cases are obtained. The fatigue damage at the tower base of the IFES is subsequently evaluated to illustrate the effect of the tidal turbines. The results indicate that the increase of the number of tidal turbines leads to a relatively smaller platform pitch motion under each of the examined load cases. The presence of the tidal turbines has an insignificant effect on fatigue damage at the tower base, implying that the integration of tidal turbines has no negative effects on the floating platform. The total power of the IFES with three tidal turbines is expected to increase by 9.46% compared to the FOWT. This study has confirmed the benefits of integrating marine energy convertors with a FOWT in enhancing the energy utilization efficiency and system stability.

AB Coastal zone compound flooding (CF) can be caused by the interactive fluvial and oceanic processes, particularly when coastal backwater propagates upstream and interacts with high river discharge. The modeling of CF is limited in existing Earth System Models (ESMs) due to coarse mesh resolutions and one-way coupled river-ocean components. In this study, we present a novel multi-scale coupling framework within the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM), integrating global atmosphere and land with interactively coupled river and ocean models using different meshes with refined resolutions near the coastline. To evaluate this framework, we conducted ensemble simulations of a CF event (Hurricane Irene in 2011) in a Mid-Atlantic estuary. The results demonstrate that the novel E3SM configuration can reasonably reproduce river discharge and sea surface height variations. The two-way river-ocean coupling improves the representation of coastal backwater effects at the terrestrial-aquatic interface that are caused by the combined actions of tide and storm surge during the CF event, thus providing a valuable modeling tool for better understanding the river-estuary-ocean dynamics in extreme events under climate change. Notably, our results show that the most significant CF impacts occur when the highest storm surge generated by a tropical cyclone meets with a moderate river discharge. This study highlights the state-of-the-art advancements developed within E3SM for simulating multi-scale coastal processes.
   Compound flooding (CF) happens when rivers and oceans interact in the coastal zone. There are limitations in current models to accurately simulate these processes because of the insufficient resolutions in the computational meshes and lack of details on how rivers and oceans are connected. This study creates a comprehensive framework for the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) and demonstrates its ability to simulate a specific compound flooding event in a Mid-Atlantic estuary. Our framework combines models of the atmosphere, land, river, and ocean, each with its own level of detail near the coastline to account for their different physical processes. Our results show that the E3SM framework can reproduce the river discharge and sea level variations reasonably well. By simulating the interaction between river and ocean, we can better understand the effects of coastal water on river discharge forced by tides and storm surges during the CF event. Our simulation reveals that CF is most significant when a tropical cyclone produces the highest storm surge but moderate river discharge. This study demonstrates the capability of the E3SM model to accurately simulate the detailed coastal processes.
   An Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) configuration is developed to integrate variable-resolution meshes with component advancements The two-way river-ocean coupling scheme developed in E3SM significantly improves the representation of river-ocean interactions The new coupled E3SM configuration provides insights into the nonlinear interactions between storm surge and river discharge during compound flooding

AB Since wave fluctuates continuously, the forecast of the wave energy is very important for the operation of power systems integrated with large-scale wave energy generation. A combined model of day-ahead wave energy forecast based on improved grey BP neural network (BPNN) and modified ensemble empirical mode decomposition (MEEMD) -autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the wave is decomposed into wind waves and swells by wave theories. Secondly, the correlation between wind wave and wind speed is analyzed with improved grey BPNN, and the average height of wind waves can be forecasted based on the historical wind speed data. Thirdly, the MEEMD-ARIMA model is utilized to forecast the average wave height of swells. Thus, combining the wind wave and the swell, the average wave height of the integrated wave can be obtained. Finally, a conversion model from wave elements to wave energy for Archimedes wave swing (AWS) is introduced. A case study using the measured wind and wave data from a real ocean is illustrated, and the effectiveness of the proposed wave energy forecast model is validated.

AB The ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) is a potential substitute for traditional power plants in tropical islands and coastal regions. However, the OTEC power generation cycle has low thermal efficiency and the integrated utilization is imperative, in which an OTEC coupled with seawater desalination is the most attractive option. Membrane distillation (MD) has distinct advantages making itself a competitive process for seawater desalination, especially the feature that the drained warm seawater from the OTEC power plant can be recycled, improving the integrated output of the OTEC system. In this study, an innovative OTEC system coupling a power generation sub-cycle (PGC) and a water production sub-cycle (WPC) was proposed, composed of the upstream organic Rankine cycle and the downstream membrane distillation modules. The mass, energy and exergy balance of the individual equipment, the sub-cycles and the whole system were performed by constructing the corresponding balance models. The thermal dynamic parameters were calculated, and the performance of power generation and water production was predicted. The results showed that by coupling with the MD desalination, the thermal efficiency of the OTEC system can be greatly improved from 2.19% to 25.38% while the exergy efficiency changed little. For a 100 kW OTEC power generation cycle, the water production rate approached 58.874 t/d. In addition, the economic analysis based on the electricity and water sale was carried out, and the profit can be improved by extra water production, especially in the Hawaii and Rainbow Beach by nearly 20%.

AB The integration of renewable energy sources into offshore oil and gas extraction operations enhances sustainability and operational efficiency. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to system design for energy production on offshore platforms using wind turbines as the primary power source. Our approach focuses on two main components: wind uncertainty analysis and the design of a robust power supply system. We analyze wind uncertainty using metocean data from 23 ocean sites in the United States, including wind speed and direction, calculating key metrics such as mean wind speed, standard deviation, and extreme values for the West Coast, East Coast, and Gulf of Mexico. This analysis provides insights into the uncertainties of wind energy production in offshore environments. Based on the wind analysis, we propose a system that integrates wind turbines with distributed energy storage systems, managed by a centralized control system. Our system design emphasizes minimizing power downtimes, reducing the impact of aleatoric uncertainty in wind patterns, and improving energy stability. This work uniquely emphasizes a zero-emission constraint, eliminating fossil fuel backups. Unlike prior studies, our framework integrates advanced uncertainty management techniques to address wind variability across multiple sites, ensuring energy storage for uninterrupted power under a zero-emission constraint. Simulation results demonstrate a 50% reduction in power downtimes and an 80.88% improvement in energy stability, significantly reducing uncertainty in power supply and advancing the application of renewable energy in offshore oil and gas operations. The code developed for this study is available on GitHub: GitHub Repository.

AB The ocean stores more than 90% of the energy excess associated with anthropogenic climate change. The resulting ocean warming and thermal expansion are leading contributors to global mean sea level (GMSL) rise. Confidence in projections of GMSL rise therefore depends on the ability of climate models to reproduce global mean thermosteric sea level (GMTSL) rise over the twentieth century. This study first compares the GMTSL of the climate models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) to observations over 1961-2005. Although the model ensemble mean is within the uncertainty of observations, the model ensemble exhibits a large spread. The authors then aim to explain the spread in CMIP5 climate model GMTSL over the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. It is shown that the climate models' GMTSL rise depends linearly on the time-integrated radiative forcing F (under continuously increasing radiative forcing). The constant of proportionality expresses the transient thermosteric sea level response of the climate system, and it depends on the fraction of excess heat stored in the ocean, the expansion efficiency of heat, the climate feedback parameter, and the ocean heat uptake efficiency. The across-model spread in explains most (>70%) of the across-model spread in GMTSL rise over the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, while the across-model spread in time-integrated F explains the rest. The time-integrated F explains less variance in the across-model GMTSL rise in twenty-first-century than in twentieth-century simulations, as the spread in F is reduced over the twenty-first century because the anthropogenic aerosol forcing, which is a large source of uncertainty in F, becomes relatively smaller.

AB A modeling system is presented for simulation of multiphysics coastal ocean flows at scales from O (1) m to O (1,000) km, especially for high-fidelity simulation of local, complicated, free-surface phenomena. The system integrates the solver for incompressible flow on unstructured mesh (SIFUM) and the finite volume coastal ocean model (FVCOM) on the basis of domain decomposition. In this system, the former is built on the Navier-Stokes equations and simulates small-scale, fully three-dimensional phenomena in local flows, whereas the latter is based on the geophysical fluid dynamics equations and predicts large-scale, background ocean currents. The integrated SIFUM-FVCOM system is developed from a previous system consisting of a structured-grid model and an unstructured-grid model (Tang et al., J. Comput. Phys. 273, 2014), and it combines two unstructured-grid models and has the capability of dealing with free-surface phenomena and complex geometries in local flows. In the new system, SIFUM and FVCOM are two-way coupled via Schwarz iteration, and they march in time together as a single system. The SIFUM-FVCOM system performs as intended with regard to capturing physical phenomena (e.g., generation of dam-break wave and slashing of water at a structure), converging with grid spacing and time step, and permitting seamless transition of solutions for far and near fields. In addition, its prediction of benchmark flow problems matches well with analytical, computational, and experimental data. The system is able to simultaneously and directly simulate many multiscale, multiphysics, real-world phenomena that could not be handled before. Such capability is illustrated by its application to coastal flooding and the resulting impact on a coastal bridge and a beachfront house.

AB Ocean occupies about 71% of the global surface area and contains 97% of the total water on the earth. Ocean waves are regarded as one of the most promising renewable energy sources, but it is quite difficult to harvest such low-quality and low-frequency energy due to the technology limitations of traditional electromagnetic generators. In this work, a type of arc-shaped triboelectric nanogenerator (AS-TENG) with internal rolling structure is designed to harvest low-frequency water wave energy. The freestanding roller with flexible surfaces can scroll freely with low friction along the arched track under external triggering, generating induced current between the complementary electrodes. The arc-shaped design facilitates the high-density integrating of multiple TENG units and effective packaging for potential large-scope applications. One AS-TENG can deliver an output power density of 5.47 W m(-3) under regular triggering, while a power density of 2.34 W m(-3) is achieved for an AS-TENG array under real water wave triggering of 1.2 Hz. Moreover, through harvesting water wave energy by the AS-TENG array, self-powered temperature sensing and wireless transmission systems have been successfully constructed. This work demonstrates huge application prospects of the AS-TENGs toward large-scale ocean blue energy harvesting and environmental monitoring.

AB The incorporation of energy storage directly into the distribution system of a Navy ship can enable new dynamic high-power loads and improve overall energy efficiency. This article investigates the integration of energy storage onboard an all-electric destroyer by designing a solution for an advanced combination of loads and establishing a procedure for incorporating energy storage directly into the distribution system design. A case study is examined, in which a battery is sized for a defined load and integrated into a ship design with associated peripherals. The selected battery is simulated to verify expected performance. The study investigates a battery-based system that provides peak shaving to assist the traditional generation system in supplying pulsed and stochastic loads, while also enabling single-generator operations. Such an energy storage system provides notable benefits in terms of fuel consumption during normal operations while also guaranteeing a stable and continuous power supply to the mission loads during battle scenarios.

AB This paper presents a new concept for integrating compressed air energy storage (CAES) into spar-type floating wind turbine platforms. A preliminary investigation of the implications of integrating the proposed concept on the design and dynamic characteristics of a 5 MW floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) system is presented. A simplified numerical model for sizing the spar to cater for a given compressed air pressure and energy storage capacity is presented. This is then used in a parametric analysis to establish the relationship between the storage capacity, the spar geometry and the additional mass of the floating configuration to support high air pressures. Numerical simulations for the dynamic response are then performed using the marine engineering software tool ANSYS Aqwi(C) to study the effect of the added steel mass of the spar resulting from CAES integration on the dynamic response characteristics under irregular wave conditions. The results are compared to those derived for a conventional FOWT-spar configuration without an energy storage system. It is shown that it is technically feasible to integrate short-term energy storage capacities on the order of Megawatt-hours. Although integration of CAES in the floating spar results in a significant increase in the weight of the floating structure, it is shown that this also results in a reduction in the motion experienced by the FOWT for the met ocean conditions considered in this study.

ID INFORMATION COLLECTION; COMMUNICATION; INTERNET; IOT
AB The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) plays a key role in maritime monitoring systems, but energy-efficient data-uploading has been a challenging task owing to energy-constrained and expensive facilities, such as buoys and underwater sensors. In this article, we present an energy-efficient data collection scheme for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided ocean monitoring networks (OMNs), where underwater acoustic and aerial radio frequency (RF) links are considered collaboratively. Our goal is to maximize energy efficiency (EE) of the entire OMN by jointly optimizing the transmit power of buoys and sensors, scheduling their transmissions, as well as designing the UAV's trajectory; the objective function is constrained by minimum throughput thresholds, power consumption budgets, and the UAV's kinematic conditions. Furthermore, we introduce a tradeoff between the energy consumption of buoys and sensors to bridge the gap between acoustic and RF links. The formulated problem is decomposed into three subproblems and they are solved alternatively. In each iteration, we leverage Dinkelbach's method and successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to tackle the fractional program (FP) and transform an original subproblem into a convex form, respectively. Extensive simulations confirm the convergence of our proposed scheme, reveal the influence of the tradeoff on EE, and show that our scheme outweighs other benchmarks in different scenarios.

AB Integrating renewable energy sources with aquaculture systems on floating multi-use platforms presents an innovative approach to developing sustainable and resilient offshore infrastructure, utilizing the ocean's considerable potential. From March 2021 to January 2022, a 1:15-scale prototype was tested in Reggio Calabria, Italy, which gave crucial insights into how these structures behave under different wave conditions. This study investigates the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to predict changes in mooring loads, particularly at key points of the structure. By analyzing metocean data, several ANN models and optimization techniques were evaluated to identify the most accurate predictive model. With a Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) of 1.7-4.7%, the results show how ANNs can effectively predict offshore platform dynamics. This research highlights the potential of machine learning in developing and managing sustainable ocean systems, setting the stage for future advancements in data-driven marine resource management.

AB Expansion of oxygen deficient waters (hypoxia) in the northeast Pacific Ocean (NEP) will have marked impacts on marine life. The response of the resident communities will be a function of their ecophysiological constraints in low oxygen, although this remains untested in the NEP due to a lack of integrative studies. Here, we combine in situ surveys and lab-based respirometry experiments were conducted on three indicator species (spot prawn Pandalus platyceros, slender sole Lyopsetta exilis, squat lobster Munida quadrispina) of seasonally hypoxic systems in the NEP to test if metabolic constraints determine distributions and energy sequestration in a hypoxic setting. These experiments were integrated with a global review of critical oxygen levels (O-2(crit); lower threshold of aerobic metabolism) for crustaceans to determine if O-2(crit)-based hypoxia thresholds are different among ocean basins. Our results show that species-specific differences in O-2(crit) and standard metabolic rates (1) determine the lowest environmental oxygen ([O-2](env)) at which in situ populations occur, (2) result in disproportionate shifts in distributions among co-occurring species during summer hypoxia expansion events, and (3) characterize shifts in megafaunal community respiration rates due to marked spatio-temporal variability in [O-2](env). Our results show that O-2(crit)-based hypoxia thresholds are significantly lower in the East Pacific Ocean relative to other major ocean basins, which suggests that the physiological response of local fauna to deoxygenation can be determined by the natural variability and oxygen exposure in a region. In order to establish realistic predictions on the biological consequences of marine deoxygenation, we suggest integrating metabolism-based traits to calculate hypoxia thresholds for marine ecosystems.

AB During the R&D of marine renewable energy converters, scale models are usually used in the early stages of development of marine renewable energy converters. China's National Ocean Integrated Test Site (NOITS) is being developed by the National Ocean Technology Center (NOTC) in Weihai, Shandong Province, to facilitate testing of scaled wave and tidal energy converters in an open sea environment. This research aims to gain a detailed understanding of the wave characteristics and the wave energy resource at this site. A nested modeling system has been implemented using Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) to provide a 10-year high-resolution wave hindcast between 2009 and 2019 with an approximately 60 m resolution covering the test site. Analysis of the spatio-temporal distribution of wave energy resource in NOITS reveals its strong seasonality, with the mean wave power density of >1.5 kW/m during winter and <0.2 kW/m during summer. We also performed a statistical analysis of the high and extreme wave conditions and their occurrence. By applying scaling methods to wave resources, four WECs were selected to demonstrate the testing at different scale ratios in NOITS. The results of this study provide engineering references for the design of scale wave energy converter models which target to perform open sea trials in NOITS.

AB Ocean waves are considered to be one of the most promising renewable energy sources, and harvesting such energy via triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) is an effective strategy toward large-scale blue energy. However, most previous optimization schemes of TENG cannot meet the demands of practical applications. In this work, a new charge excitation circuit (CEC) with advantages of integration, high efficiency, and minimum impedance is developed specially for TENGs to harvest water wave energy. The TENG with the CEC exhibits significantly improved output performance, with a maximum power of 25.8 mW and power density of 49.3 W m(-3), and a 208 times enhanced current of 25.1 mA is achieved. Furthermore, a scheme of integrating TENG network and CECs is proposed for realizing large-scale wave energy harvesting. The charge excitation TENG network is demonstrated to successfully power a digital thermometer and a wireless communication system with mobile phone through transmitting radio frequency (RF) signals for remote environmental monitoring. This study not only offers a strategy to greatly enhance the output performance of TENG networks in water wave energy harvesting, but also provides useful guidance for constructing maritime communication platform based on blue energy toward a maritime internet of things system.

AB The primary goal of the current study is thermodynamic and environmental modeling and multi-objective optimization of a new hybrid energy system. The suggested ocean-based energy conversion system consists of an organic Rankine cycle (ORC), a solar flat plate collector, a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer boosted with thermoelectric generator (TEG) module. Exergy and exergo-environmental as two powerful tools are employed to the precise assessment of the suggested system. To achieve the best performance of the integrated system, multi-criteria optimization with different objective functions is carried out. As the results of the parametric analysis indicate, defined objective goals have an appropriate conflict with changing decision variables, which is necessary in multi-criteria optimization. Four decision variables namely solar flat plate collector area (A(p)), solar radiation intensity (I), collector temperature (T-col), and condenser temperature (T-cond) are chosen as decision variables. In all optimization scenarios, the net output power is common, which is based on the selected optimum points value changing between 201.02 kW and 268.17 kW. Additionally, in various optimization scenarios, the area of solar flat plate collectors tends to get a higher value in the allowable domain. The provided information in multi-objective optimization can provide good insight to engineers and system designers to select the best system configuration.

AB Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is a critical tool in all plans to limit warming to below 1.5 degrees C, but only a few CDR pathways have been incorporated into integrated assessment models that international climate policy deliberations rely on. A more diverse set of CDR approaches could have important benefits and costs for energy-water-land systems. Here we use an integrated assessment model to assess a complete suite of CDR approaches including bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, afforestation, direct air capture with carbon storage, enhanced weathering, biochar and direct ocean capture with carbon storage. CDR provided by each approach spans three orders of magnitude, with deployment and associated impacts varying between regions. Total removals reach approximately 10 GtCO(2) yr(-1) globally, largely to offset residual CO2 and non-CO2 emissions, which remain costly to avoid even under scenarios specifically designed to reduce them.
   Carbon dioxide removal will be essential to reaching ambitious climate goals by offsetting hard-to-abate emissions and drawing down legacy CO2. A diverse portfolio of CO2 removal strategies, rather than any single approach, could achieve gigatonne-scale removals while limiting risks to the water-energy-land system.

AB While several actions are being taken to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from land-based transportation, marine transportations are often unnoticed. Ocean-going marine ships are accounted for a large amount of global GHG emissions. Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) are free from GHG emissions and playing an important role in sustainable development by lessening GHG emissions. Integration of RESs in ocean-going marine ships could be an option to make marine transportation free from emissions. Ocean-going marine ships require a large amount of reliable energy to support the propulsive load demand. RESs are intermittent, and a large amount of energy cannot be stored economically by the available energy storage techniques. Additionally, the penetration of RESs in a marine ship is limited by the available area and total weight carrying capacity of that marine ship. Because of these limitations of RESs in marine ships, there is a requirement of integrating other types of energy sources with RESs to support the baseload energy demand and to avoid the variableness of RESs. Conventional fossil fuel-based generators, like diesel generators, can be incorporated with RESs to overcome these shortcomings of RESs. However, as the penetration of RESs is limited to marine ships, most of the energy is supplied by fossil fuel-based generators. Therefore, the integration of RESs with fossil fuel-based generators merely reduces GHG emissions and is not a feasible option to make marine ships free from emissions. Fossil fuel-based generators need to be replaced by emissions-free and reliable energy sources to make the marine ships free from emissions. Small scale nuclear reactors, such as Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and Microreactors (MRs), are free from GHG emissions and are competitive candidates to replace fossil fuel-based generators. In this paper, four different energy systems have been analyzed for marine ships namely 'Stand-alone Fossil Fuel-based Energy System', 'Stand-alone Nuclear Energy System', Renewable and Fossil Fuel-based Hybrid Energy System' and Nuclear-Renewable Hybrid Energy System (N-R HES)' in terms of certain Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The KPIs include the Cost of Energy (COE), Net Present Cost (NPC), and GHG emissions. The results show that the N-R HES could be the best energy system for the marine industry to reduce GHG emissions and improve economic performance. A sensitivity analysis is also carried out by changing certain parameters to reinforce the findings of this study. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID MODEL
AB Underwater glider (UG) is one of the most promising devices for ocean sampling. However, when the UG is operating in a vast ocean space, its performance in terms of motion stability, energy efficiency and endurance is affected due to the buoyancy variation caused by the change of displacement and seawater density. It is essential to compensate for the buoyancy variation for performance improvement of the UG. This paper proposes a hybrid passive buoyancy compensation system (HPBCS), integrating three standalone buoyancy compensation devices of spring accumulator, inflatable accumulator, and silicon oil bladder, to compensate for the buoyancy variation. The mathematic compensation model of this system is established and an effective optimization algorithm hybridizing genetic algorithm and tabu search method is adopted to optimize the design parameters. The case study of a Petrel-II underwater glider shows that the optimal HPBCS can significantly improve the buoyancy compensation. Then the motion stability, energy efficiency and endurance of the UG with HPBCS are evaluated and compared with those of other UGs. Results indicate that the UG with HPBCS has a more superior performance in motion stability and energy efficiency, but its endurance is affected by the mass brought by HPBCS.

ID GENERATION; PREDICTION; CONVERSION; SYSTEM; SOUTH; SEA
AB Since waves fluctuate continuously, the forecast of the wave energy is very important for the operation of the power system integrated with large-scale wave energy generations. Waves are driven by wind, so that the relationship between wind and wave is very useful in wave energy forecast. Hence, a wave energy forecast method based on the wind-wave coupling model is proposed in this paper. The wave is first divided into wind waves and swells. The correlation between wind and wind wave is analyzed, and a wind-wave coupling model is established using copula function. Based on the coupling model and the forecasted wind speed, the average wave height of the wind wave can be forecasted, while the time series method is used to forecast the average wave height of the swell. Combining the wind wave and the swell, the average wave height of the integrated wave is obtained and the wave energy can be forecasted. Using the measured wind and wave data from a real ocean, the day-ahead wave energy is forecasted by the proposed method. The forecast result is close to the measured data and the effectiveness of the proposed wave energy forecast method is validated.

AB The processes leading to the depletion of oceanic mesoscale kinetic energy (KE) and the energization of near-inertial internal waves are investigated using a suite of realistically forced regional ocean simulations. By carefully modifying the forcing fields we show that solutions where internal waves are forced have similar to 25% less mesoscale KE compared with solutions where they are not. We apply a coarse-graining method to quantify the KE fluxes across time scales and demonstrate that the decrease in mesoscale KE is associated with an internal wave-induced reduction of the inverse energy cascade and an enhancement of the forward energy cascade from sub-to super-inertial frequencies. The integrated KE forward transfer rate in the upper ocean is equivalent to half and a quarter of the regionally averaged near-inertial wind work in winter and summer, respectively, with the strongest fluxes localized at surface submesoscale fronts and filaments.

AB The Earth energy imbalance (EEI) at the top of the atmosphere is responsible for the accumulation of heat in the climate system. Monitoring the EEI is therefore necessary to better understand the Earth's warming climate. Measuring the EEI is challenging as it is a globally integrated variable whose variations are small (0.5-1 Wm(-2)) compared to the amount of energy entering and leaving the climate system (similar to 340 Wm(-2)). Since the ocean absorbs more than 90% of the excess energy stored by the Earth system, estimating the ocean heat content (OHC) change provides an accurate proxy of the EEI. This study provides a space geodetic estimation of the OHC changes at global and regional scales based on the combination of space altimetry and space gravimetry measurements. From this estimate, the global variations in the EEI are derived with realistic estimates of its uncertainty. The mean EEI value is estimated at +0.74 +/- 0.22 Wm(-2) (90% confidence level) between August 2002 and August 2016. Comparisons against estimates based on Argo data and on CERES measurements show good agreement within the error bars of the global mean and the time variations in EEI. Further improvements are needed to reduce uncertainties and to improve the time series, especially at interannual timescales.

AB Current global historical reanalyzes prevent to adequately examine the role of the near-core surface wind structural properties on tropical cyclones climate trends. Here we provide theoretical and observational evidences that they are crucial for the monitoring of integrated kinetic energy. The kinetic energy balance is reduced to a simple rule involving two parameters characterizing the surface wind structure and directly suggested by the governing equations. The theory is uniquely verified with a database of high-resolution ocean surface winds estimated from all-weather spaceborne synthetic aperture radar. Such measurements provide indirect estimates of a multiplicative constant modulating the kinetic energy balance and associated with the system thermodynamics. Consequently, accumulated high-resolution acquisitions of the ocean surface shall allow to better monitor the integrated kinetic energy and provide new means to tackle climatological studies of tropical cyclones destructiveness.
   Studying the long-term climate trends of tropical cyclones is challenging because the historical data is not always reliable. One particular issue concerns the accurate reporting of surface wind properties near the core of these storms in past and present records. This study uses both theory and high-resolution surface wind observations from satellite radar to highlight the importance of investigating these properties, specifically for monitoring the total energy, which is a measure of a storm destructive potential. Two spatial scales describing the tropical cyclone wind structure are identified and may be efficiently measured thanks to the high-resolution sensor. The storm energy equilibrium is shown to be controlled by these two spatial scales, in both theory and observations. This equilibrium is also influenced by the temperature characteristics of a storm, which are themselves modulated by environmental and climatological conditions. Consequently, future high-resolution observations from the satellite radar should help better understanding the dependence of integrated kinetic energy with space and time.
   High-resolution spaceborne synthetic aperture radar measurements inform on the tropical cyclone kinetic energy balance The tropical cyclone integrated kinetic energy balance is controlled by the surface wind decay and thermodynamical characteristics Accumulating high-resolution surface wind measurements shall allow to better assess trends in the tropical cyclone destructive potential

AB To mitigate global warming within 1.5 degrees C, it is critical to leverage the resources of the marine system to reduce the magnitude of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Recent progress of the decarbonization in the ocean and the underlying subsurface sedimentary basin is reviewed in this study. Considerable research effort has gone into the decarbonization of cargo ships and offshore oil and gas platforms, which mainly includes two aspects: 1) replace and integrate the current fuel with clean energy, and 2) deploy the carbon capture technology. Many technologies have been demonstrated to be effective in decarbonization with some being commercialized recently. Wind turbines have been linked with emerging battery technologies to provide power to offshore projects, while other renewable energies such as wave, solar and tidal energies are in the research stage. Comparison of different CO2 storage technologies shows that CO2 storage in the offshore saline aquifers/reser-voirs is more achievable from the perspectives of cost and environmental concerns. The offshore CCUS projects under operation and planning until 2022 have been summarized, most of which are planned by companies in Europe near the North Sea. Nevertheless, ocean-based negative emission technologies (NET) are still in the early stage. Due to the high cost and the potential environmental concerns, there is still a long way to go before NET can be widely deployed for application.

AB Pursuing a sustainable energy transition at the city level represents a significant strategic aspect in the worldwide movement toward climate change mitigation and carbon neutrality achievement, as global cities account for large proportions of global energy consumption and emission. The current study explores the direction of future energy production and energy systems projecting to 2050. Data were collected from experts in the energy industry and the policy of Busan Metropolitan City, and these data were analyzed via explanatory factor analysis. The results pointed to four factors of future energy production: renewable energies, fossil fuel, bioenergy, and ocean energy. Four factors of future energy systems were also identified: prioritization on mobility and building, the role of actors, interactions between energy producers and consumers, and small-scale production. In general, for future energy production and systems, the experts strongly supported low carbon-intensive energy and distributed generation, respectively. It is also important for the various actors, such as policymakers, producers, and consumers, to be integrated to achieve sustainability and carbon neutrality. An interesting result is that the political orientation of experts led to different preferences, particularly regarding nuclear energy.

AB Power management in advanced grid systems requires the seamless integration of diverse renewable energy sources. This study investigates the optimization of a grid-connected system comprising a photovoltaic (PV) solar panel, energy storage system, fuel cell (FC), and diesel generator (DG) using the bioinspired metaheuristic technique called jellyfish optimization (JF). The objective is to maximize power generation from the PV system under normal and partial shading conditions. The performance of JF is compared against particle swarm optimization (PSO) using various parameters. As India heavily relies on solar PV, the results highlight JF's exceptional effectiveness in extracting maximum power during partial shading scenarios. Inspired by the active and passive motions of jellyfish in the ocean, the JF algorithm is utilized. To further optimize the power output, the system is integrated with an efficient battery management system, PEM fuel cell stacking, and diesel generators. The system's performance is analyzed using fast Fourier transform (FFT) to evaluate harmonic distortions, which consistently meet the limits specified in IEEE STD 1547-2018. Furthermore, unscented Kalman filter-based analysis is employed to assess total harmonic distortion (THD) and power rating for the grid system across various renewable energy scenarios. The contribution of the jellyfish optimization (JF) algorithm lies in its ability to efficiently and effectively maximize power generation from the PV system, regardless of normal or partial shading conditions. JF, a bioinspired metaheuristic optimization technique, successfully emulates the collective behavior of jellyfish in the ocean to identify optimal solutions. In this study, JF outperforms particle swarm optimization (PSO) in terms of power generation under partial shading conditions. Notably, JF exhibits remarkable capability in exploring the search space and discovering the global optimum, even when the system operates under challenging conditions. Overall, this study demonstrates the tremendous potential of JF in maximizing power generation in grid-connected systems with renewable energy sources while also highlighting the benefits of integrating additional components to further enhance the system performance.

AB This paper presents a study on a cost-effective engineering model that integrates an array of floating wave energy converters with a vast platform, a viable option for multi-functional performance in renewable energy capture and ocean space utilization. The wave energy converters are floating buoyance columns flexibly connected with the elastic platform. Hydrodynamic interactions among the columns are analyzed using an exact matrix transform method based on linear wave theory in the frequency domain. A parametric governing equation of compounded wave energy converter referred to as a wave farm is formulated by using Hamilton's principle which can be discretized using the Galerkin method. The effects of wave conditions and the parameters of hydraulic power take-off (PTO) on the wave energy absorption and dynamic characteristics of the energy harvesting system are investigated. Furthermore, the wave energy capture on irregular waves is also discussed. This research work aims at providing a theoretical guidance for wave energy harvesting system design.

AB This study investigates the effects of air-sea interaction upon simulated tropical climatology, focusing on the boreal summer mean precipitation and the embedded intra-seasonal oscillation (ISO) signal. Both the daily coupling of ocean-atmosphere and the diurnal variation of sea surface temperature (SST) at every time step by accounting for the ocean mixed layer and surface-energy budget at the ocean surface are considered. The ocean-atmosphere coupled model component of the global/regional integrated model system has been utilized. Results from the coupled model show better precipitation climatology than those from the atmosphere-only model, through the inclusion of SST-cloudiness-precipitation feedback in the coupled system. Cooling the ocean surface in the coupled model is mainly responsible for the improved precipitation climatology, whereas neither the coupling itself nor the diurnal variation in the SST influences the simulated climatology. However, the inclusion of the diurnal cycle in the SST shows a distinct improvement of the simulated ISO signal, by either decreasing or increasing the magnitude of spectral powers, as compared to the simulation results that exclude the diurnal variation of the SST in coupled models.

AB Intense tropical cyclones (TCs) can cause catastrophic damage to coastal regions after landfall. Recent studies have linked the devastation associated with TCs to climate change, which induces favorable conditions, such as increasing sea-surface temperature, to supercharge storms. Meanwhile, environmental factors, such as atmospheric aerosols, also impact the development and intensity of TCs, but their effects remain poorly understood, particularly coupled with ocean dynamics. Here, we quantitatively assess the aerosol microphysical effects and aerosol-modified ocean feedbacks during Hurricane Katrina using a cloud-resolving atmosphere-ocean coupled model: Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) in conjunction with the Regional Ocean Model System (ROMS). Our model simulations reveal that an enhanced storm destructive power, as reflected by larger integrated kinetic energy, heavier precipitation, and higher sea-level rise, is linked to the combined effects of aerosols and ocean feedbacks. These effects further result in an expansion of the storm circulation with a reduced intensity because of a decreasing moist static energy supply and enhancing vorticity Rossby wave outward propagation. Both accumulated precipitation and storm surge are enhanced during the mature stage of the TC with elevated aerosol concentrations, implying exacerbated flood damage over the polluted coastal region. The ocean feedback following the aerosol microphysical effects tends to mitigate the vertical mixing cooling in the ocean mixing layer and offsets the aerosol-induced storm weakening by enhancing cloud and precipitation near the eyewall region. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for the effects of aerosol microphysics and ocean-coupling feedbacks to improve the forecast of TC destructiveness, particularly near the heavily polluted coastal regions along the Gulf of Mexico.

AB This study reports on the analysis of the results from a 20 km grid spacing, Regional Coupled ocean-atmosphere Model (RCM) integration over the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WP2). The RCM was integrated over a 20-year period (1986-2005) using reanalysis boundary conditions for the atmosphere and the ocean. This is a first-of-a-kind study with an RCM at 20 km over the WP2. The RCM simulation shows reasonable fidelity of the mean state and of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). We utilize this successful integration of the RCM to understand a well-known observed feature of MJOs in the WP2 to be of the strongest amplitude during the December-March period of the year. Our analysis of the model integration reveals that the recharge of moist static energy (MSE) prior to peak MJO convection and its discharge during and after the convection explains the MJO in the simulation. The recharge/discharge of the MSE is shown to be largely dictated by horizontal advection, which is stemmed to a small extent by column-integrated radiative heating and surface evaporation. This balance of forces in the evolution of the MSE anomalies and their corresponding variations with sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies at MJO time-scales in the WP2 is strongest in the December-March period in the RCM simulation.

AB Fishing is one of the most important marine activities. It contributes to both overfishing and marine pollution, the two main threats to the ocean environment. In this context, the aim of this work is to investigate and validate methodologies for the identification of more sustainable operating configurations for a tuna purse seiner. The proposed methodology is based on a previous one applied to secondary industrial systems, taking into account the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control focus, developed for the most potentially industrial polluting sources. The idea is to apply the same type of methodologies and concepts used for secondary industrial punctual sources, to a primary industrial mobile activity. This methodology combines two tools: "Material and Energy Flow Analysis" (a tool from industrial metabolism), and "Best Available Techniques Analysis". The first provides a way to detect "Improvable Flows" into de system, and the second provides a way to define sustainable options to improve them.
   Five main Improvable Flows have been identified in the selected case study, the activity of a purse seiner, most of them related with energy consumption and air emission, in different stages of the fishing activity. Thirty-one Best Available Techniques candidates for the system have been inventoried, that potentially could improve the sustainability of the activity. Seven of them are not implemented yet to the case study. The potential improvements of the system proposed by this work are related to energy efficiency, waste management, prevention and control of air emissions. This methodology demonstrates to be a good tool towards sustainable punctual systems, but also towards sustainable mobile systems such as the fishing activity in oceans, as the tuna purse seiner validated here. The practical application of the identified technologies to fishing systems will contribute to prevent and reduce marine pollution, one of the greatest threats of today's oceans.

AB To achieve a better utilization of ocean space and energy, three integrated concepts of column-type wind turbine and heave-type wave energy converter (WEC) have been proposed for deep, intermediate and shallow water depth conditions, respectively. The WECs are installed on the wind turbine columns, then wave energy can be absorbed by power-take off (PTO) system through the relative heave motions between wind turbine column and the WEC. The spar-type floating wind turbines with long and short floaters are considered for deep and intermediate water depth conditions whereas a fixed-type wind turbine is considered for the shallow water depth condition. On the other hand, the WECs are torus-shaped heave-type devices, with dimensions and configurations the same for the three concepts. Numerical models are established for all the three concepts. The combined systems are subjected to various wind and wave conditions. The dynamic response analysis is carried out, and the responses including motions, forces and power, are compared among them. The results show that significantly different dynamic responses of the three concepts under environmental actions are observed.

AB We present a new approach to quantifying air-water flux and gas transfer velocity (k(600)) from underwater eddy covariance (EC) of dissolved oxygen. EC fluxes were measured 35 cm below the air-water interface using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) coupled with a fast-responding dissolved oxygen optode probe, integrated on a floating platform. A micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS)-based inertial motion unit integrated with the ADV enabled compensation of measured velocities for platform motion and changing sensor orientation. Deployments of 16 h and 30 h were conducted under low to moderate wind conditions in Sage Lot Pond, a small estuarine embayment. We evaluate air-sea flux parameterizations based on wind speed, current speed, and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate compared to our directly measured EC flux. Total kinetic energy was linearly correlated with EC-determined k(600), indicative of a more direct relationship to near surface turbulence compared to wind and current speed based parameterizations, which were subject to biases attributable to directional differences in fetch and low current speed. Our observations, which encompassed a period of low turbulent energy, suggest that existing parameterizations are not well constrained for these conditions. This new aquatic EC technique is highly advantageous for the determination of air-water exchange, especially in dynamic near-shore and inland systems. The system presented here has the potential for wide applicability for lake, riverine, and open-ocean air-water exchange and the results can be extrapolated for use with a wide range of biogeochemically relevant gases.

AB The ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) system uses the temperature difference between warm sea surface water and deep cold water to generate electrical power. Due to the low-temperature difference between surface warm water and deep-sea cold water, the thermal efficiency of these systems is low compared to fossil fuel-driven power plants. In the present study, to propose a method for increasing the output power, thermal efficiency, and heat storage of an OTEC cycle, the warm water outlet of the existing thermal power plant is used instead of surface water which is conventionally employed in basic OTEC cycles. The results show that, considering average electrical net power in the basic OTEC cycle per month the energy and exergy efficiencies are 3.34 % and 17.2 %, respectively. Then, the suggested OTEC cycle is investigated using a two-stage turbine and reheating in terms of energy and exergy. Comparing the results obtained for the two configurations shows that, in the proposed cycle, the average output power is increased by 552 kWh per month, and energy and exergy efficiencies are improved by 0.048 % and 0.31 %, respectively. As an existing thermal cycle performance, a case study of a real Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) is modeled with the proposed cycle. The results show that the average net electrical power is produced by 17.72 MWh per month by using the outlet water from the condenser of CCPP and the energy and exergy efficiencies have been increased by 1.432 % and 8.02 %, respectively Compared to the base cycle. Also, using condenser outlet warm water, an average of 18,829 tons per day of fresh water is produced, and the thermal efficiency of the CCPP is improved by 1.87 %.

AB The hybrid form of wave energy converter (WEC) is a recent advancement in research concerning harvesting energy from the ocean. This study investigates the effect of size and position of the point absorber integrated with a backward bent duct buoy. The aim of this optimisation is to maximise the WEC-absorbed power and heave response amplitude operators (RAO) at a specific sea site. The optimisation process was applied based on the data collected over a one-year period about sea characteristics for a nearshore region of the Mantanani Island. We present a methodology for optimising the Hybrid BBDB-PA based on a statistical analysis and the hydrodynamics of the system in the frequency and time domain. We used the ANSYS/AQWA software for the hydrodynamic diffraction analysis, and the design of experiments method was applied through the statistical software to determine the optimised parameters. We found that the diameter and gap length between PA and BBDB were found to significantly influence two characteristics, namely, heave RAO and maximum power absorption of PA. This observation shows that the PA size was directly proportional to the performance because a higher diameter has more contact with the ocean's wet surface area with the ocean and absorbed higher wave energy. Moreover, the gap length between the PA and BBDB was directly correlated with a wavelength, which followed the theoretical value for peak-to-trough length, where the maximum wave height occurs. Despite the condition parameter, we discovered that the WEC position and arrangement were responsible for the highest value of the power, regardless of the PA position used in the experiment. The results of this research provide recommendations for optimising the ocean energy harvesting in order to fully utilise ocean space for energy.

AB In the development of ocean energy technologies, full-scale sea trials have proven technically challenging and expensive. As a contribution to the development of flexible, reliable, and affordable measurement systems for such sea trials, this paper presents and evaluates a portable data acquisition system. The system offers a cheap and flexible option for when and where signal infrastructure at site is not available. It is battery powered and consists of a sensor system and a logger unit. The sensor system is placed inside the object of study, which for this application is a wave power generator standing on the seafloor. The logger unit, which contains a logger with integrated data storage and a battery, is placed outside the object of study in a submersible and retrievable vessel. Sensor output is carried with 4-20-mA current signals between the sensor system and the logger, which makes the system directly compatible with a wide range of industrial sensors. For the specific setup implemented in this paper, the sensor system was used to measure voltage and current inside the generator. Beyond this, the system is designed to be adaptable for a wider range of sensors, with 16 individual signals and a sampling frequency up to 1 kHz. The custom logger is programmable and offers many options to apply different logging schedules and to limit the sensor system power supply accordingly. Evaluations show that the implemented system offers 5-22 weeks of 1-kHz and 16-bmonitoring of 16 signals, depending on a chosen logging schedule. Suggestions are also given for how to raise the operation time up to 50 weeks. The system has been tested offshore for the collection of power production data from two wave energy converters, with good results.

AB This paper presents atmosphere-only and coupled climate model configurations of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecasting System (ECMWF-IFS) for different combinations of ocean and atmosphere resolution. These configurations are used to perform multi-decadal ensemble experiments following the protocols of the High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP) and phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). These experiments are used to evaluate the sensitivity of major biases in the atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere to changes in atmosphere and ocean resolution. All configurations successfully reproduce the observed long-term trends in global mean surface temperature. Furthermore, following an adjustment to account for "drift" in the subsurface ocean, coupled configurations of ECMWF-IFS realistically reproduce observation-based estimates of ocean heat content change since 1950. Climatological surface biases in ECMWF-IFS are relatively insensitive to an increase in atmospheric resolution from similar to 50 to similar to 25 km. However, increasing the horizontal resolution of the atmosphere while maintaining the same vertical resolution enhances the magnitude of a cold bias in the lower stratosphere. In coupled configurations, there is a strong sensitivity to an increase in ocean model resolution from 1 to 0.25 degrees. However, this sensitivity to ocean resolution takes many years to fully manifest and is less apparent in the first year of integration. This result has implications for the ECMWF coupled model development strategy that typically relies on the analysis of biases in short (< 1 year) ensemble (re)forecast data sets. The impacts of increased ocean resolution are particularly evident in the North Atlantic and Arctic, where they are associated with an improved Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, increased meridional ocean heat transport, and more realistic sea-ice cover. In the tropical Pacific, increased ocean resolution is associated with improvements to the magnitude and asymmetry of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability and better representation of non-linear sea surface temperature (SST)-radiation feedbacks during warm events. However, increased ocean model resolution also increases the magnitude of a warm bias in the Southern Ocean. Finally, there is tentative evidence that both ocean coupling and increased atmospheric resolution can improve teleconnections between tropical Pacific rainfall and geopotential height anomalies in the North Atlantic.

AB Ocean related activities are often supported by offshore equipment with particular power demands. These are usually deployed at remote locations and have limited space, thus small energy harvesting technologies, such as photovoltaic panels or wind turbines, are used to power their instruments. However, the inherent energy sources are intermittent and have lower density and predictability than an alternative source: wave energy. Here, we propose and critically assess triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) as a promising technology for integration into wave buoys. Three TENGs based on rolling-spheres were developed and their performance compared in both a "dry" bench testing system under rotating motions, and in a large-scale wave basin under realistic sea-states installed within a scaled navigation buoy. Both experiments show that the electrical outputs of these TENGs increase with decreasing wave periods and increasing wave amplitudes. However, the wave basin tests clearly demonstrated a significant dependency of the electrical outputs on the pitch degree of freedom and the need to take into account the full dynamics of the buoy, and not only that of TENGs, when subjected to the excitations of waves. This work opens new horizons and strategies to apply TENGs in marine applications, considering realistic hydrodynamic behaviors of floating bodies.

AB This study concerns a novel integrated three-compartment electrochemical reactor, developed in a lab environment. The reactor uses an electrolytic cation exchange method to capture considerable quantities of carbon dioxide from ocean water, in the forms of bicarbonate and carbonate, while concurrently producing hydrogen gas and capturing carbon dioxide for potential hydrocarbon synthesis. This study focuses on the performance and environmental impact of a novel E-CEM (Electrochemical-Continuous Electrodeionization Membrane) system under varying operational conditions such as such as energy and exergy efficiencies, exergy destruction rates, the exergoenvironmental impact factor, exergetic destruction ratio, exergetic sustainability index, entropy generation ratio, entropic environmental impact factor, sustainability index, and relative irreversibility under different temperatures between 10 degrees C and 90 degrees C and pressures between 100 kPa and 1000 kPa. Thermodynamic assessments using the Engineering Equation Solver offer quantitative evaluations of system performance, while exergoenvironmental analysis provides an advanced approach that combines exergy analysis with environmental impact assessment to evaluate both the performance and environmental sustainability of energy systems. An exergy destruction ratio value of the reactor is found to be 0.9 at 100 kPa and rises to 1.3 at 1000 kPa, showing increased exergy destruction, particularly at higher pressures. The E-CEM reactor achieves energy and exergy efficiencies of 7 % and 9 %, respectively.

AB Ocean waves are one of the most promising renewable energy sources for large-scope applications. Recently, triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) network has been demonstrated to effectively harvest water wave energy possibly toward large-scale blue energy. However, the absence of effective power management severely restricts the practicability of TENGs. In this work, a hexagonal TENG network consisting of spherical TENG units based on spring-assisted multilayered structure, integrated with a power management module (PMM), is constructed for harvesting water wave energy. The output performance of the TENG network is found to be determined by water wave frequencies and amplitudes, as well as the wave type. Moreover, with the implemented PMM, the TENG network could output a steady and continuous direct current (DC) voltage on the load resistance, and the stored energy is dramatically improved by up to 96 times for charging a capacitor. The TENG network integrated with the PMM is also applied to effectively power a digital thermometer and a wireless transmitter. The thermometer can constantly measure the water temperature with the water wave motions, and the transmitter can send signals that enable an alarm to go off once every 10 s. This study extends the application of the power management module in the water wave energy harvesting.

AB The study presents an energy performance improvement measure for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) carrying oceanographic equipment for collecting scientific data from the ocean. The required electric energy for the on-board equipment is harvested from tidal energy by using twin horizontal axis turbines which are integrated with thin-wall diffusers to enhance their energy capturing performance. The main focus and hence objective of the paper is the optimal design of the diffusers by using Reynolds Average Navier-Stokes Equations (RANSE) based Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method and the validation of the design using physical model tests.
   A goal-driven optimisation procedure is used to achieve a higher power coefficient for the turbine while keeping the size and the drag of the diffuser as practically minimum as possible. TIN main parameters of the optimisation are selected, the outlet diameter and the expansion section length of the diffusers, which are optimised for the highest flow acceleration ratio at the diffuser throat and for the minimum drag of the integrated diffuser and turbine system which is called as "Diffuser Augmented Tidal Turbine" (DATT) system.
   The numerical optimisation is validated by two sets of physical model tests conducted with a single turbine without diffuser and the same turbine integrated with the diffuser (DATT) in a cavitation tunnel and a circulating water channel. These tests demonstrated a performance enhancement for the turbine with the optimal diffuser by almost doubling the power coefficient of the turbine without the diffuser. However, the performance enhancement was dependent upon the pitch angle of the turbine. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SEA-LEVEL; OCEAN; CIRCULATION; BUDGET; HEAT
AB The current Earth's energy imbalance (EEI) can best be estimated from changes in ocean heat content (OHC), complemented by top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiation measurements and an assessment of the small non-ocean components. Sustained observations from the Argo array of autonomous profiling floats enable near-global estimates of OHC since 2005, which reveal considerable cancellation of variations in the upper 300 m. An analysis of the monthly contributions to EEI from non-ocean components (land and ice) using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Large Ensemble reveals standard deviations of 0.3-0.4 W m(-2) (global); largest values occur in August, but values are below 0.75 W m(-2) greater than 95% of the time. Global standard deviations of EEI of 0.64 W m(-2) based on top-of-atmosphere observations therefore substantially constrain ocean contributions, given by the tendencies of OHC. Instead, monthly standard deviations of many Argo-based OHC tendencies are 6-13 W m(-2), and nonphysical fluctuations are clearly evident. It is shown that an ocean reanalysis with multivariate dynamical data assimilation features much better agreement with TOA radiation, and 44% of the vertically integrated short-term OHC trend for 2005-14 of 0.8 +/- 0.2 W m(-2) (globally) occurs below 700-m depth. Largest warming occurs from 20 degrees to 50 degrees S, especially over the southern oceans, and near 40 degrees N in all ocean analyses. The EEI is estimated to be 0.9 +/- 0.3 W m(-2) for 2005-14.

AB It is critical to consider the evolving conditions of the future when designing energy systems. Information and communication technology is among the most power-hungry sectors and is expected to see substantial growth in energy consumption. To achieve net-zero targets while meeting growing demand, both existing fossil fuel driven systems and new energy systems should transition to clean energy systems, including nuclear and renewable-based systems. The current paper proposes an integrated energy system driven by a floating small modular reactor and offshore wind to generate fresh water, hydrogen, district heating and cooling options, and power for a floating data center and a sustainable community. The proposed design considers to be developed on unexploited water surfaces, including ocean. A floating SMR, based on high temperature gas-cooled pebble bed reactor technology with a 500 MW of thermal energy capacity, is integrated with a 192.3 MW offshore wind farm in a case study along the shores of Nova Scotia, Canada. The system is designed to meet a combined load with peaks of 3.6 MW electricity, 124.6 MW cooling, and 235.9 MW heating in a typical year. A multi-stage flash desalination and a two-stage Rankine cycle are considered for potential application on an offshore platform to desalinate sea water and generate power using heat from the floating SMR. The proposed system is evaluated with thermodynamic aspects, considering both energy and exergy perspectives. A time-dependent analysis over 8760 hours in a typical year provides insights into system performance under variable loads and energy sources. The overall energy and exergy efficiencies are 30.78 % and 22.91 %, when operated according to demand.

AB This paper presents a co-design framework that optimizes the kite design, site, and controller of a kite-based marine hydrokinetic (MHK) energy-harvesting system. The formulation seeks to maximize a techno-economic metric, namely power-to-mass ratio, by simultaneously considering three key categories of decision variables while accounting for the coupling between the three. The simultaneous consideration presents computational challenges associated with optimizing a large number of decision variables, a subset of which (control variables) are time trajectories. The multi-fidelity co-design formulation presented in this work utilizes two techniques, namely nesting and layering, to solve the optimization problem in a computationally tractable manner without significantly compromising on accuracy. Specifically, nesting allows for efficient integration of the three optimization sub-modules into one integrated framework without accuracy losses, whereas layering allows for successive design space reduction as the overall optimization progresses from using a low-fidelity model to using a higher-fidelity model. The resulting integrated co-design tool was applied to a region of interest off the North Carolina coast to optimally choose a combination of deployment site, kite design, and control strategy. We show that the integrated co-design tool results in a two-fold performance improvement over benchmarks derived from sequential (or independent) optimization of the kite categories, thereby underscoring the need for co-design. Computational effectiveness is demonstrated by comparing the computational cost of the nested and layered approach against the estimated computational costs that would be required to perform a single high-fidelity integrated optimization over the entire design space.

AB The exploitation and utilization of marine renewable resources is a significant component of marine environmental protection. Hence, a sustainable underwater energy supply system is required for related underwater devices such as environmental monitoring devices. Herein, we present an algae-inspired system that harnesses intermittent ocean solar energy to drive insertion/extraction processes of sodium ions from seawater to electrode materials for sustainable day-night energy supply. For this, we develop a combination of two optimization strategies for enhancing the environmental benignity of electrodes. The strategies include a polydopamine-assisted anchor technique to modify the Prussian blue (PB) electrode to prevent cyanide leakage. Also, a modified polyacrylonitrile-carbon felt (PAN-CF) was applied as a substitute for the MnO2 electrode to eliminate the presence of Mn metal in the water environment. After two modification strategies, the polydopamine coating technique can ensure almost no leakage of PB in the seawater. No dissolution of both the modified PB and Na-intercalated PB electrodes after being immersed can be found in authentic seawater for 4 months. Furthermore, the modified PB electrode and the PAN-CF electrode still show good electrochemical performance in day-night modes. Even after being used for 50 day-night cycles, the system still performed stably. These regulation strategies provide ideas for optimizing the environmental compatibility of electrode materials for other underwater battery systems. This is modified underwater solar conversion systems also showed other merits, such as the restoration of contaminated seawater, which promises their use as integrated devices for underwater energy supply and environmental restoration.

AB Underwater integrated sensing and communication (UISAC) systems employ a unified signal waveform to facilitate both data exchange and sense. However, communication-centric UISAC systems face challenges due to the stochastic nature of communication signals used for sensing, leading to diminished sensing performance. Meanwhile, sonar systems, in comparison to radar systems, operate in a complex noise environment with time-varying and non-Gaussian properties, further deteriorating sensing capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive algorithm using orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) signals for underwater target sensing. Our approach incorporates an online Gaussian-mixture model (GMM) to track time-varying background noise and utilizes a weighted Mahalanobis distance as a statistical measure to differentiate between reflected OTFS signals and ambient noise rather than relying solely on waveform. Comparative evaluations with existing energy detectors in UISAC system show that our strategy improves sensing accuracy, enhancing performance even in the presence of complex oceanic noise.

AB In the present study, novel processes for the offshore production of methanol via alternative routes than reforming of synthesis gas are investigated. Two process schemes are defined differing in the carbon source in input, i.e. the catalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide and the direct oxidation of methane via radical gas reaction. Both the schemes are considered to be installed at the main facility of the Canadian Sable Offshore Project in the Atlantic Ocean, the gas production Thebaud platform. Both offshore wind farm and solar parabolic trough systems are integrated to supply electricity and heat power to each process. The Aspen HYSYS is used to simulate the chemical processes, while Homer Pro and System Advisor Model are adopted for the design of feasible renewable energy plants. A thermodynamic modelling through energy analysis is conducted to evaluate and compare the energy efficiencies of sub-systems and overall schemes. Moreover, a preliminary design analysis is performed to estimate the footprint required for the components of the two schemes located on the offshore facility. The present results reveal that the methane-to-methanol process makes more efficient use of the integrated renewable sources but requires relatively higher space at the installation than the other scheme.

AB Hybrid energy-harvesting systems that capture both wave and solar energy from the oceans using triboelectric nanogenerators and photovoltaic cells are promising renewable energy solutions. However, ubiquitous shadows cast from moving objects in these systems are undesirable as they degrade the performance of the photovoltaic cells. Here we report a shadow-tribo-effect nanogenerator that hybrids tribo-effect and shadow-effect together to overcome this issue. Several fiber-supercapacitors are integrated with the shadow-tribo-effect nanogenerator to form a self-charging power system. To capture and store wave/solar energy from oceans, an energy ball based on the self-charging power system is demonstrated. By harnessing the shadow-effect, i.e. the shadow of the moving object in the energy ball, the charging time shortens to 253.3s to charge the fiber-supercapacitors to the same voltage (0.3V) as using pure tribo-effect. This cost-effective method to harvest and store the wave/solar energy from the oceans in this work is expected to inspire next-generation large-scale blue energy harvesting. Ubiquitous shadows cast from moving objects in hybrid energy-harvesting systems are undesirable as they degrade the performance of the photovoltaic cells. Here the authors report the shadow of the moving object in a hybrid energy-harvesting system shortens charging time to charge a self-charging power system.

AB It is proposed and substantiated that, in the oceanaEuro'atmosphere system, the microwave self-radiation intensity (brightness temperature), which is measured by means of satellites in the millimeter and centimeter wave bands, can be used as the direct characteristic of the thermal and dynamic parameters of the system. The vertical turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat and momentum are determined at the oceanaEuro'atmosphere interface according to the data measured by the special sensor microwave imagers located on weather satellites created in the scope of the defense meteorological satellite program and the advanced microwave scanning radiometer installed aboard the EOS Aqua oceanographic satellite. For the first time, the integrated (annual) characteristics of heat exchange between the ocean and atmosphere are investigated in the energy-active zones of the North Atlantic with the help of long-term satellite microwave radiometric measurements.

AB Global water planners are increasingly considering seawater desalination as an alternative to traditional freshwater supplies. Since desalination is both expensive and energy intensive, taking advantage of favorable natural and societal conditions while siting desalination facilities can provide significant financial and environmental returns. Currently, policy makers do not use a location-specific integrated analytical framework to determine where natural and societal conditions are conducive to desalination. This analysis seeks to fill that gap by demonstrating a multi-criteria, geographically-resolved methodology for identifying suitable regions for desalination infrastructure where 1) available renewable resources can offset part of the fossil energy load; 2) feedwater characteristics reduce the total energy needed for desalination; and 3) human populations have capacity and willingness to pay for desalinated water. This work demonstrates the method with a quantitative global analysis that identifies favorable sites for solar-aided seawater reverse osmosis desalination (SWRO) based on specific target criteria. Location-based data about natural conditions (solar insolation, ocean salinity, and ocean temperature) are integrated and mapped with social indicators (water stress, prevailing water prices, and population) to identify regions where solar-aided SWRO has the highest potential. This work concludes that water-stressed tropical and subtropical cities show the highest potential for economically sustainable solar-aided SWRO. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A new approach to rotational speed control structures based on an optimized intelligent recurrent wavelet-based Elman neural network (RWENN) controller used for the integration of offshore wind and wave energy conversion systems driven by a doubly fed induction generator. The nodes connecting the weights of the RWENN are trained online using a backpropagation method. A modified gravitational search algorithm (MGSA) is developed to adjust the learning rates and improve learning capability. The proposed control scheme has improved the real power regulation and dynamic performance of a combined wind and ocean wave energy scheme over a wide range of operating conditions. The performance of this control scheme is assessed by comparing it to a traditional proportional-integral based control scheme in a series of case studies representative of maximum power generation. Simulations are carried out using PSCAD/EMTDC software to verify the robustness of the power electronics converters and the efficiency of the proposed controller under steady state and transient conditions.

AB The fact that ocean surface waves are an integrated effect of meteorological activity has the interesting consequence that the memory of the wave systems is larger than that of the wind and storms that generated them. At each single point the related information is stored as its wave spectrum, a matrix containing the energy distribution of wave systems with different origins in space and time. We describe the concept of spectral partitioning and the technique used to obtain spectral statistics, whose outcome we associate with the physical reality. Using long series of spectral data we derive information of the, possibly very far, generation zones climatologically connected at a confluent point. Working on the eastern equatorial Pacific we focus on the prominent effects of El Nino events, for which interactions of mesoscale phenomena are revealed from the analysis of the local situation.

AB Tracking the energy balance of the Earth system is a key method for studying the contribution of human activities to climate change. However, accurately estimating the surface energy balance has long been a challenge, primarily due to uncertainties that dwarf the energy flux changes induced and a lack of precise observational data at the surface. We have employed the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) method, integrating it with recent developments in surface solar radiation observational data, to refine the ensemble of CMIP6 model outputs. This has resulted in an enhanced estimation of Surface Earth System Energy Imbalance (EEI) changes since the late 19th century. Our findings show that CMIP6 model outputs, constrained by this observational data, reflect changes in energy imbalance consistent with observations in Ocean Heat Content (OHC), offering a narrower uncertainty range at the 95% confidence level than previous estimates. Observing the EEI series, dominated by changes due to external forcing, we note a relative stability (0.22 Wm-2) over the past half-century, but with a intensification (reaching 0.80 Wm-2) in the mid to late 1990s, indicating an escalation in the adverse impacts of global warming and climate change, which provides another independent confirmation of what recent studies have shown.
   Estimated changes in the energy balance at the Earth's surface are consistent with observations of ocean heat content and have been relatively stable between about 1960 to 1995 with an intensification thereafter, suggest estimates of the surface energy imbalance with Bayesian model averaging and up-to-date observations.

AB Treatment of reverse osmosis desalination (ROD) brine has recently been suggested as a means to achieve negative greenhouse gas emissions via indirect ocean capture (IOC) of carbon dioxide. In this paper, a novel scheme that integrates the ROD/IOC process with combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) generation is proposed as a new negative emissions polygeneration system (NEPS). A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is then developed for the optimal synthesis and operation of such a system. The model uses a multi-period formulation to account for hourly variations in product demand and electricity price. The polygeneration system takes advantage of the flexible operation of the ROD/IOC process to operate as a Power-to-X (PtX) system, without the need for direct electricity storage in batteries. An illustrative case study is solved to demonstrate the model, and sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the effects of techno-economic uncertainties on system performance.

AB In this study, we conducted a novel massive Lagrangian simulation experiment based on a global 1/48 degrees tide-resolving numerical simulation of the ocean circulation. This first-time twin experiment enables a comparison between Eulerian (fixed-point) and Lagrangian (along-flow) estimates of kinetic energy (KE) across the global ocean, and the quantification of systematic differences between both types of estimations. This comparison represents an important step forward for the mapping of upper ocean high-frequency variability from Lagrangian observations of the Global Drifter Program. Eulerian KE rotary frequency spectra and band-integrated energy levels (e.g., tidal and near-inertial) serve as references and are compared to Lagrangian estimates. Our analysis reveals that, except for the near-inertial band, Lagrangian velocity spectra are systematically smoother, for example, with wider and lower spectral peaks compared to Eulerian counterparts. On average, Lagrangian KE levels derived from spectral band integrations tend to underestimate Eulerian KE levels at low-frequency and tidal bands, especially in regions with strong low-frequency KE. Better agreement between Lagrangian and Eulerian low-frequency and tidal KE levels is generally found in regions with weak low-frequency KE and/or convergent surface circulation, where Lagrangian particles tend to accumulate. Conversely, Lagrangian and Eulerian near-inertial spectra and energy levels are comparable. Our results demonstrate that Lagrangian estimates may provide a distorted view of low-frequency and tidal variance. To accurately map near-surface velocity climatology at these frequencies from drifter database, conversion methods accounting for the Lagrangian bias need to be developed.
   Ocean surface currents play a pivotal role in transporting heat and energy across the global ocean, thereby influencing global climate patterns and marine ecosystems. Despite the significant role of ocean currents in the Earth system, the spatial distributions of high-frequency ocean variability are not known accurately at the moment. In this study, we show that the information derived from the movements of surface drifters, which track ocean currents, may help fill this gap. This is demonstrated with global ocean numerical models, which are now able to represent high-frequency variability associated with tides, winds and eddies, and are therefore powerful tools to evaluate ocean multi-scale variability. We compare here fixed-point (i.e., "Eulerian") and along-flow (i.e., "Lagrangian" or drifter) kinetic energy estimates. Our results show that these two different perspectives can be reconciled in the estimation of energy levels, as long as adequate frequency bandwidths are chosen. However, the Lagrangian frame of reference can induce distortions of rapid motion signals compared to the Eulerian frame of reference, particularly in regions where low-frequency kinetic energy is strong and drifter density is low. These findings have implications for the mapping of near-surface velocity climatology at high frequencies from drifter database.
   The agreement between Lagrangian and Eulerian kinetic energy estimates is evaluated with a twin global numerical simulation experiment Lagrangian and Eulerian tidal energies agree best in regions where low-frequency kinetic energy is weak Near-inertial energy levels derived from Lagrangian and Eulerian frames of reference closely match compared to other frequency bands

AB Diapycnal mixing in the ocean interior is largely fueled by internal tides. Mixing schemes that represent the breaking of internal tides are now routinely included in ocean and earth system models applied to the modern and future. However, this is more rarely the case in climate simulations of deep-time intervals of the Earth, for which estimates of the energy dissipated by the tides are not always available. Here, we present and analyze two IPSL-CM5A2 earth system model simulations of the Early Eocene made under the framework of DeepMIP. One simulation includes mixing by locally dissipating internal tides, while the other does not. We show how the inclusion of tidal mixing alters the shape of the deep ocean circulation, and thereby of large-scale biogeochemical patterns, in particular oxygen distributions. In our simulations, the absence of tidal mixing leads to a relatively stagnant and poorly ventilated deep ocean in the North Atlantic, which promotes the development of a basin-scale pool of oxygen-deficient waters, at the limit of complete anoxia. The absence of large-scale anoxic records in the deep ocean after the Cretaceous anoxic events suggests that such an ocean state most likely did not occur at any time across the Paleogene. This highlights how crucial it is for climate models applied to the deep-time to integrate the spatial variability of tidally driven mixing as well as the potential of using biogeochemical models to exclude aberrant dynamical model states.
   Inclusion of realistic near-field tidal mixing substantially modifies global deep ocean circulation in the Early Eocene These tidally driven changes yield significantly different biogeochemical properties of water masses, in particular in the Atlantic The simulation that includes tidal mixing compares more favorably to inferences from the O2 proxy record

AB Ideal head height for pumped hydro energy storage/generation systems and reverse osmosis desalination plants coincide (500-700 m). Many drought stricken coastal regions have nearby mountains of sufficient elevation to support upper reservoirs at this ideal head height. A good symbiotic match might thus be realized by co-locating a pumped hydro plant with a reverse osmosis desalination plant, which we call an Integrated Pumped Hydro Reverse Osmosis (IPHRO) system. Combining systems reduces capital investment, such as pump costs, and solves the desalination brine disposal challenge since 10-20 times more water is required to generate one person's power needs than to generate their fresh water needs, so brine outflow can be diluted by the turbine output water reducing costs of diffusing outflow pipes. This paper describes an algorithm that weights distance from the ocean and mountain height to explore where around the world such IPHRO systems might be located. Design equations are presented to preliminarily explore the size and cost of an IPHRO system and enable first order site feasibility assessment. An example is given for providing power and water for one million people with an IPRHO system in southern California. Analysis and consideration of other sites is included in a supplementary document. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Metal corrosion causes billions of dollars of economic losses yearly. As a smart and new energy-harvesting device, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) can convert almost all mechanical energy into electricity, which leads to great prospects in metal corrosion prevention and cathodic protection. In this work, flexible TENGs were designed to use the energy harvested by flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films with ZrB2 nanoparticles and effectively improve the dielectric constant by incorporating ZrB2. The open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current were 264 V and 22.9 mu A, respectively, and the power density of the TENGs reached 6 W.m(-2). Furthermore, a self-powered anti-corrosion system was designed by the rectifier circuit integrated with TENGs, and the open-circuit potential (OCP) and Tafel curves showed that the system had an excellent anti-corrosion effect on carbon steel. Thus, the system has broad application prospects in fields such as metal cultural relics, ocean engineering, and industry.

AB Wave energy is acknowledged as one of the most promising renewable energy sources, effectively developing wave energy conversion technologies might contribute to solving the power shortage dilemma. However, the optimum performance frequency range of current wave energy capture devices does not match the lowfrequency ocean kinetic energy. Here, a triboelectric nanogenerator based on liquid mercury (M-TENG) is presented for low-cost and high-power harvesting. The start-up performance of the M-TENG unit is analyzed at low operating frequencies, and discuss the effect of kinematic inputs, structural parameters and materials aspects on output performance. Meanwhile, the sloshing characteristics of mercury in a rectangular unit were calculated by the SST k-? model, deriving the matching law between mercury volume and electrical output. Furthermore, 18unit integrated M-TENG produce a peak power output of 4.57 mW, the mercury with its unique physical properties generates higher transferred charge density up to 35.84 mC/m(3), sufficient to light 270 commercial LEDs at 1.00 Hz. The relatively high volumetric power density provides a realistic self-supply technological solution for renewable energy harvesting and guarantees the widespread use of milliwatt power equipment in the marine industry.

AB Nowadays generating electricity continuously in real waves over extended periods is a big challenge due to harsh ocean environment for wave energy converters (WECs). In this study, in order to enhance the reliability of WEC, a novel BIWEC which can form an integrated system by combing with existing floating platforms is proposed. This design method provides a robust mechanism for using wave energy efficiently and has been validated through the numerical simulations and physical model experiments of integrated systems. In addition, a comprehensive study and analysis on the coupling dynamic characteristics of the integrated system, as well as the influence of different power take-off (PTO) parameters on the power generation performance of BIWEC are conducted. Furthermore, using the typical wave conditions in the South China Sea (2-10 s wave period and 2 m wave height) as an example, the capture power and capture width ratio of BIWEC under various effective motion strokes and mass ratios are investigated. The research results indicate that the BIWEC has the characteristics of dual resonance frequencies, a wide range of wave frequency capture, and high energy conversion efficiency, and the results of the physical experiments are consistent with those of numerical simulations, validating the reliability of the physical experiments. In the physical experimental tests, the average mechanical efficiency of the BIWEC model is 49.17%. The research results presented in this paper have significant implications for the further promoting of commercialization of WEC.

AB The West Sumatra region experienced devastating floods and landslides due to intense rainfall on March 7-8, 2024, with precipitation ranging from 200 to 394 mm/day exceeding the extreme rainfall threshold of 150 mm/ day. We investigated the atmospheric dynamics to understand the mechanisms underlying this event. We used satellite data from Himawari-8 and Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) and ground-based observations to analyze cloud development and rainfall distribution. Wind velocity, Integrated Water Vapor Transport (IVT), Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE), Convective Inhibition (CINH), K-Index, Vertically Integrated Moisture Flux Convergence (VIMFC), and Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) from ERA5 reanalysis datasets are used to analyze convective instability and identify Equatorial waves. The Hybrid SingleParticle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model was employed to assess moisture transport. Our findings indicate that extreme rainfall was driven by the Mesoscale Convective System (MCS), as confirmed by cloud observations from Himawari-8. Further analysis revealed that moisture convergence, intensified by a Westerly Wind Burst (WWB) from the Indian Ocean, interacted with local topography and atmospheric circulations over West Sumatra. This interaction was associated with an active Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) in Phase 4, strengthening the westerly winds, transporting moisture and fueling convection. Before the event, MJO activity in Phase 3 over the Indian Ocean coincided with an atmospheric Kelvin wave, intensifying low-level convergence, enriching the Indian Ocean region with moisture, and transporting it to West Sumatra via the WWB. The interplay of the MJO, WWB, and Kelvin waves likely amplified the event. This study provides insights into the atmospheric processes behind this event and highlights their importance in developing early warning systems for future events.

AB This paper proposes a solar-ocean thermal energy conversion system (S-OTEC/AC) with integrated air conditioning cycles to provide power, cooling capacity, and fresh water in the South China Sea. Solar energy and surface seawater are used as heat sources in S-OTEC/AC system, the deep-sea water is used to absorb heat. The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is selected as the main cycle of OTEC, with R134a as the working medium. In order to improve the sustainability of the system, energy, exergy, economic, and environmental (4E) analysis models were proposed for the system. Parametric studies are performed to investigate the effects of R134a temperature at the evaporator outlet, turbine inlet, and outlet pressures, and water flow rate of solar heater on the system performance indicators. Furthermore, multi-optimization is conducted with the Levelized Cost Of Energy (LCOE) and the product of energy-exergy efficiencies (& eta;en,sys*& eta;ex,sys) as objective functions. The linear programming technique of multi-dimensional preference analysis (LINMAP) is introduced to make decisions on the Pareto front. Under basic conditions, the S-OTEC/AC system performs superior to the S-OTEC system in terms of energy, economy, and environmental friendliness. The additional profits of the AC cycle are represented by the annual water fee saving of 3.6x104 $/year and the cooling capacity of 85.8 kW, respectively. Sensitivity results show that water flow rate of solar heaters has the most obvious influence on system performance among the four key parameters. The results of optimizing the non-dominant scheme suggested by Pareto point show that optimized LCOE is 1.18 $/kWh, and & eta;en,sys*& eta;ex,sys is 7.81%. Under this condition, the system's network output, energy efficiency, and exergy efficiency are 89.32 kW,14.09%, and 52.83%, respectively.

TI Evaluation of the annual electricity production of a hybrid

   based wave energy converter; Annual energy production
AB Ocean waves constitute an abundant source of clean and predictable energy, with the potential to partly replace carbon intensive energy sources. At present, several technologies to convert wave energy into electricity are being developed, but those suitable for integration into port breakwaters present additional advantages. This paper presents a novel concept that combines two well-known wave energy conversion principles, an oscillating water column and a multi-reservoir overtopping system. This hybrid concept was designed to be integrated in rubble-mound breakwaters, having as case study Leixoes' northern breakwater, Portugal. The performance and efficiency of the single components were assessed separately as well as that of the hybrid module as a whole, to demonstrate the advantages of their combination into a single unit. Furthermore, the annual energy production was estimated for a 20 m wide hybrid module considering the local metocean conditions. Results showed that overall efficiency amounted to circa 44.4%, the wave-to-wire efficiency to 27.3% and the annual electricity production was estimated at 35 MWh/m. Considering that 240 m of the reference breakwater are used, the developed hybrid module could provide approximately 50% of the electricity consumption of the Port of Leixoes, which demonstrates the potential and interest of the developed technology.

AB The increasing global need for renewable energy has rendered the development of offshore wind energy extremely significant. In areas where ocean depths exceed 50 meters, conventional permanent foundations become economically unfeasible, becoming floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) a superior alternative. Simultaneously, the development of marine resources in offshore areas has failed to meet increasing market demand, necessitating the urgent expansion of aquaculture fisheries into deeper waters. This research developed a fully integrated model of a cage platform, net system, and mooring system, compatible with the NREL 5MW wind turbine. Numerical simulation methods, based on potential flow theory and Morrison's equation, are utilized to examine the motion response characteristics of the coupled system under various sea conditions. The study results demonstrate that the net, acting as a damping element, significantly decreased the system's motion response and enhanced its stability. The system's dynamic response is influenced by wave height and period in both regular and irregular wave circumstances, particularly under extreme sea conditions. Furthermore, the net's presence minimally affects the wind turbine's power output while contributing to the mitigation of power fluctuations. The examination of complex environmental circumstances influenced by wind, waves, and currents reveals that a rise in current velocity markedly changes the system's surge motion trend, although it has little impact on power output. The work establishes a theoretical framework for the design and optimization of deep-sea wind-fishery integrated systems, providing insights into the maximization of marine resource utilization and the commercial deployment of wind energy.

AB Objective: Ocean planning provides opportunities for managers to evaluate tradeoffs among environmental, social, economic, cultural, and management considerations in the development of place-based activities. Early integration of mobile protected species considerations into ocean planning reduces the likelihood of future resource conflict. Transparency and problem solving with potential conflicts in mind during the early planning stages can help to minimize contention and increase efficiency in permitting and may also minimize litigation challenges during project design and implementation. Starting with a large area, such as the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's (BOEM) initial 12.1-million-ha call area in federal waters of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, provided substantial geographic scope for identifying suitable areas for eventual offshore wind lease sales that also aim to minimize conflict across multiple resources and uses.
   Methods: To support ocean planning for this large-scale activity, a generalized scoring system for protected species status and trends that facilitates relative comparison between species was developed. Spatial data for species listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act or the Marine Mammal Protection Act were assembled. Species layers were scored based on species status and trend. The cumulative vulnerability for 23 species groups whose distributions overlap suitable areas proposed for eventual lease sales, termed wind energy areas (WEAs) by BOEM, was calculated.
   Result: Integrating this combined protected species data layer into the broader Gulf of Mexico WEA ocean planning process helped to reduce potential protected species conflicts by 70%.
   Conclusion: This generalized approach is directly applicable to other WEAs under consideration within the United States and is transferable to a variety of ocean spatial planning applications.

AB Wave energy is a significant ocean renewable resource with vast reserves and wide distribution. Integrating a wave energy converter (WEC) and a floating breakwater offers an effective answer to promote its commercialization. In this study, model tests are conducted to investigate the wave energy absorption and attenuation performance of the WEC-breakwater hybrid system with various WEC geometries, focusing on narrow-gap resonance. Optimal configurations for gap width and WEC dimensions were identified. The results reveal a significant improvement in both energy absorption and wave attenuation performance of the WEC-breakwater hybrid system compared to single WEC or single breakwater. Particularly, the hybrid system with an asymmetric triangle-baffle WEC exhibits broader efficiency range frequency and superior wave energy conversion efficiency, while also enhancing the wave reduction capabilities of the floating breakwater for short waves. Effects of the narrow gap resonance on the hybrid systems with symmetric and asymmetric WECs differ. The system with a narrower gap and a slender WEC exhibits better wave energy absorption performance, but the influence on wave attenuation is found to be limited. These findings could provide valuable recommendations for designing WEC-breakwater hybrid systems, helping to avoid unnecessary costs resulting from improper design.

AB Ecosystem-based management (EBM) of the ocean considers all impacts on and uses of marine and coastal systems. In recent years, there has been a heightened interest in EBM tools that allow testing of alternative management options and help identify tradeoffs among human uses. End-to-end ecosystem modeling frameworks that consider a wide range of management options are a means to provide integrated solutions to the complex ocean management problems encountered in EBM. Here, we leverage the global advances in ecosystem modeling to explore common opportunities and challenges for ecosystem-based management, including changes in ocean acidification, spatial management, and fishing pressure across eight Atlantis (atlantis.cmar.csiro.au ) end-toend ecosystem models. These models represent marine ecosystems from the tropics to the arctic, varying in size, ecology, and management regimes, using a three-dimensional, spatially-explicit structure parametrized for each system. Results suggest stronger impacts from ocean acidification and marine protected areas than from altering fishing pressure, both in terms of guild-level (i.e., aggregations of similar species or groups) biomass and in terms of indicators of ecological and fishery structure. Effects of ocean acidification were typically negative (reducing biomass), while marine protected areas led to both "winners" and "losers" at the level of particular species (or functional groups). Changing fishing pressure (doubling or halving) had smaller effects on the species guilds or ecosystem indicators than either ocean acidification or marine protected areas. Compensatory effects within guilds led to weaker average effects at the guild level than the species or group level. The impacts and tradeoffs implied by these future scenarios are highly relevant as ocean governance shifts focus from single-sector objectives (e.g., sustainable levels of individual fished stocks) to taking into account competing industrial sectors' objectives (e.g., simultaneous spatial management of energy, shipping, and fishing) while at the same time grappling with compounded impacts of global climate change (e.g., ocean acidification and warming).

AB Underwater gliders are well known as a type of enduring platform for underwater exploration; nevertheless, they have also been criticised in terms of their compromised course-keeping capability, particularly in harsh ocean environments. A motion controller that can improve motion accuracy while maintaining a low energy demand is preferred by developers and operators. In this paper, a motion controller based on a combined feedforward and Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control is proposed. The controller has been evaluated in terms of energy consumption and motion accuracy with a fully coupled numerical model integrating the vehicle dynamics, the energy consumption and the control system. A energy-accuracy chart and a quadrant analysis are then introduced to support the analysis of the controller performance and the identification of the optimum operating conditions. Based on the prototype underwater glider that has been developed at Tianjin University, various case studies in different ocean environmental conditions are performed. The results show that the method proposed can quantitatively evaluate the performance of the vehicle to effectively achieve the balance between energy consumption and motion accuracy which can support the decision-making process for the best operation strategy.

AB It is currently clear that the atmosphere and ocean should be simulated by integrated modelling systems resolving interconnected physical factors that determine the Earth's energy balance. Waves play a key role in the interfacial interaction between the atmosphere and the ocean, regulating momentum, heat and moisture exchange. This study aims to evaluate the CHAOS two-way coupled atmosphere-ocean wave system (Chemical Hydrological Atmospheric Ocean wave System) over the Mediterranean and Black Seas. The evaluation is performed against in situ and remote sensing data for the period from 1 December 2013 to 1 December 2014. CHAOS includes the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) model, version 3.8, as atmospheric component and the Wave model (WAM) cycle 4.5.4 as ocean wave component, coupled through the OASIS3-MCT coupler, version 3.0. Two continuous model simulation approaches were followed to assess the impact of atmosphere-ocean waves coupling. In the first approach (1-way coupling mode), the ocean wave component uses the winds produced by the atmospheric component, while in the second approach (2-way coupling mode) the atmospheric component additionally uses sea state information estimated by the ocean wave component through wave-dependent Charnock parameter computations. In the 2-way coupling mode, the attenuation of the atmospheric flow has a damping effect on wind-generated waves. The simulations in 2-way coupling mode produce more realistic results yielding statistical improvements. Compared against buoy observations, the 2-way mode reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) 1.2% for wind speed and 6.3% for significant wave height, while against Jason-2 satellite retrievals the reduction is 0.5% and 2.4%, respectively. Additionally, the 2-way coupling mode outperformed the 1-way mode under intense wind and wave conditions during the one-year period considered.

AB Wind work at the air-sea interface is the transfer of kinetic energy between the ocean and the atmosphere and, as such, is an important part of the ocean-atmosphere coupled system. Wind work is defined as the scalar product of ocean wind stress and surface current, with each of these two variables spanning, in this study, a broad range of spatial and temporal scales, from 10 km to more than 3000 km and hours to months. These characteristics emphasize wind work's multiscale nature. In the absence of appropriate global observations, our study makes use of a new global, coupled ocean-atmosphere simulation, with horizontal grid spacing of 2-5 km for the ocean and 7 km for the atmosphere, analyzed for 12 months. We develop a methodology, both in physical and spectral spaces, to diagnose three different components of wind work that force distinct classes of ocean motions, including high-frequency internal gravity waves, such as near-inertial oscillations, low-frequency currents such as those associated with eddies, and seasonally averaged currents, such as zonal tropical and equatorial jets. The total wind work, integrated globally, has a magnitude close to 5TW, a value that matches recent estimates. Each of the first two components that force high-frequency and low-frequency currents, accounts for similar to 28% of the total wind work and the third one that forces seasonally averaged currents, similar to 44 %. These three components, when integrated globally, weakly vary with seasons but their spatial distribution over the oceans has strong seasonal and latitudinal variations. In addition, the high-frequency component that forces internal gravity waves, is highly sensitive to the collocation in space and time (at scales of a few hours) of wind stresses and ocean currents. Furthermore, the low-frequency wind work component acts to dampen currents with a size smaller than 250 km and strengthen currents with larger sizes. This emphasizes the need to perform a full kinetic budget involving the wind work and nonlinear advection terms as small and larger-scale low-frequency currents interact through these nonlinear terms. The complex interplay of surface wind stresses and currents revealed by the numerical simulation motivates the need for winds and currents satellite missions to directly observe wind work.

AB Recently, introduced the concept of a "vortex proxy" based on an observation of strong correlations between integrated kinetic energy and integrated enstrophy over a large enough surface area. When mesoscale vortices are assumed to exhibit a Gaussian shape, the two spatial integrals have particularly simple functional forms, and a ratio of them defines an effective radius of a "proxy vortex". In the original work, the idea was tested over a restricted area in the Californian Current System. Here we extend the analysis to global scale by means of 25 years of AVISO altimetry data covering the (ice-free) global ocean. The results are compared with a global vortex database containing over 64 million mesoscale eddies. We demonstrate that the proxy vortex representation of surface flow fields also works globally and provides a quick and reliable way to obtain coarse-grained vortex statistics. Estimated mean eddy sizes (effective radii) are extracted in very good agreement with the data from the vortex census. Recorded eddy amplitudes are directly used to infer the kinetic energy transported by the mesoscale vortices. The ratio of total and eddy kinetic energies is somewhat higher than found in previous studies. The characteristic westward drift velocities are evaluated by a time-lagged cross-correlation analysis of the kinetic energy fields. While zonal mean drift speeds are in good agreement with vortex trajectory evaluation in the latitude bands 30-5 degrees S and 5-30 degrees N, discrepancies are exhibited mostly at higher latitudes on both hemispheres. A plausible reason for somewhat different drift velocities obtained by eddy tracking and cross-correlation analysis is the fact that the drift of mesoscale eddies is only one component of the surface flow fields. Rossby wave activities, coherent currents, and other propagating features on the ocean surface apparently contribute to the zonal transport of kinetic energy.

AB The large-scale, nonlinear and uncertain factors of hybrid power systems (HPS) have always been difficult problems in dynamic stability control. This research mainly focuses on the dynamic and transient stability performance of large HPS under various operating conditions. In addition to the traditional synchronous power generator, wind-driven generator and ocean wave generator, the hybrid system also adds battery energy storage system and unified power flow controller (UPFC), making the system more diversified and more consistent with the current actual operation mode of the complex power grid. The purpose of this study is to propose an adaptive least squares Petri fuzzy probabilistic neural network (ALTS-PFPNN) for UPFC installed in the power grid to enhance the behavior of HPS operation. The proposed scheme improves the active power adjustment and dynamic performance of the integrated wave power generation and offshore wind system under a large range of operating conditions. Through various case studies, the practicability and robustness of ALTS-PFPNN method are verifying it by comparison and analysis with the damping controller based on the designed proportional integral differential (PID) and the control scheme without UPFC. Time-domain simulations were performed using Matlab-Simulink to validate the optimal damping behavior and efficiency of the suggested scheme under various disturbance conditions.

AB Conventional ocean monitoring systems utilizing single-mode triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are fundamentally limited by their dependence on unimodal signal acquisition, which results in a critical lack of recognition accuracy and early warning reliability. To address this, we propose a highly integrated, multimodal self-powered AI-enhanced monitoring system (SAMS) for diverse ocean state monitoring. SAMS combines solid-solid and liquid-solid TENG modes, incorporating three distinct triboelectric conversion mechanisms. SAMS features a spherical framework with a freestanding-layer electret generator on its lower surface, detecting subtle wave vibrations through continuous liquid-solid contact. The upper surface features a double-electrode electret generator, enhanced via oxygen plasma treatment, which sensitively captures intermittent liquid-solid interactions (e.g., splashes and scours) under high-intensity waves, producing signals up to 80 V. Internally, a spiral electret generator with a dual-spiral structure generates in-plane and out-of-plane vibrations, delivering outputs of up to 100 V and significantly expanding detectable wave motion ranges. The triple-modal design of the SAMS enables simultaneous generation from three signal channels. Assisted by deep learning, the SAMS achieves a substantial improvement in wave level recognition accuracy, from 41.25 % (single-mode) to 96.25 % (triple-mode). This work advances multimodal TENGs for intelligent marine monitoring and enables real-time energy harvesting and state monitoring in complex marine environments.

AB We investigate the turbulent dynamics of the coupled atmosphere-ocean-sediment system around a wind turbine. To this end, a coupled two-dimensional idealized numerical model of the ocean and sediment layers, forced by an idealized offshore wind turbine wake is used. The turbine wake impacts the ocean surface and for strong wind and water layer thickness higher than 20 m, large scale eddies of the size comparable to the wake thickness are generated, leading to a turbulent dynamics in the ocean.
   The turbulence in the ocean is controlled by the shallow wake parameter S. The turbulent ocean dynamics is numerically integrated using time dependent simulations at fine horizontal resolution (1 m). From these simulations, eddy coefficients parametrizating the turbulent fluxes are proposed to be used in larger-scale (RANS) models. The ocean dynamics and the parameter values depend mainly on S. The ocean dynamics is laminar (S > 7.10(-2)), has a localized (7.10-2 <S < 7.10(-2)) or domain wide turbulent (S < 3.10(-2)) behavior. In the first two cases, changes in seabed elevation are around a few millimeters per month. For the third case, averaged over several days, changes decreases to a few tenths of millimeters per month. This is due to the alternating local velocity which transports sediments back and forth. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A single wave energy converter (WEC) produces a low and fluctuating power, and the use of a permanent magnet linear generator (PMLG) as an electric power take-off unit can make the situation worse because the power produced from a PMLG varies with each incident wave. The use of a short-term energy storage unit as an energy buffer will become necessary to mitigate the fluctuating power. However, the addition of the energy storage system will further increase the cost of the WEC. This paper proposes a modelling strategy for the wave-to-wire system of WEC arrays, consisting of Archimedes wave swings coupled with PMLGs, to analyze its power output quality and grid compliance without the integration of any energy storage system. The measured hydrodynamics of ocean waves are used for the analysis of the system. The developed model for the wave-to-wire system is tested under various scenarios for its power output quality while maintaining grid code compliance. The flicker level at the point of common coupling for the wave farm is evaluated for grids of varying strength. The simulation results show that the proposed configuration of the wave-to-wire system can be integrated with the grids of sufficient strength, without the need for expensive energy storage units, while complying with the grid code in the respective countries, such as Ireland, UK and Nordic countries. The main contributions of this paper are (i) a new modelling strategy to analyze a wave-to-wire system, (ii) simulation studies to analyze the power quality and grid code compliance of a wave-to-wire system, (iii) recommendations for the required grid strength to integrate wave farms to the grid.

ID IMPACT
AB With the need to integrate renewable energy sources into the current energy portfolio and the proximity of power consumers to ocean coastlines, it is important to evaluate marine energy systems, specifically wave energy converters (WECs), as potential solutions for meeting electricity needs. The ability to model these systems computationally is vital to their eventual deployment. The power development, economics, grid integration requirements, operations and maintenance requirements, and ecological impacts must be understood before these devices are physically installed. However, the research area of WEC array optimization is young, and the few available results of previously implemented optimization methods are preliminary. The purpose of this work is to introduce a new WEC array optimization framework to explore systems-level concerns, specifically WEC layout and device spacing. A genetic algorithm approach that utilizes an analytical hydrodynamic model and includes an array cost model is presented, and the resulting optimal layouts for a preliminary test case are discussed. This initial work is integral in providing an understanding of device layout and spacing and is a foundational starting point for subsequent and more advanced WEC array optimization research.

AB Marine current turbines (MCTs) are a burgeoning renewable energy technology that may effectively capture the kinetic energy of ocean currents to produce power. Nevertheless, the sporadic and uncertain characteristics of marine currents present substantial obstacles to the reliable functioning of grid-connected MCT systems. By incorporating Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) into grid-connected marine current turbines and implementing intelligent event-triggered Sliding Mode Control (ETSMC), we can significantly improve the transient voltage stability of marine renewable energy systems. The sophisticated event trigger mechanism continuously checks the circumstances of the grid and the operation of the turbine in real-time. The real-time nonlinear control technique enhances the performance of SMES by effectively regulating the flow of active and reactive power, hence ensuring grid stability during transient occurrences. This integrated system aims to improve the dependability and effectiveness of marine current turbine operations, thereby supporting the progress of sustainable marine renewable energy technologies. The resilience of the system was evaluated by its implementation in real-time on a dSPACE-DS1104 board, which was connected to an experimental laboratory bench. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis was conducted by comparing actual and simulated data in order to assess both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the system.

AB The effective acquisition of hydrogen energy from the ocean offers a promising sustainable solution for increasing global energy shortage. Herein, a self-powered high-efficient hydrogen generation system is proposed by integrating a triboelectric-electromagnetic hybrid nanogenerator (TEHG), power management circuit (PMC), and an electrolytic cell. Under the wind triggering, as-fabricated TEHG can effectively convert breeze energy into electric energy, which demonstrates a high output current of 20.3 mA at a speed rotation of 700 rpm and the maximal output power of 13.8 mW at a load of 10 M omega. Remarkably, asdesigned self-powered system can perform a steady and continuous water splitting to produce hydrogen (1.5 mu L center dot min-1) by adding a matching capacitor between the PMC and electrolytic cell. In the circuit, the capacitor can not only function as a charge compensation source for water splitting, but also stabilize the working voltage. Unlike other self-powered water splitting systems, the proposed system does not need catalysts or the complex electrical energy storage/release process, thus improving the hydrogen production efficiency and reducing the cost. This work provides an effective strategy for clean hydrogen energy production and demonstrates the huge potential of the constructed self-powered system toward carbon neutralization.

AB Over the latest decades, oil marine pollution has posed a vital threat for global ocean health, since spillages of any scale are related to environmental, social and financial impacts. The worldwide increase in oil and gas demand, and the parallel rise in oil and gas production, exploiting particularly coastal and offshore marine deposits, have significantly increased the risk of accidental oil release to the sea. In the present study, an operational oil spill model was applied to test the oil dispersive properties and to reveal the relative magnitude of weathering processes, after an accidental oil spill release along the main tanker transportation route in the North Aegean Sea. Numerical simulations were implemented using the OpenOil transport and fate numerical model, a subclass of the OpenDrift open-source trajectory framework. This model integrates algorithms with several physical processes, such as oil entrainment, vertical mixing, oil resurfacing and oil emulsification. The oil dispersion model was coupled to real-time met-ocean forecasts received from NOAA-GFS and CMEMS. Present simulation results have focused on the impact of turbulent kinetic energy, induced by the background flow field, on the horizontal spreading of particles, as well as on the evolution of oil mass balance and oil mass properties.

AB The marine distributed wireless sensor network system can promote the development of offshore wind turbine environmental monitoring. However, traditional ocean sensors and large power generation equipment are hard to meet the requirements of distributed sensor networks. Hence, we proposed a free-floating structure triboelectric nanogenerator (FF-TENG) based on the all-in-one ocean energy harvesting and sensing device concept for offshore wind turbine environmental monitoring. The FF-TENG device follows the integrated structure design of the sphere and floating body, which brings high wave energy capture efficiency and high wave sensing sensitivity. In this design, the wool ball plays the role of the triboelectric material owning to excellent positive triboelectricity. And the lightweight characteristic of the wool ball endows the FF-TENG device with fine wave-following properties in the ocean environment. In rolling working mode, when the motion amplitude and frequency are 5 cm and 4.5 Hz, the instantaneous open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current (Isc) of a single FF-TENG can arrive at 462 V and 15.5 mA, respectively. The transferred charge (Qsc) of a single FF-TENG can reach 107 nC. According to the results, the FF-TENG device can achieve a 4.26 times energy harvesting effect compared with nine-independent spherical TENG. Moreover, the Isc of FF-TENG represents a nicely linear relationship with the swing angle (minimum frequency: 0.2 Hz), which indicates that the FF-TENG can monitor the change of wave frequency and amplitude. This research provides a new path for all-in-one ocean energy harvesting and sensing device in offshore wind turbine environmental monitoring.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB To maximize the utilization of ocean resources, shorten the return period of investment and directly supply energy to the fishing cage, this paper performs a preliminary study for a state-of-the-art concept integrating a floating offshore wind turbine with a fishing cage. An octagonal semisubmersible rigid fishing cage with a slack catenary mooring system is designed to match the NREL 5 MW offshore baseline wind turbine. Combined with the blade pitch controller, fully coupled aero-hydro-elastic-servo-mooring simulations are performed through FAST and AQWA to explore the dynamic performance of the integrated system. Free decay conditions, uniform wind with irregular and regular waves, and turbulent wind with irregular waves are tested. The results showed that the integrated system works normally at the operating conditions and exhibits different dynamic characteristics for various scenarios. Additionally, the study on the influence of mooring line length indicates that the increasing line length can significantly affect the cage surge motion and the maximum and mean values of the upwind line tension at fairlead. Specifically, the maximum surge motion with a 924-m-long line is 404.8% larger than that with an 880-m-long line. When the line length increases by 5%, the maximum and mean line tensions decrease by 45.7% and 47.7%, respectively, while when the line length increases by 10%, the maximum and mean line tension decrease by 52.9% and 54.2%, respectively. It should be noted that the main purpose of this work is to conduct a preliminary study on this integrated system, aiming to provide an idea for the conceptual design, modeling and simulation analysis of this integrated system.

AB This paper describes an alternative approach for improving the output power performance for coastal wave impact energy harvesting systems, located at water-structure interfaces. This is achieved by simultaneously coupling the triboelectric and piezoelectric effects, exhibited in some materials. The use of finite element modelling, and experimental electrical characterization, enables the integration of hybrid devices into a breaking water wave generator tank. This provides a mechanism for simulating actual ocean wave conditions at low frequencies (0.7 Hz-3 Hz). Enhancements in the output performance by a factor of 2.24 and 3.21, relative to those obtained from using single triboelectric and piezoelectric nanogenerators, were achieved. This is demonstrated by evaluating the output current, voltage, transferred charge, and charging performance from a grid of up to four hybrid devices connected to capacitors of different capacitance values. Such hybrid devices were capable of powering a one-way wireless transmitter with a generated output power between 340.85 mu W and 2.57 mW and sent a signal to a receiver at different distances from 2 m to 8 m. The research shows that such an integrated device can provide a promising mechanism for developing high-performance energy harvesting mechanisms for ocean wave impact to drive self-powered systems having an average power consumption of 1-100 mW. Further, it is estimated that through the construction of large water-hybrid nanogenerator-structure interfaces, output powers of approximately 21.61 W can be generated for powering networks of self-powered sensing systems in smart large-scale applications.

AB Climate change exacerbates uncertainties in water resource management, water supply, and treatment that are energy intensive and then exert great pressure on climate change mitigation; hence, interrelated and contradictory characteristics within the water-climate change (WC) nexus system are needed to be studied. The nexus thinking and coordination of WC would impact many realistic practices and assist in sustainable socioeconomic development since traditional single-target policies have sometimes been out of function. Hence, the ability to direct water production and use as well as climate change mitigation has become a hotspot recently. Furthermore, we find that there has been no complete research on reviewing the impacts of the WC nexus in different areas on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Hence, this paper builds a core nexus of WC and then analyzes those effects on social and environmental aspects in many areas, including sewage treatment, energy transition, waste treatment, land management, and ocean management. This paper discusses how WC interlinkages are utilized to realize SDGs in those areas. Moreover, uncertainties derived from exogenous hydrology, climate change, and anthropogenic endogenous systems for realistic problems appeal to gradually increasing concern. Finally, implications offer valuable guidelines for integrated management of water and carbon emissions, as well as sustainable socioeconomic development in the future.

AB Even to this date, most earth system models are coded in Fortran, especially those used at the largest compute scales. Our ocean model Veros takes a different approach: it is implemented using the high-level programming language Python. Besides numerous usability advantages, this allows us to leverage modern high-performance frameworks that emerged in tandem with the machine learning boom. By interfacing with the JAX library, Veros is able to run high-performance simulations on both central processing units (CPU) and graphical processing unit (GPU) through the same code base, with full support for distributed architectures. On CPU, Veros is able to match the performance of a Fortran reference, both on a single process and on hundreds of CPU cores. On GPU, we find that each device can replace dozens to hundreds of CPU cores, at a fraction of the energy consumption. We demonstrate the viability of using GPUs for earth system modeling by integrating a global 0.1 degrees eddy-resolving setup in single precision, where we achieve 1.3 model years per day on a single compute instance with 16 GPUs, comparable to over 2,000 Fortran processes.

AB One of the main routes to overwhelm the environmental challenges is to switch to sustainable energy sources and hybrid energy conversion plants. In this newly developed model, the integration of the ocean thermal energy conversion-based Reverse osmosis desalination unit and hydrogen generation and compression cycle is simulated and proposed. The combined system generates sustainable power, compressed green hydrogen, and freshwater with integrated subsystems. A detailed thermodynamic simulation and sustainability index assessment are conducted on the various system parameters to determine changes in system efficiency. In this theoretical study, the developed system is motivated by warm sea water temperature which is assumed 35 degrees C. The thermodynamic modeling, that is energy and exergy performances, and also exergy destruction approaches, is applied to each subsystem and the overall plant by parametric examination method. The consequences expression that the net power generation capacity of this configuration is 150.5 kW, the green hydrogen generation rate is 0.0003011 kgs(-1), and also, the freshwater capacity is 4.755 kgs(-1). Finally, the developed plant performance ratio is determined as 12.20 % of energetic performance and 24.71 % of exergetic performance.

AB The urgent need for an energy transition from conventional to renewable energy sources (RE) has become a strategic priority to ensure a sustainable and clean energy supply. In archipelagic nations, renewable energy technologies must be reliable, sustainable, predictable, and environmentally compatible with local wisdom and development goals. Indonesia possesses a total tidal current energy potential of 17.9 GWh, with the Maluku archipelago predicted to have a power density of approximately 4.75 kWh from tidal energy conversion. This study introduces a Floating Ocean Current Power Plant (FOCPP) prototype, incorporating a ducted tidal turbine and a floating moored pontoon system. The platform integrates a low-speed synchronous generator and other electrical components. The prototype was tested in the Haya Strait, Western part of Seram Island, Indonesia, where tidal current speeds reached 2.54 m/s. The results demonstrated a turbine speed enhancement of 1.25-2.65 times, achieving a peak operational period of 19 h per day and producing 72 kWh of energy daily, 2206.4 kWh monthly, and 38.9 MWh annually. These findings suggest that implementing ducted tidal turbines in small island communities can provide a sustainable clean energy solution with minimal greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study highlights the potential for global and national support in accelerating the transition toward renewable energy adoption in remote and underserved regions.

AB Establishing a hybrid offshore renewable energy harvest system (HOREHS) on a shared platform can reduce energy costs and increase productions. This paper aims to propose a HOREHS supported by a foundation consisting of a monopile and a plate to integrate various offshore renewable energy devices. Taking the Sheringham shoal wind farm as a case study, the benchmarking monopile dimensions were determined using design guidance and an equivalent monopile-plate combination was determined from FEM simulations. Parametric studies of system mechanical responses were conducted using FEM simulation. It is found that, to maintain the same mechanical response, the embedded depth of the monopile supporting the HOREHS should be increased by about 17% comparing with that supporting an offshore wind turbine. Adding a 14 m diameter steel plate can avoid the extra 17% embedded depth. Adding a plate has no effect on the size of influence zone of lateral soil stress. However, due to the shorter embedded depth, the magnitude of lateral stress for the hybrid foundation is larger than that for monopile, with the maximum increase being about 18%. The system response at the mudline level shows the highest sensitivity to the changes in embedded depth and plate diameter.

ID OPTIMAL VORTEX FORMATION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; JELLYFISH
AB Substantial efforts have been made to expand our knowledge of the phys-ics, biology, chemistry, and geography of the ocean using state-of-the-art measurement tools. With new global projects and technological advances, the collaborative efforts of the Ocean Decade (2021-2030) are well on the way to revolutionizing our knowledge of ocean sciences and sustainability. Yet even today, over three-quarters of the seafloor is still unmapped, more than 90% of marine life still awaits discovery and classification, and the number of ocean sensors required to study global phenomena at sufficient tem-poral and spatial resolutions is seemingly intractable. To address this challenge, new approaches such as bio-inspired robotics can expand our existing toolbox and bridge this knowledge gap. The concept of biology-inspired engineering has emerged as a powerful tool to complement traditional engineering approaches to technology development. For example, specific swimming features of jellyfish and fish have been applied to a variety of fields, from vehicular propulsion to wind energy to medical diagnostics. In particular, jellyfish are advantageous model organisms because of their energy efficiency, with the lowest known cost of transport compared to other animals, as well as their ubiquity and survivability in various ocean environments. In this article we highlight the evolution of research into jellyfish-inspired robotic constructs and their potential applications in ocean exploration. After initial projects using entirely engineered materials (i.e., jellyfish -inspired submarine propellers) and tissue engineering methods (i.e., rat cardiac cells seeded on flexible films), recent work to integrate microelectronic systems onto live jelly-fish demonstrates that their swimming speeds can be increased (up to three times com-pared to their baselines) and their energy efficiency can be improved (up to four times compared to their baselines). This shows promise for the robotic control of jellyfish in real-world oceanic environments, where the animals are already distributed globally. Future work can improve the maneuverability of these bio-hybrid jellyfish robots, incor-porate miniaturized sensors to profile regions of interest, and ultimately deploy swarms of these low-power, low-cost robots to obtain high-resolution data and improve ocean climate models. The synergy of bio-inspired technologies with existing ocean measure-ment tools holds promise to push the frontiers of ocean exploration and stewardship.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) shows great potential in the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) system, in which the path planning algorithm plays a fundamental role. However, the complex underwater environment brings greater challenges to AUV path planning, especially the ocean current, which has a profound impact on time and energy consumption. This article focuses on the complex ocean current condition and proposes an underwater path planning method based on proximal policy optimization (UP4O). In this novel method, a deep reinforcement network is constructed to serve as a decision control to plan the moving direction of AUV. An information encoding module is developed to extract the features of the local obstacles. Furthermore, UP4O integrates the obstacle features with the current state information, including relative position, ocean current, and velocity, enabling the AUV to focus on the global direction and local obstacles at the same time. Additionally, to further adapt to the ocean current and shorten the time cost, UP4O expands the action space of AUV, realizing a fine and flexible action adjustment. The wide applicability of UP4O has been proved by numerous experiments. The proposed algorithm can always plan the time-saving and collision-free paths in complex underwater environments with various terrains and ocean current.

AB Oceanographic observations in the northern Gulf of Mexico captured an unusual combination of atmospheric forcing and shelf frontal dynamics that brought about the surface ventilation of sediment-laden bottom waters. Colorimetric analysis of in situ optical data indicates a specific turquoise-white color signature for turbid and low-oxygen bottom waters that match a coincident shelf-wide feature detected in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite true color images. The physical processes leading to this ventilation event are simulated using the Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System, which includes an integrated surface wave model. The combined model-data analysis suggests that low-oxygen, bottom water ventilation may occur episodically during boreal spring and summer in the northern Gulf of Mexico following the passage of high-energy atmospheric systems, and these events may be identified in the historical satellite record based on the unique bottom water optical characteristics.

AB The Arctic Ocean is a major sink for heat and salt for the global ocean. Ocean mixing contributes to this sink by mixing the Atlantic- and Pacific-origin waters with surrounding waters. We investigate the drivers of ocean mixing north of Svalbard, in the Atlantic sector of the Arctic, based on observations collected during two research cruises in summer and fall 2018. Estimates of vertical turbulent heat flux from the Atlantic Water layer up to the mixed layer reach 30 W m(-2) in the core of the boundary current, and average to 8 W m(-2), accounting for similar to 1% of the total heat loss of the Atlantic layer in the region. In the mixed layer, there is a nonlinear relation between the layer-integrated dissipation and wind energy input; convection was active at a few stations and was responsible for enhanced turbulence compared to what was expected from the wind stress alone. Summer melting of sea ice reduces the temperature, salinity and depth of the mixed layer and increases salt and buoyancy fluxes at the base of the mixed layer. Deeper in the water column and near the seabed, tidal forcing is a major source of turbulence: diapycnal diffusivity in the bottom 250 m of the water column is enhanced during strong tidal currents, reaching on average 10(-3) m(-2) s(-1). The average profile of diffusivity decays with distance from the seabed with an e-folding scale of 22 m compared to 18 m in conditions with weaker tidal currents. A nonlinear relation is inferred between the depth-integrated dissipation in the bottom 250 m of the water column and the tidally driven bottom drag and is used to estimate the bottom dissipation along the continental slope of the Eurasian Basin. Computation of an inverse Froude number suggests that nonlinear internal waves forced by the diurnal tidal currents (K-1 constituent) can develop north of Svalbard and in the Laptev and Kara seas, with the potential to mix the entire water column vertically. Understanding the drivers of turbulence and the nonlinear pathways for the energy to turbulence in the Arctic Ocean will help improve the description and representation of the rapidly changing Arctic climate system.

AB One of the most important challenges in global climate change research is balancing the carbon budget within the global carbon cycle. Carbon burial in sediments at the land-ocean interface has been difficult to quantify and model because it represents non-steady-state boundary conditions that are also affected by human activities. In this study, we document carbon burial rates in the Yangtze River (1.6-4.9 x 10(12) gC year(-1)) and Hudson River (1.8-3.6 x 10(10) gC year(-1)) estuaries and integrate our results with carbon burial rates determined by others in the world's 25 largest river-estuarine systems (6-11 x 10(13) gC year(-1)). Our results indicate that carbon burial in estuaries, bays, coves, lagoons, mud flats, marshes, mangroves, and other highly productive or protected low-energy areas at the land-ocean interface along the entirety of the world's coastlines may serve as an unrecognized sink within the global carbon budget.

AB Eco-friendly harnessing of both ocean chemical energy and solar energy would represent a sustainable solution for future energy conversion/storage systems, but it has been challenging to enhance the energy efficiency of such systems for practical applications. Here, we demonstrate an efficient photoelectrochemical-assisted rechargeable seawater battery. By integrating TiO2 nanostructure-based photoelectrodes with the seawater battery, we achieved significant enhancement of the voltage efficiency during the charging/discharging processes; effective photocharging with the TiO2 photoanode reduced the charging voltage to similar to 2.65 V, while the heated carbon felt (HCF) cathode in the seawater battery exhibited charging/discharging voltages of similar to 3.8 V and similar to 2.9 V, respectively. Such a charging voltage reduction led to a voltage efficiency of similar to 109%. Moreover, interestingly, we found that TiO2 nanostructures showed excellent photoelectrochemical performances in seawater in association with the efficient photocharging. As a result, the utilization of TiO2 nanostructures as photocharging/discharging electrodes provides a feasible strategy to optimize the cell configuration for highly efficient solar seawater batteries.

AB One promising renewable energy source for the future is wave energy, harnessed through L-Oscillating Water Column (L-OWC) Wave Energy Converters (WECs). Combining this device with lightweight floating breakwaters can have several advantages, including absorbing wave energy and attenuating waves. L-OWC and two cylindrical floating breakwaters, one in front of the structure and one at the back are coupled in the current study. Previous research indicates that the L-shaped OWC configuration is highly effective due to its increased added mass and enhanced structural stability. The 1:30 scale model, combining a floating breakwater with an Oscillating Water Column (OWC) system, was experimentally investigated in the wave flume at the NITK, Department of Water Resources and Ocean Engineering. This setup included L-shaped OWCs integrated with cylindrical breakwater configurations (2C, 3C, and 4C). OWCs integrate with lightweight floating breakwaters, offering both wave attenuation and energy extraction. The OWC achieved maximum efficiency of 30% under optimal conditions, with a wave period of approximately 1.8s and a wave height of 0.06 m for the model with three floating breakwaters. The work aligns with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), specifically addressing clean and affordable energy (SDG 7), industry, innovation, and infrastructure (SDG 9), life below water (SDG 14), and life on land (SDG 15), highlighting its significant impact.

AB Planetary boundaries (PB) is a novel conceptual framework that assesses the state of processes fundamental to the stability of the Earth system. Studies argue a non-linear relationship between economy and environmental degradation, known as the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). We postulate this inverted-U association between PB and economic output in a worldwide sample. This paper, therefore, examines the correlation between changes in environmental conditions and global economic growth, incorporating the growth rate of key control variables (population, financial development, merchandise trade and regulations). Thus, we intend to identify and address the main gaps in these EKC studies and analyse the impacts of worldwide economic growth on global environmental change. PB variables are identified as the more integrated perspective with regard to this change. These planetary boundaries include various proxies: global CO2 concentration as a climate change proxy, threatened species for biodiversity loss, the total ozone for ozone depletion, mean surface ocean hydrogen ion concentration for ocean acidification and global fertiliser consumption for biochemical cycles. Under this integrated perspective, the EKC hypothesis is supported for climate change and ocean acidification panels using a dynamic system generalized method of moments (GMM) approach. Meanwhile, biochemical cycles, ozone depletion and freshwater use, land change and biodiversity loss boundaries do not support the existence of the EKC shape using the same methodology. The results provide an additional and novel view to be factored into the decisions of policymaker and investment institutions to contribute to sustainable development in all countries.

AB High-resolution modelling systems have increasingly become an essential requirement to investigate ocean dynamics over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, and to integrate the punctual ocean observations. When applied in coastal areas, they also have the potential to provide a detailed representation of transport and exchange processes at the sub-basin scale. This paper presents a validation exercise between the surface fields generated by the regional ocean modeling system (ROMS), developed for the Tyrrhenian Sea and downscaled for the Gulf of Naples (GNAM Gulf of Naples advanced model), and a 4 year-long (2009-2012) record of high-frequency radar (HFR) data. The comparison between hourly and seasonal model results and HFR surface fields is focused on the Gulf of Naples (GoN), where an observational network of three HFR sites has been operational since 2004, and on a specific subdomain characterized by the presence of the Sarno river, a long-term ecological research station (LTER-MC) and one important canyon area. An evaluation on a transect delimiting inshore-offshore zones in the GoN is also presented. The GNAM model was also compared with in situ hydrological parameters of temperatures and salinities retrieved at the LTER-MC fixed monitoring station. According to the skill metrics, basic circulation features are accurately reproduced by the circulation model, despite some model drawbacks in terms of increment of energy content in the surface current field occurring during specific seasonal events. The results allow us to identify potential model errors and to suggest useful improvements, the outcome also confirms the unique capability of HF radar systems to provide fine-scale measurements for the validation of numerical models and to counterbalance the lack of high-resolution measurements in coastal areas.

SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE

ID MECHANICAL METAMATERIALS
AB Clusters of machinery units coupled tightly may emerge collective behavior and act like the metamaterial to tackle agitations from the environment. It is especially meaningful for exploiting water wave energy, which is a promising clean energy source with enormous reserves but a formidable challenge for traditional bulky generators. Here, a novel three-dimensional (3D) chiral network of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) is designed for the first time to effectively harvest water wave energy based on this idea. Unlike traditional bulky and rigid machines, the 3D TENG network adopts a distributed architecture with chiral connections between unbalanced units, which imparts the network flexibility, hyper-elasticity in water, and wave-absorption behavior, similar to mechanical chiral metamaterials. The network can be configured to different scales and depths to harvest wave energy in all directions. A comprehensive energy harvesting system integrated with a power management circuit is constructed, with the stored energy enhanced by about 319 times. The novel 3D chiral network shows great potential for blue energy harvesting and self-powered systems based on TENGs, which can be more adaptive to severe ocean environments with flexible and distributed characteristics. This study also presents an insightful paradigm shift from mechanical metamaterial designs to energy harvesting networks, with similarities in mechanical wave energy absorption and conversion, inspiring novel energy harvesting systems and other strongly coupled machinery systems of multiple units based on metamaterials.

AB Data assimilation (DA) combines observational data and the dynamical ocean model to forecast the ocean state in a matter that is not possible from either observations or models by themselves. However, the incorporation of data -derived corrections into the model introduces the potential to disrupt the dynamical balance of the model state, leading to initialization shocks. These shocks arise as the model undergoes a process of adjustment to restore the perturbed dynamic balance, involving the generation of spurious near -inertial motions. Notably, the US Navy's global ocean forecast system strives to mitigate these issues through the implementation of the Incremental Analysis Update (IAU) method, distributing the DA corrections to the model state across a specified time window (3 h in the operational system). Our study shows that, despite the implementation of this 3 h IAU period, the initialization shocks still persist in the model analysis fields. We find that during DA updates, spurious internal waves are generated that are in a broad near -inertial frequency range and propagate long distances from their generation sites in the form of low -mode near -inertial waves. The depth -integrated, time -mean near -inertial kinetic energy in a simulation with DA is 68% higher than in a corresponding forward simulation (free -run, without DA) of the simulation with the same surface wind forcing. The presence of these spurious near -inertial waves disrupts the ocean model energetics, and minimizing them is crucial for using the assimilative model simulations to study small scale/high-frequency ocean dynamics. We also examine a possible way to minimize the spurious internal waves by extending the IAU period in numerical experiments using regional model simulations. We demonstrate that the generation of spurious near -inertial waves can be minimized if we insert increments of smaller magnitude at each time step during the update, which can be achieved by extending the IAU period. Our findings indicate that in simulations with a 24 h IAU period, the variance of near -inertial kinetic energy between the assimilative and forward simulations is reduced to approximately 1%.

AB We build a conceptual coupled model of the climate and tidal evolution of the Earth-Moon system to find the influence of the former on the latter. An energy balance model is applied to calculate steady-state temperature field from the mean annual insolation as a function of varying astronomical parameters. A harmonic oscillator model is applied to integrate the lunar orbit and Earth's rotation with the tidal torque dependent on the dominant natural frequency of ocean. An ocean geometry acts as a bridge between temperature and oceanic frequency. On assumptions of a fixed hemispherical continent and an equatorial circular lunar orbit, considering only the 41 kyr periodicity of Earth's obliquity epsilon and the M-2 tide, simulations are performed near tidal resonance for 10(6) yr. It is verified that the climate can influence the tidal evolution via ocean. Compared with the tidal evolution with constant epsilon, that with varying epsilon is slowed down; the Earth-Moon distance oscillates in phase with epsilon before the resonance maximum but exactly out of phase after that; the displacement of the oscillation is in positive correlation with the difference between oceanic frequency and tidal frequency.

AB The integration of renewable energy technologies (solar, wind, biomass, ocean, geothermal energy) is gaining importance in the United Arab Emirates owing to the high energy demand and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper presents the analysis and results of the performance and optimization of a stand-alone solar PV power system with single-axis (horizontal and vertical) and dual-axis solar trackers and a diesel generator (DG) for the city of Khorfakkan, Sharjah. The modeling, simulations, and optimization analysis of the hybrid energy system (HES) were performed with the HOMER software based on the daily energy consumption of 37.75 MWh in the study area. The simulation results show that employing an HES with dual-axis solar trackers is the best power system architecture considering the renewable fraction (48.55%) and levelized cost of energy (LCOE; 0.25 $/kWh). The proposed HES meets the annual energy demand of the city (13,778 MWh) without shortages and with an electricity excess of 9.81%. In addition, the sensitivity analysis shows that the HES with dual-axis solar PV tracking system provides lower electricity costs (250 $/MWh) and the highest GHG emission reduction (69.6%, which is equivalent to the GHG emission reduction of a diesel engine consuming 682,279 gallons of diesel fuel).

AB This study examines the joint spatiotemporal variability of summertime climate linked to renewable energy sources (precipitation and streamflow, wind speeds, and insolation) and energy demand drivers (temperature, relative humidity, and a heat index) across the contiguous United States (CONUS) between 1948 and 2015. Canonical correlation analysis is used to identify the primary modes of joint variability between wind speeds and precipitation and related patterns of the other hydrometeorological variables. The first two modes exhibit a pan-U.S. dipole with lobes in the eastern and central CONUS. Composite analysis shows that these modes are directly related to the displacement of the western ridge of the North Atlantic subtropical high (NASH), suggesting that a single, large-scale feature of atmospheric circulation drives much of the large-scale climate covariability related to summertime renewable energy supply and demand across the CONUS. The impacts of this climate feature on the U.S. energy system are shown more directly by examining changes in surface climate variables at existing and potential sites of renewable energy infrastructure and locations of high energy demand. Also, different phases of the NASH are related to concurrent and lagged modes of oceanic and atmospheric climate variability in the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean basins, with results suggesting that springtime climate over both oceans may provide some potential to predict summer variability in the NASH and its associated surface climate. The implications of these findings for the impacts of climate variability and change on integrated renewable energy systems over the CONUS are discussed.

AB The study presents a novel integrated three-compartment electrochemical continuous electrodeionization reactor that was constructed in a laboratory environment. In order to extract large amounts of carbon dioxide from naturally occurring oceanwater in the form of bicarbonate and carbonate, it develops a innovative electrolytic cation exchange process. At the same time, it produces hydrogen gas for possible hydrocarbon synthesis. The study employs the Box-Behnken experimental design approach implemented through the Design Expert software to investigate and optimize the performance of electrochemical hydrogen extraction from Ocean water from an integrated reactor. The integrated electrochemical continuous-type electrodeionization reactor comprises two cation-permeable membranes that operate as boundaries between three compartments: a central compartment and electrode compartments that house the cathode and anode, each of which may reverse polarity. These membranes are made of gel polystyrene cross-linked with divinylbenzene, which has acidic properties that allow cation transport while inhibiting anions. The integrated reactor's electrode chambers are enclosed in plexiglass end plates and contain distinct Plexiglass electrode compartments. These compartments have mesh and solid steel anode and cathode electrodes, with an electrode active area of 176.71 cm2. The influence of various factors, such as voltage and electrolyte amount, on the production of hydrogen synthesis is examined. The study results demonstrate a maximum hydrogen production rate of 2.2 mg/min and a hydrogen production efficiency of 7.82%. The lab testing was carried out using experimental equipment to determine viability. The tests included 35-min runs that measured hydrogen generation under various parameters, such as applied voltage, electrolyte concentration, and pH levels. The ocean salt solutions of 0.5M, 1M, and 2M were initially prepared and evaluated for hydrogen generation. Each concentration is assessed at a voltage range of 4-15V, with matching solution pH values ranging from 2 to 7. Optimization studies were conducted to enhance the hydrogen production rate. The results indicate that hydrogen production rises proportionally with applied voltage and electrolyte concentration but falls with pH growth. Within the Design Expert software, the statistical methods for response surface analysis and optimization are utilized accordingly.

AB During the early and middle Miocene, the Mediterranean had become a restricted marginal marine sea with diminishing and ultimate loss of connectivity to the Indian Ocean. This dramatically changed the heat, energy, freshwater and nutrient budgets across the Mediterranean and most notably in its eastern basin. While one of the most prominent lines of evidence of this change in the Eastern Mediterranean is the onset of sapropel formation, many other aspects of the sedimentary system changed in response to this rearrangement. Here we present a detailed analysis of a hemipelagic succession from southwestern Cyprus dated to the late Aquitanian to the early Serravallian (22.5-14.5 Ma). This sequence is carbonate-dominated and formed during the decoupling of the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean. It exhibits sedimentation with mass transport contribution from shallow water carbonates to deeper facies with phosphatization and bottom current (at intermediate depth) interactions. This succession traces both local subsidence and loss of a local carbonate factory. Additionally, it records a shift in bottom current energy and seafloor ventilation, which are an expected outcome of connectivity loss with the Indian Ocean.

AB The constant development of electronic inverter technology has played a key role in promoting the exploration and development of solar ships. For the large-scale ocean-going ship platform, the critical issue of applying solar photovoltaic (PV) system is integrating PV equipment into the ship power system (SPS) without changing its original structure. This paper compares the existent technical differences for applying the off-grid and grid-connected PV system in the SPS and proposes the basic design principles for marine integration applications. The 5000 PCTC ro-ro ship is set as the application object, on which a hybrid PV system with large-capacity lithium battery storage device is designed and installed as an independent subsystem. The typical feature of this hybrid PV system is that it can implement operation mode switching between off-grid and grid-connected, according to the evaluation on solar radiation resource, power load requirement and state of charge in the lithium battery. The test results show that this PV system has a stable operation characteristic under different operation modes. In addition, this ship-based PV power system has automatic and reliable operation management capability, which could effectively reduce manual control frequency and maintenance workload of a marine engineer.

AB High-frequency radars (HFR) are traditionally used in coastal environments to observe ocean current and wave characteristics. With an HFR forward model, HFR adjoint model, and the Simulating Waves Nearshore model, HFR Doppler spectra observations were used to estimate near-surface winds in the Southern California Bight in October 2017. The HFR 10-m wind retrievals were assimilated into the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) with the COAMPS four-dimensional variational (4DVar) assimilation system to integrate the HFR wind retrievals into the initial conditions. Impact of the HFR-derived winds on the forecast are evaluated in terms of adjoint-derived forecast sensitivity observation impact (FSOI), and by an observing system experiment that compared forecasts from simulations that assimilated the HFR wind retrievals to a control simulation that excluded HFR winds. The addition of the HFR-estimated wind observations reduced the error in the forecasted dry energy norm in the lowest model level and also contributed to small improvements in the 10-m wind field over a 25-day experiment. The potential benefit of this new method to estimate near-surface ocean winds near the coast for data assimilation and improved numerical weather prediction is an exciting advancement in remote sensing of coastal winds and expands the benefit of existing HFR networks beyond their intended use. More importantly, wind fields retrieved from HFR have the potential to fill an observation gap near the shoreline where ship and buoy observations are sparse and scatterometer observations are unavailable due to land contamination.

AB State-of-the-art Earth system models typically employ grid spacings of O(100 km), which is too coarse to explicitly resolve main drivers of the flow of energy and matter across the Earth system. In this paper, we present the new ICON-Sapphire model configuration, which targets a representation of the components of the Earth system and their interactions with a grid spacing of 10 km and finer. Through the use of selected simulation examples, we demonstrate that ICON-Sapphire can (i) be run coupled globally on seasonal timescales with a grid spacing of 5 km, on monthly timescales with a grid spacing of 2.5 km, and on daily timescales with a grid spacing of 1.25 km; (ii) resolve large eddies in the atmosphere using hectometer grid spacings on limited-area domains in atmosphere-only simulations; (iii) resolve submesoscale ocean eddies by using a global uniform grid of 1.25 km or a telescoping grid with the finest grid spacing at 530 m, the latter coupled to a uniform atmosphere; and (iv) simulate biogeochemistry in an ocean-only simulation integrated for 4 years at 10 km. Comparison of basic features of the climate system to observations reveals no obvious pitfalls, even though some observed aspects remain difficult to capture. The throughput of the coupled 5 km global simulation is 126 simulated days per day employing 21 % of the latest machine of the German Climate Computing Center. Extrapolating from these results, multi-decadal global simulations including interactive carbon are now possible, and short global simulations resolving large eddies in the atmosphere and submesoscale eddies in the ocean are within reach.

AB The rate of ocean heat uptake depends on the mechanisms that transport heat between the surface and the ocean interior. A recent study found that the vertical heat transport driven by motions with scales smaller than 0.5 degrees (submesoscales) and frequencies smaller than 1 day(-1)is upward. This transport competes with the other major components of the global heat transport, namely, the downward heat transport explained by the large-scale wind-driven vertical circulation and vertical diffusion at small scales and the upward heat transport associated with mesoscale eddies (50- to 300-km size). The contribution from motions with small spatial scales (<0.5 degrees) and frequencies larger than 1 day(-1), including internal gravity waves, has never been explicitly estimated. This study investigates this high-frequency (subdaily) submesoscale contribution to the global heat transport. The major result of this study, based on the analysis of a high-resolution ocean model, is that including this high-frequency contribution surprisingly doubles the upward heat transport due to submesoscales in winter in the global ocean. This contribution typically concerns depths down to 200-500 m and can have a magnitude of up to 500 W m(-2)in terms of wintertime heat fluxes at 40-m depth, which causes a significant upward heat transport of similar to 7 PW when integrated over the global ocean. Thus, such submesoscale heat transport, which is not resolved by climate models, impacts the heat uptake in the global ocean. The mechanisms involved in these results still need to be understood, which should be the scope of future work.

AB The IPCC has assigned a critical role to negative-CO2-emissions energy in meeting energy and climate goals by the end of the century, with biomass energy plus carbon capture and storage (BECCS) prominently featured. We estimate that methods of combining saline water electrolysis with mineral weathering powered by any source of non-fossil fuel-derived electricity could, on average, increase energy generation and CO2 removal by >50 times relative to BECCS, at equivalent or lower cost. This electrogeochemistry avoids the need to produce and store concentrated CO2, instead converting and sequestering CO2 as already abundant, long-lived forms of ocean alkalinity. Such energy systems could also greatly reduce land and freshwater impacts relative to BECCS, and could also be integrated into conventional energy production to reduce its carbon footprint. Further research is needed to better understand the full range and capacity of the world's negative-emissions options.

AB We report on the first multi-year kilometre-scale global coupled simulations using ECMWF's Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) coupled to both the NEMO and FESOM ocean-sea ice models, as part of the H2020 Next Generation Earth Modelling Systems (nextGEMS) project. We focus mainly on an unprecedented IFS-FESOM coupled setup, with an atmospheric resolution of 4.4 km and a spatially varying ocean resolution that reaches locally below 5 km grid spacing. A shorter coupled IFS-FESOM simulation with an atmospheric resolution of 2.8 km has also been performed. A number of shortcomings in the original numerical weather prediction (NWP)-focused model configurations were identified and mitigated over several cycles collaboratively by the modelling centres, academia, and the wider nextGEMS community. The main improvements are (i) better conservation properties of the coupled model system in terms of water and energy budgets, which also benefit ECMWF's operational 9 km IFS-NEMO model; (ii) a realistic top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) radiation balance throughout the year; (iii) improved intense precipitation characteristics; and (iv) eddy-resolving features in large parts of the mid- and high-latitude oceans (finer than 5 km grid spacing) to resolve mesoscale eddies and sea ice leads. New developments at ECMWF for a better representation of snow and land use, including a dedicated scheme for urban areas, were also tested on multi-year timescales. We provide first examples of significant advances in the realism and thus opportunities of these kilometre-scale simulations, such as a clear imprint of resolved Arctic sea ice leads on atmospheric temperature, impacts of kilometre-scale urban areas on the diurnal temperature cycle in cities, and better propagation and symmetry characteristics of the Madden-Julian Oscillation.

AB Harnessing energy from ocean waves presents a promising solution to combating global climate change in the marine environment, significantly contributing to mitigation efforts, climate enrichment, and decarbonization. This study offers a comprehensive overview of wave energy conversion technologies, focusing on point absorber wave energy converters (PA-WECs) through scientometric and systematic analysis from 2015 to 2024. Data were collected from the Web of Science and Scopus databases, analyzing 1519 research articles and 1518 patents. The study identifies six major knowledge domains based on co-occurring keywords, keyword clusters, and knowledge bursts: wave characteristics, buoy shape optimization, power take-off system design, experimental optimization, WEC arrays, and control strategies. Key findings reveal that oscillating water column technology leads the field with 788 publications and 1027 patents. In contrast, PA-WECs show considerable innovation potential, with 611 publications and 320 patents, particularly in buoy optimization and control strategies. The study includes a gap analysis, identifying critical areas for further research, such as integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning for improved control and monitoring of PA-WEC systems. Challenges like the need for accurate wave climate data, optimized floater geometry, and robust control strategies in extreme weather conditions are addressed. The findings suggest that integrating AI, remote sensing, and machine learning can enhance PA-WEC efficiency, supporting the development of sustainable energy solutions. This study advances the UN SDGs by fostering clean energy innovation (SDG-7), climate resilience (SDG-13), and sustainable use of the oceans (SDG 14)

AB The main purpose of this study is to build a run-up database using an analytical Green's function of 1D fully nonlinear shallow water equations over a uniform constant slope. The total mechanical energy, tsunami run-up height and inundation distance can be quickly derived once a submarine earthquake occurs. Only fast fourier transformation (FFT), multiplication and superposition are employed in the present algorithm.
   The in situ investigations of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and 2011 Tohoku Tsunami are used to validate the present methodology. Most calculated run-up heights are on the safe side and the inundation distance is reasonable. The computational procedure can be efficiently finished within a few seconds so that complete tsunami information can be provided after integrating the existing numerical Green's function database.

ID RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB This research focuses on the development and optimization of a wave-driven electromagnetic energy harvester designed to efficiently capture and store energy from low-frequency ocean waves (<0.3 Hz). The harvester configuration was optimized by adjusting the number of levitating magnets and fixed base magnets to enhance energy conversion. Experiments simulating a sine wave 0.2 Hz demonstrated successfully induced output voltage ranging from 2 to 4 V. This study in magnetic configuration led to observable variations in induced voltage as the repulsive interaction changed between the levitating magnets and base magnets. Performance was evaluated across a range of frequencies (0.05 Hz - 0.3 Hz) to assess the harvester's adaptability to variable wave conditions. To facilitate energy storage, a rectifier and capacitor were integrated into the system, converting and storing the harvested AC energy as DC, allowing the system to store 2.8 V within 5 minutes. Experimental results demonstrate efficient energy harvesting, highlighting the potential for this technology in low-power marine applications. (c) 2025 Author(s).

AB Offshore wind is playing an increasingly important role in our energy mix as it provides the opportunity to increase the penetration of wind energy considerably beyond the current capacity of land-based wind resources. While most planned offshore wind projects consider constructing the wind farms relatively close to the coast, there is vast untapped potential over the open ocean where wind velocities are significantly higher. However, transmitting electricity generated far from shore to onshore demand points is a major challenge since using submarine power cables for long distances can be prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, we consider using offshore wind energy to directly produce green ammonia that can then be transported to shore via ships or pipelines. This is technically feasible since electricity-based production of ammonia only requires water and air as input materials. We perform a comprehensive techno-economic analysis for such green offshore ammonia plants, determining the minimum achievable levelized costs of ammonia for various wind profiles, plant capacities, distances to shore, and water depths. Our results indicate that the proposed approach has the promise to be cost-competitive, especially when considering expected cost reductions in offshore wind turbines in the foreseeable future.

AB Due to the growing global energy needs, renewable energy systems, particularly wave energy converters (WECs), are a feasible solution to satisfy current energy demand. Recently, wave farms with diverse technologies, geometries, and layouts have been developed; however, evaluating the performance of these devices is complicated and requires precise hydrodynamic modeling to efficiently deploy wave farms. This study proposes a multiscenario model using boundary element method (BEM) solver, NEMOH, integrated with evolutionary manyobjective algorithms to evaluate the performance of a multi-axis point absorber WEC with respect to cylindrical, triangular, quadrilateral, and octagonal geometries and varying dimensions, that is, radius, draft, and height. To this end, six objective functions were considered to maximize the energy absorption and significant velocity and to minimize the separation distance, levelized cost of energy, net present value, and q-factor. Accordingly, three EMnO frameworks were utilized: the non-dominated sorings genetic algorithm (NSGA-III), reference pointbased NSGA-III (R-NSGA-III), and multi-objective evolutionary algorithm by decomposition (MOEA/D). The results of the three optimization algorithms indicate that R-NSGA-III converges faster than the other two and also found that the cylindrical and octagonal geometries produce more annual energy among other forms. Comparing the performances of the three different layouts for cylindrical and octagonal geometries reveals that the arrow layout with thirty buoys produced more energy and had a lower levelized cost of energy and net present value.

AB Using the conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation (CNOP) approach, sensitive areas of adaptive observation for predicting the seasonal reduction of the upstream Kuroshio transport (UKT) were investigated in the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). The vertically integrated energy scheme was utilized to identify sensitive areas based on two factors: the specific energy scheme and sensitive area size. Totally 27 sensitive areas, characterized by three energy schemes and nine sensitive area sizes, were evaluated. The results show that the total energy (TE) scheme was the most effective because it includes both the kinetic and potential components of CNOP. Generally, larger sensitive areas led to better predictions. The size of 0.5% of the model domain was chosen after balancing the effectiveness and efficiency of adaptive observation. The optimal sensitive area OSen was determined accordingly. Sensitivity experiments on OSen were then conducted, and the following results were obtained: (1) In OSen, initial errors with CNOP or CNOP-like patterns were more likely to yield worse predictions, and the CNOP pattern was the most unstable. (2) Initial errors in OSen rather than in other regions tended to cause larger prediction errors. Therefore, adaptive observation in OSen can be more beneficial for predicting the seasonal reduction of UKT.

AB Ocean wave energy is one of the most promising clean and renewable energy sources, so developing effective methods to collect such ?random? and ultra-low frequency energy is indispensable. The invention of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) provides new prospects for large-scale blue energy harvesting. In this work, a new spherical TENG based on the coupling of spring-assisted structure and swing structure, integrated with a charge excitation circuit (CEC), was constructed to scavenge water wave energy. The particular structure can transform low-frequency water wave vibrations to high-frequency motions, elevating the frequencies of electrical outputs. Moreover, a TENG array consisting of four TENGs with CECs was fabricated, exhibiting a maximum output power of 16.6 mW and a 205 times enhanced output current of 23.3 mA. The charge excitation TENG array was demonstrated to successfully power a digital thermometer and a wireless signal transmission and reception system without any external power supply. Our study not only provides a new type of TENG with improved performance, but also offers a strategy for constructing maritime internet of things (IoTs) system.

AB This paper introduces wavetrisk-2.1 (i.e. wavetrisk-ocean), an incompressible version of the atmosphere model wavetrisk-1.x with free surface. This new model is built on the same wavelet-based dynamically adaptive core as wavetrisk, which itself uses dynamico's mimetic vector-invariant multilayer rotating shallow water formulation. Both codes use a Lagrangian vertical coordinate with conservative remapping. The ocean variant solves the incompressible multilayer shallow water equations with inhomogeneous density layers. Time integration uses barotropic-baroclinic mode splitting via an semi-implicit free surface formulation, which is about 34-44 times faster than an unsplit explicit time-stepping. The barotropic and baroclinic estimates of the free surface are reconciled at each time step using layer dilation. No slip boundary conditions at coastlines are approximated using volume penalization. The vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity coefficients are computed from a closure model based on turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). Results are presented for a standard set of ocean model test cases adapted to the sphere (seamount, upwelling and baroclinic turbulence). An innovative feature of wavetrisk-ocean is that it could be coupled easily to the wavetrisk atmosphere model, thus providing a first building block toward an integrated Earth system model using a consistent modelling framework with dynamic mesh adaptivity and mimetic properties.

AB This paper presents a novel methodology for site selection of Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) systems, addressing the growing global energy demand and the need for sustainable solutions to climate change. Focusing on the wave energy, a relatively untapped renewable energy source, this research focuses on optimizing the Wave Energy Converter (WEC) deployment amidst the uncertainties of the offshore environment. The study involves a comprehensive evaluation of potential sites, considering key factors like power generation capacity, mooring system fatigue life, and tether response to extreme loads. Initial wave data analysis for various locations is followed by numerical simulations of a point absorber WEC under different environmental conditions. A Bayesian Network (BN) model is then employed to integrate uncertainties into a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM), enhancing the robustness of site selection. This approach facilitates the calculation of utility values for various sites, leading to the identification of the optimal decision alternative based on maximum expected utility. This work provides a detailed framework for renewable energy stakeholders, helping in the assessment of both profitability and survivability of WECs in chosen locations. It significantly contributes to minimizing economic and performance risks associated with ORE system installations, promoting efficient and sustainable energy production from ocean resources.

AB The ultimate fate of CO2 added to the ocean-atmosphere system is chemical reaction with silicate minerals and burial as marine carbonates. The time scale of this silicate weathering negative feedback on atmospheric pCO(2) will determine the duration of perturbations to the carbon cycle, be they geological release events or the current anthropogenic perturbation. However, there has been little previous work on quantifying the time scale of the silicate weathering feedback, with the primary estimate of 300-400 kyr being traceable to an early box model study by Sundquist (1991). Here we employ a representation of terrestrial rock weathering in conjunction with the GENIE (Grid ENabled Integrated Earth system) model to elucidate the different time scales of atmospheric CO2 regulation while including the main climate feedbacks on CO2 uptake by the ocean. In this coupled model, the main dependencies of weatheringrunoff, temperature, and biological productivitywere driven from an energy-moisture balance atmosphere model and parameterized plant productivity. Long-term projections (1Myr) were conducted for idealized scenarios of 1000 and 5000PgC fossil fuel emissions and their sensitivity to different model parameters was tested. By fitting model output to a series of exponentials we determined the e-folding time scale for atmospheric CO2 drawdown by silicate weathering to be approximate to 240kyr (range 170-380kyr), significantly less than existing quantifications. Although the time scales for reequilibration of global surface temperature and surface ocean pH are similar to that for CO2, a much greater proportion of the peak temperature anomaly persists on this longest time scale; approximate to 21% compared to approximate to 10% for CO2.

AB The wind-sea and swell climates in the China Seas are investigated by using the 27-yr Integrated Ocean Waves for Geophysical and other Applications (IOWAGA) hindcast data. A comparison is made between the significant wave height from the IOWAGA hindcasts and that from a jointly calibrated altimetry dataset, showing the good performance of the IOWAGA hindcasts in the China Seas. A simple but practical method of diagnosing whether the sea state is wind-sea-dominant or swell-dominant is proposed based on spectral partitioning. Different from the characteristics of wind-seas and swells in the open ocean, the wave fields in the enclosed seas such as the China Seas are predominated by wind-sea events in respect of both frequencies of occurrences and energy weights, due to the island sheltering and limited fetches. The energy weights of wind-seas in a given location is usually more significant than the occurrence probability of wind-sea-dominated events, as the wave energy is higher in the wind-sea events than in the swell events on average and extreme wave heights are mostly related to wind-seas. The most energetic swells in the China Seas (and other enclosed seas) are 'local swells', having just propagated out of their generation areas. However, the swells coming from the West Pacific also play an important role in the wave climate of the China Seas, which can only be revealed by partitioning different swell systems in the wave spectra as the energy of them is significantly less than the 'local swells'.

AB The efficient and environmentally friendly air conditioning system plays a vital role in cost reduction and efficiency improvement within the shipping industry. This study focuses on a specific ocean-going container ship equipped with the 8S90ME-C10.2 marine diesel engine as its main propulsion system. Firstly, the cooling load of 149.56 kW and a wet load of 18.04 g/s for the container ship were calculated to determine an energy-efficient and comfortable air conditioning scheme. Secondly, a novel combined system, integrating temperature and humidity solution dehumidification with enhanced transcritical CO2 refrigeration using injection subcooling, was proposed. The regenerator for solution dehumidification and the generator for injection refrigeration utilized the main cylinder liner cooling water as a heat source. Based on the system modeling, numerical simulation, and result validation, comprehensive analyses and quantitative evaluations were conducted to investigate the sensitivity of temperature and humidity regulation parameters, system performance, components exergy efficiency, and economics. Finally, employing a multi-objective optimization algorithm, the optimal operating conditions and corresponding objective functions for the system were obtained: exhaust pressure of 9.43 MPa, regeneration temperature of 91.08 degrees C, subcooling degree of 19.48 degrees C, coefficient of refrigeration performance of 3.697, exergy loss of 84.136 kW, and an annual operating cost of $111,300. This combined system exhibits high efficiency, environmental friendliness, and comfort, making it well-suited to handle the fluctuating heat and humidity loads during the ocean-going container ship through varying sea climates.

AB Ocean-based industries like shipping, aquaculture, and wind energy are growing at an unprecedented rate resulting in challenges related to siting and environmental management. As marine aquaculture and other ocean-based industries continue to expand, robust marine spatial planning analyses that reconcile existing ocean uses and integrate pertinent environmental and planning data are critical for identifying compatible locations. In this study, a series of geospatial analyses were used for aquaculture siting within and around a heavily trafficked and highly utilized maritime port in the San Diego Bay area of California, USA. Using a centralized geodatabase representing key aquaculture planning spatial datasets, recommendations for specific areas for aquaculture were developed based on appropriate environmental conditions for candidate shellfish and algae aquaculture species culture systems. Areas that were known constraints were first identified to determine potentially usable areas for shellfish and macroalgae (i.e., seaweed) aquaculture using an exclusion analysis, a type of multi-criteria decision analysis, to eliminate all areas without compatibility. Within the remaining usable area, we further considered shellfish and macroalgae culture system-specific factors within a 'culture systems analysis' to determine where different culture systems have potential for success. This analysis provides a foundation of coastal intelligence for guiding the aquaculture industry and natural resource managers towards appropriate siting decisions. This study can serve as a replicable example of aquaculture spatial planning approaches for siting sustainable aquaculture and other blue economy industries.

To ensure stable communication, two acoustic transducers are mounted at the rear of the glider and optimized to maintain a consistent energy radiation angle despite variations in the glider's attitude. The acoustic modem, housed within one of the compartments, operates with a standby power consumption as low as 5 mW, significantly enhancing the overall energy efficiency of the system. To address the glider's motion dynamics and the unique characteristics of the underwater acoustic channel, a multi-carrier frequency shift keying-based underwater acoustic communication scheme combined with a Stop-and-Wait Automatic Repeat Request protocol was designed and implemented. The system's performance and reliability were validated through sea trials conducted in the South China Sea. The results demonstrated that the glider achieved reliable underwater acoustic communication over distances of up to 5 km. This research highlights the potential of the acoustic underwater glider for applications such as underwater acoustic measurements and distributed networking collaboration. The system holds significant promise for advancing underwater acoustic communication and ocean observation technologies.

AB The populations in Sumhuram (third/second century bce to fifth century ce) and Hamr al-Sharqiya 1 (HAS1) (first millennium bce to first/second century ce) were involved in one of the most important examples of large-scale trade systems in antiquity: the maritime network connecting the coasts of the Indian Ocean. This research focuses on a total of 35 southwestern Arabian and Indian pottery sherds from both the settlements of Sumhuram and Hamr al-Sharqiya 1, analysed through a multi-analytical complementary approach. This study intends to test the input potential of this type of approach applied to ceramics in the context of the Indian Ocean trade network. The techniques adopted are powder X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The results obtained allow the identification of eight distinct groups, each characterized by unique (textural, mineralogical, geochemical) signatures, providing specific clues for determining their provenance, specifically from the Indian subcontinent and southwestern Arabia. This paper shows the importance of this type of archaeometric study that must be integrated into a transdisciplinary approach.

AB Based on theory and climate model experiments, previous studies suggested that most of the uncertainties in projected future changes in meridional energy transport and zonal mean surface temperature can be attributed to cloud feedback. To investigate how radiative and dynamical adjustments modify the influence of cloud-radiative changes on energy transport, this study applies a cloud-locking technique in a fully coupled climate model, CESM. Under global warming, the impacts of cloud-radiative changes on the meridional energy transport are asymmetric in the two hemispheres. In the Northern Hemisphere, the cloud-radiative changes have little impact on energy transport because 89% of the cloudinduced heating is balanced locally by increasing outgoing longwave radiation. In the Southern Hemisphere, on the other hand, cloud-induced dynamical changes in the atmosphere and the ocean cause enhanced poleward energy transport, accounting for most of the increase in energy transport under warming. Our experiments highlight that the local longwave radiation adjustment induced by temperature variation can partially offset the impacts of cloud-radiative changes on energy transport, making the estimated impacts smaller than those obtained from directly integrating cloud-radiative changes in previous studies. It is also demonstrated that the cloud-radiative impacts on temperature and energy transport can be significantly modulated by the oceanic circulation, suggesting the necessity of considering atmospheric-oceanic coupling when estimating the impacts of cloud-radiative changes on the climate system.

AB This paper proposes a novel hybrid underwater vehicle, the Smartfloat, which integrates the concept of buoyancy-driven underwater gliders and conventional profiling floats. The vehicle is presented to address the challenges in ocean monitoring, such as the multidisciplinary observations of long-range transport of the mesoscale features with high spatial-temporal resolution. The vehicle combines the mechanisms of Argo profiling float and the underwater glider, with the application of a special designed attitude control system and the ingenious general arrangement. The vehicle can switch the operating mode between drifting mode and gliding mode. Such a multimodal vehicle would merge the benefits of making measurements in a very energy-efficient way when drifting with the currents in Argo mode, and operating as an underwater glider in glider mode when it is needed to cross the ocean eddies, ocean fronts, filaments, or some stirring regions. In this paper, a proof-of-concept platform including its concept of operations, the main components and subsystems design, and the correlative mathematical analysis is introduced in detail. Experiments in field trials are presented to characterize and illustrate each mode of operation and repeated mode transitions. The results demonstrate the feasibility and the good performance of the proposed vehicle.

AB This study aims to design the onboard waste-to-energy process to dispose waste plastic debris floating in the ocean. Collected marine debris undergoes pretreatment such as freezing and pulverization process. The pretreated plastic waste is transformed into hydrogen through plasma gasification, separation and purification which finally produces electricity by fuel-cell system. The hydrogen separation and purification process consist of water gas shift reaction and pressure swing adsorption process. Lab-scale experiments for the separation and purification process were carried out as a preliminary study prior to designing a practical scale integrated system. For low-temperature water gas shift, Cu-Zn-Al catalyst calcined under nitrogen atmosphere outperformed typical commercial catalysts. Process simulations indicate the need of additional apparatus such as heat exchanger, dehumidifier, and compressor for practical operation of the combined waste-to-energy process. Practical operation window based on the deviation between the ideal performance obtained from simulations and the measured performance from experiments was discussed.

AB Ocean waves have a high potential to become a reference among the renewable energies with economic viability, in the future. Currently, there is in Portugal a Wave Roller technology experimental facility delivering power to the grid. However, Oscillating Water Column (OWC) is the most used technology to capture the energy from the waves. In this paper, a full integrated model of an OWC installation is presented. This model incorporates dedicated models of its components: pneumatic chamber, Wells turbine and Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG). Data to feed the model is taken from Pico (Azores) power plant. The implementation in MATLABO/Simulink0 environment allows to carry on some simulations, regarding the behavior of the OWC system in the presence of pressure increases in the pneumatic chamber (meaning a higher airflow in the turbine). The results allow the conclusion that the speed control feature is crucial to obtain an optimized operation of the system.

AB We present an overview of the UK's Global Sea Ice model configuration version 9 (GSI9), the sea ice component of the latest Met Office Global Coupled model, GC5. The GC5 configuration will, amongst other uses, form the physical basis for the HadGEM3 (Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 3) climate model and UKESM2 (UK Earth System Model version 2) Earth system model that will provide the Met Office Hadley Centre/UK model contributions to CMIP7 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 7). Although UK ocean model configurations have been developed for many years around the NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean) ocean modelling framework, the GSI9 configuration is the first UK sea ice model configuration to use the new native NEMO sea ice model, SI3 (Sea Ice modelling Integrated Initiative). This replaces the CICE (Community Ice CodE) model used in previous configuration versions. In this paper we document the physical and technical options used within the GSI9 sea ice configuration. We provide details of the implementation of SI3 into the Met Office coupled model and the adaptations required to work with our "conductivity coupling" approach and provide a thorough description of the GC5 coupling methodology. A brief evaluation of sea ice simulated by the GC5 model is included, with results compared to observational references and a previous Global Coupled model version (GC3.1) used for CMIP6, to demonstrate the scientific credibility of the results.

AB The Taiwan Strait has recently been proposed as a promising site for dynamic tidal power systems because of its shallow depth and strong tides. Dynamic tidal power is a new concept for extracting tidal potential energy in which a coast-perpendicular dike is used to create water head and generate electricity via turbines inserted in the dike. Before starting such a project, the potential power output and hydrodynamic impacts of the dike must be assessed. In this study, a two-dimensional numerical model based on the Delft3D-FLOW module is established to simulate tides in China. A dike module is developed to account for turbine processes and estimate power output by integrating a special algorithm into the model. The domain decomposition technique is used to divide the computational zone into two subdomains with grid refinement near the dike. The hydrodynamic processes predicted by the model, both with and without the proposed construction, are examined in detail, including tidal currents and tidal energy flux. The predicted time-averaged power yields with various opening ratios are presented. The results show that time-averaged power yield peaks at an 8% opening ratio. For semidiurnal tides, the flow velocity increases in front of the head of the dike and decreases on either side. For diurnal tides, these changes are complicated by the oblique incidence of tidal currents with respect to the dike as well as by bathymetric features. The dike itself blocks the propagation of tidal energy flux.

AB Wave energy is a practical option for the sustainable powering of the drifting buoy beyond solar energy. However, efficient harvesting of wave energy from a complex and dynamic ocean environment for a drifting buoy is significantly challenging, since the buoy's global location and orientation are always in spatiotemporal variation. Herein, we propose a novel multi-DOF wave energy harvesting mechanism that integrates three sets of frequency -tunable harvesting systems into an enclosed drifting buoy, which can greatly enhance the energy harvesting ability of a long-term working drifting buoy that encounters direction -varying and frequency -varying waves. A time -averaged electric power up to 9.18 mW was achieved by a prototype that has a diameter of 45 cm, which is 32.76 % higher than the single-DOF case in sea trials. Additionally, laboratory dry test results show that the prototype provided a power up to 288.76 mW in one direction. This work provides an effective strategy for sustainably generating electricity in the offshore environment for drifting buoys.

AB This article contributes to a growing body of research on the Large Marine Ecosystems Concept. It particularly shines the light on the Guinea Current Large Marine Ecosystem (GCLME), a biodiverse maritime domain providing essential ecosystem services for the survival of a large population while at the same time under intense pressure from both anthropogenic and natural factors. With the need for coordination and cross-border ocean management and governance becoming imperative due to the magnitude of challenges and maritime domain, we examine the factors that underpin ocean governance and those key elements necessary for cross-border ocean governance cooperation in the region. The research draws on qualitative data collected from peer-reviewed literature and documents sourced from different official portals. Three countries in the region (Benin, Nigeria, and Cameroon) are selected as the descriptive and comparative case studies to examine: (i) the factors that drive ocean governance (including geographical features, maritime jurisdictions, political framework, maritime activities, and associated pressures), and (ii) key enabling factors for cross-border ocean governance and cooperation in the GCLME (including marine and coastal related policy and legal framework convergence from international to national including, and shared experiences, common issues and joint solutions). We show that the biophysical maritime features, the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), otherwise known as the Law of the Sea (LOS), inherent political characteristics and the relics of colonization, and increasing ocean use and pressure on the ecosystem make ocean governance challenging in the region. Our analysis also reveals a varying level of convergence on international, regional and national legal, policy and institutional frameworks between the case studies on ocean-related aspects. Significant convergence is observed in maritime security, ocean research, and energy aspects, mostly from countries adopting international, regional and sub-regional frameworks. National level convergence is not well established as administrative and political arrangement differs from country to country in the region. These different levels of convergence help reveal procedural and operational shortcomings, strengths, weaknesses, and functional capability of countries within a cooperative ocean governance system in the region. However, experience from joint-implementation of projects, pre- and post-colonial relations between countries and the availability of transboundary organizations that have mainly emerged due to sectoral ocean challenges would play a crucial role in fostering cross-border ocean governance cooperation in the region.

AB Underwater gliders are energy-efficient vehicles that rely on changes in buoyancy in order to convert up and down movement into forward displacement. These vehicles are conceived as multi-sensor platforms, and can be used to collect ocean data for long periods in wide range areas. This endurance is achieved at the cost of low speed, which requires extensive planning to ensure vehicle safety and mission success, particularly when dealing with strong ocean currents. As gliders are often involved on missions that pursue multiple objectives (track events, reach a target point, avoid obstacles, sample specified areas, save energy), path planning requires a way to deal with several constraints at the same time; this makes glider path planning a multi-objective (MO) optimization problem. In this work, we analyse the usage of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) to tackle a MO glider path planning application on a complex environment integrating 3D and time varying ocean currents. Multiple experiments using a glider kinematic simulator coupled with NSGA-II, combining different control parameters were carried out, to find the best parameter configuration that provided suitable paths for the desired mission. Ultimately, the system described in this work was able to optimize multi-objective trajectories, providing non dominated solutions. Such a planning tool could be of great interest in real mission planning, to assist glider pilots in selecting the most convenient paths for the vehicle, taking into account ocean forecasts and particular characteristics of the deployment location.

AB A double layer bio-inspired self-organizing map (DLBSOM) algorithm for multiple autonomous underwater vehicle (multi-AUV) dynamic task planning to search for multi-targets in the 3-D underwater environments affected by random ocean currents and dynamic uncertainty obstacles is proposed. Combined with a task urgency bio-inspired neural network (TUBNN) model that is applied to construct the neuron activity network to complete initial task assignment and path planning with the constraint of energy consumption. The decoupling of the task assignment and path planning in the initial task planning is solved through the corrected redistribution mechanism and end-to-end trajectory optimization method. The unknown obstacles information is fused with the diamond-shaped local neuronal network constructed by the diamond closed curve function. Through the function curve, the local neuronal network can be precisely adjusted according to AUV operation information and equipment performance to achieve the saving of computing resources and quick processing speed. Subsequently, the distance-speed comprehensive evaluation (DSCE) strategy is used to complete dynamic avoidance decision. By the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GBCO) and the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), the environment is generated to complete multiple sets of simulations that demonstrate the efficiency and adaptability of the DLBSOM algorithm in multi-AUV collaborative search.

AB The interaction of ocean coupling and model physics in the simulation of the intraseasonal oscillation (ISO) is explored with three general circulation models: the Community Atmospheric Model, versions 3 and 4 (CAM3 and CAM4), and the superparameterized CAM3 (SPCAM3). Each is integrated coupled to an ocean model, and as an atmosphere-only model using sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from the coupled SPCAM3, which simulates a realistic ISO. For each model, the ISO is best simulated with coupling. For each SST boundary condition, the ISO is best simulated in SPCAM3.
   Near-surface vertical gradients of specific humidity, Delta q (temperature, Delta T), explain similar to 20% (50%) of tropical Indian Ocean latent (sensible) heat flux variance, and somewhat less of west Pacific variance. In turn, local SST anomalies explain similar to 5% (25%) of Delta q (Delta T) variance in coupled simulations, and less in uncoupled simulations. Ergo, latent and sensible heat fluxes are strongly controlled by wind speed fluctuations, which are largest in the coupled simulations, and represent a remote response to coupling. The moisture budget reveals that wind variability in coupled simulations increases east-of-convection midtropospheric moistening via horizontal moisture advection, which influences the direction and duration of ISO propagation.
   These results motivate a new conceptual model for the role of ocean feedbacks on the ISO. Indian Ocean surface fluxes help developing convection attain a magnitude capable of inducing the circulation anomalies necessary for downstream moistening and propagation. The "processing" of surface fluxes by model physics strongly influences the moistening details, leading to model-dependent responses to coupling.

AB The penetration level of renewable and sustainable energy resources such as geothermal, wind, solar energies and ocean in power generation systems has been increasing. One of the important renewable energy resources is tidal power plants which makes use of rising and falling sea water level. Because of the uncertain nature of the generated power arisen from the variation in the water level in flood and ebb situations, integration of large-scale reservoir-based tidal power plants to power systems can involve numerous types of challenges. Thus, large-scale tidal power plants can be effectively used in operation studies of power systems. For this purpose, a probabilistic approach is introduced in this paper based on the modified PJM technique for integrating the large-scale tidal plant into operation studies of the power system. In this regard, a multi-state reliability model considering both the failure rate of composed components and the variation in the tide levels is developed and used in the operation studies. For evaluation of the impact of the tidal power plant on operation studies of a power system, numerical examples are put forward in which important indices such as unit commitment risk, required spinning reserve and peak load carrying capability can be calculated.

AB The ocean covers approximately 70% of the earth's surface and contains an immense source of renewable energy, in terms of ocean waves. However, this resource is unevenly distributed throughout the world, and so, therefore, converting waves into a useful form of energy will require the identification of potential Wave Energy Farm (WEF) locations. This should be undertaken in tandem with selecting an appropriate Wave Energy Converter (WEC), as the characteristics of these devices are critical in capturing the available wave power. Therefore, this paper describes a three-stage systematic approach that was developed and implemented in order to select the most suitable WEC(s) for marine areas identified as optimal for WEFs. As this sector is evolving rapidly, the first stage identified all WECs currently in development and proposed classifying these devices in a practical and meaningful manner. The second stage developed a procedure for identifying generic WEF locations by integrating the multiple dimensions of sustainable development and the technical limitations of the sector, within a geographic information systems framework. Lastly, the third stage incorporates the results from the previous two stages. The devices considered for further analysis were reduced based on commercial viability, whilst the available power was quantified and characterised at each of the optimal WEF sites. Thereafter, appropriate techno-economic performance indicators were identified to rank and determine the optimal device for a specific location.

AB Green hydrogen production is a promising solution for the effective and economical exploitation of floating offshore wind energy in the far and deep sea. The inherent fluctuation and intermittency of wind power significantly challenge the comprehensive performance of the water electrolysis systems and hydrogen postprocessing systems. Effective coordination with energy storage, including both electricity energy storage and hydrogen energy storage, can mitigate these challenges. Subsea energy storage is an emerging and promising alternative to conventional floating onboard energy storage. In this review, various potential subsea electricity and hydrogen energy storage solutions for 'floating offshore wind + hydrogen' are examined and compared. Many advantages, including security, energy efficiency, economy, lifecycle, and management, can be brought about if the energy storage systems are deployed at the seabed. In particular, integrating intermediate energy storage between the wind farm and hydrogen production plant will allow the expensive electrolyzers to be sized for a high utilization factor and reduce the degradation of electrolyzer performance. Recommendations are provided by analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of these energy storage options. Analysis of policy and market indicates that the period from 2024 to 2030 will be critical for the long-term competition of subsea energy storage with floating energy storage. Overall, subsea energy storage can be a promising enabler for emerging floating offshore wind hydrogen production. This review is intended to arouse extensive discussion and investigation on this topic.

SO JOURNAL OF WATERWAY PORT COASTAL AND OCEAN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID COASTAL OCEAN; GULF; EVOLUTION; MODEL; SCALE; BAY
AB The effects of sea level rise on storm surge energy transformation and flood and ebb current magnitudes are examined in two distinct New Hampshire estuarine systems. The Great Bay estuary is characterized by strong tidal dissipation along a long (13 km) and deep (20-25 m) rocky channel (ebb-dominated Piscataqua River) that connects to a large (flood-dominated) estuarine bay with extensive mudflat areas, whereas the (ebb-dominated) Hampton/Seabrook estuary has minimal tidal dissipation through a short (1 km) and shallow (5-7 m) sandy inlet that connects to an extensive salt marsh with narrow tidal channels. Numerical simulations are conducted using the finite-volume coastal ocean model (FVCOM) with forcing provided by the tides, with and without 0.01 annual exceedance probability storm surge estimated by the North Atlantic Comprehensive Coastal Study (NACCS) and further with and without sea level rise scenarios for year 2060 in Hampton/Seabrook (0.73 m) and 2100 in Great Bay (1.92 m). Results for the Great Bay estuary show that although the maximum sea surface elevation is higher during storm events, upstream linear wave energy loss (about 50%) of the storm surge with and without sea level rise is similar to tidal wave energy loss under present nonstorm conditions. Corresponding depth-integrated currents increase by 10%-30% with sea level rise, 23%-52% with the storm surge, and 32%-97% for the combined event. However, results from the Hampton/Seabrook estuary show that energy loss through the inlet increases from 2% to 4% for no storm and present-day sea level to 30%-40% for storm surge with sea level rise, partially mitigating inland inundation. Depth-integrated current magnitudes in the Hampton/Seabrook inlet increase by a factor of 4 under sea level rise and storm surge. Model results suggest that sea level rise has significant impacts on current speeds in both estuaries and that the energy decay of the tidal wave and storm surge depends on the nature of the estuarine system, with greater change associated with estuaries with shallow, narrow inlets somewhat reducing the effects of inland flooding.

AB Tidal energy, with its predictable and consistent nature, offers a scalable ocean renewable resource that can diversify the energy generation mix for countries with suitable coastal conditions. Accurate tidal current-to- power forecasting is essential to optimize power system management, improve grid stability, and inform the design of power processing and storage units. This study proposes a novel hybrid model integrating Swarm Decomposition with a Multi-Layer Kernel Meta Extreme Learning Machine to forecast non-stationary tidal currents. The Swarm Decomposition isolates key oscillatory components, reducing noise and improving feature extraction, while the kernel-based architecture enhances generalization and scalability by minimizing the need for extensive parameter tuning, resulting in higher forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency. The model is validated on two real-world tidal current datasets from distinct locations, incorporating seasonal variations, and compared against well-established extreme learning machines and deep learning models. A sensitivity analysis of signal decomposition parameters demonstrated their impact on decomposition quality and computational cost. The proposed model outperformed superior performance on both tidal datasets, achieving a 5-fold reduction in mean squared error and increased R2 from 0.9653 to 0.9933. These findings highlight the model's robustness and adaptability to diverse tidal conditions, making it a reliable tool for tidal power forecasting.

AB Unlocking the potential of offshore renewables for green hydrogen (GH2) production can be a game -changer, empowering economies with their visionary clean energy policies, amplifying energy security, and promoting economic growth. However, their novelty entails uncertainty and risk, necessitating a robust framework for facility deployment and infrastructure planning. To optimize offshore GH2 infrastructure placement, this work proposes a novel and robust GIS-based multi -criteria decision -making (MCDM) framework. Encompassing thirtytwo techno-socio-economic-safety factors and ocean environmental impact analysis this methodology facilitates informed decision -making for sustainable and safe GH2 development. Utilizing the synergies between offshore wind and solar resources, this study investigates the potential of hybrid ocean technologies to enhance space utilization and optimize efficiency. To illustrate the practical application of the proposed framework, a case study examining a GH2 system in Australia's marine region and its potential nexus with nearby offshore industries has been conducted. The performed life cycle assessment (LCA) explored various configurations of GH2 production, storage, and transportation technologies. A Bayesian objective weight integrating technique has been introduced and contrasted statistically with the hybrid CRITIC, Entropy, MEREC and MARCOS-based MCDM approaches. Various locations are ranked based on the net present value of life cycle cost, GH2 production capacity, risk, availability, and environment sustainability factors, illustrating their compatibility. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to confirm that a Bayesian approach improves the decision -making outcomes through identifying optimal criteria weights and alternative ranks more effectively. Empowering strategic GH2 decisions globally, the proposed approach optimizes system performances, cost, sustainability, and safety, excelling in harsh environments.

AB The study of hybrid wave energy devices in the ocean environment has become increasingly important. It can serve as an energy absorption device and coastal protection measure. This study comprehensively investigates the hydrodynamic performance of a hybrid structure comprising an array of two oscillating water columns (OWC) integrated with an impermeable semi-circular breakwater (SCBW). The analysis focuses on the influence of wave steepness and wave period under regular and random wave conditions. The center-to-center spacing between the OWC units is maintained at three times the width of an individual OWC. Key performance metrics considered for OWC include the OWC chamber oscillation, air pressure, and capture width (CW). For SCBW, wave run-up and the hydrodynamic pressure exerted on the seaside face are considered. A maximum CW ratio of 2.5 was achieved under regular wave conditions. Additionally, the wave reflection are investigated, and they are found to be a maximum of 0.75, respectively, which are critical for the design and effectiveness of the hybrid structure. The findings indicate that the combined OWC-SCBW system exhibits promising hydrodynamic performance. These results underscore the potential of this hybrid design to contribute significantly to advancements in renewable energy and coastal engineering.

AB Since the mid-1990s, a series of FES (finite element solution) global ocean tidal atlases has been produced and released with the primary objective to provide altimetry missions with tidal de-aliasing correction at the best possible accuracy. We describe the underlying hydrodynamic and data assimilation design and accuracy assessments for the latest FES2014 release (finalized in early 2016), especially for the altimetry de-aliasing purposes. The FES2014 atlas shows extremely significant improvements compared to the standard FES2004 and (intermediary) FES2012 atlases, in all ocean compartments, especially in shelf and coastal seas, thanks to the unstructured grid flexible resolution, recent progress in the (prior to assimilation) hydrodynamic tidal solutions, and use of ensemble data assimilation technique. Compared to earlier releases, the available tidal constituent's spectrum has been significantly extended, the overall resolution has been augmented, and additional scientific byproducts such as loading and self-attraction, energy diagnostics, or lowest astronomical tides have been derived from the atlas and are available. Compared to the other available global ocean tidal atlases, FES2014 clearly shows improved de-aliasing performance in most of the global ocean areas and has consequently been integrated in satellite altimetry geophysical data records (GDRs) and gravimetric data processing and adopted in recently renewed ITRF standards (International Terrestrial Reference System, 2020). It also provides very accurate open-boundary tidal conditions for regional and coastal modelling.

AB Analysis of a global eddy-resolving simulation using the NEMO general circulation model is presented. The model has 1/16 degrees horizontal spacing at the Equator, employs two displaced poles in the Northern Hemisphere, and uses 98 vertical levels. The simulation was spun up from rest and integrated for 11 model years, using ERA-Interim reanalysis as surface forcing. Primary intent of this hindcast is to test how the model represents upper ocean characteristics and sea ice properties.
   Analysis of the zonal averaged temperature and salinity, and the mixed layer depth indicate that the model average state is in good agreement with observed fields and that the model successfully represents the variability in the upper ocean and at intermediate depths. Comparisons against observational estimates of mass transports through key straits indicate that most aspects of the model circulation are realistic. As expected, the simulation exhibits turbulent behaviour and the spatial distribution of the sea surface height (SSH) variability from the model is close to the observed pattern. The distribution and volume of the sea ice are, to a large extent, comparable to observed values.
   Compared with a corresponding eddy-permitting configuration, the performance of the model is significantly improved: reduced temperature and salinity biases, in particular at intermediate depths, improved mass and heat transports, better representation of fluxes through narrow and shallow straits, and increased global-mean eddy kinetic energy (by similar to 40 %). However, relatively minor weaknesses still exist such as a lower than observed magnitude of the SSH variability. We conclude that the model output is suitable for broader analysis to better understand upper ocean dynamics and ocean variability at global scales. This simulation represents a major step forward in the global ocean modelling at the Euro-Mediterranean Centre on Climate Change and constitutes the groundwork for future applications to short-range ocean forecasting.

AB The ocean harbors immense energy with the potential to benefit humanity through judicious utilization, yet concurrently poses threats to marine structures. Traditional approaches have focused on harnessing wave energy or protecting against wave scouring damage individually, often overlooking the dialectical treatment of wave energy. This study introduces a novel concept, aiming to convert wave scouring damage into opportunities for advancing marine structure protection technology through the development of a wave-energy harvesting protective layer. This groundbreaking protective layer integrates an X-shaped triboelectric nanogenerator (X-TENG) with a surface protection coating, effectively buffering wave forces, and converting wave energy into electric energy based on its fundamental role in preventing ion diffusion. Furthermore, the protective layer energizes a cathodic protection system for rebar protection, thereby, providing double-effect protection for marine reinforced concrete through anticorrosion and wave force buffering. Our investigation systematically explores the performance of the X-TENG-based multifunctional protective layer, revealing highly promising results. This breakthrough solution has the potential to revolutionize marine structure protection, offering a sustainable and reliable approach to enhance the operational stability and service life of marine equipment.

AB The oceans cover more than two-thirds of the planet, representing the vastest part of natural resources. Nevertheless, only a fraction of the ocean depths has been explored. Within this context, this article presents the H2020 ENDURUNS project that describes a novel scientific and technological approach for prolonged underwater autonomous operations of seabed survey activities, either in the deep ocean or in coastal areas. The proposed approach combines a hybrid Autonomous Underwater Vehicle capable of moving using either thrusters or as a sea glider, combined with an Unmanned Surface Vehicle equipped with satellite communication facilities for interaction with a land station. Both vehicles are equipped with energy packs that combine hydrogen fuel cells and Li-ion batteries to provide extended duration of the survey operations. The Unmanned Surface Vehicle employs photovoltaic panels to increase the autonomy of the vehicle. Since these missions generate a large amount of data, both vehicles are equipped with onboard Central Processing units capable of executing data analysis and compression algorithms for the semantic classification and transmission of the acquired data.

TI Earth system modeling on modular supercomputing architecture: coupled
   atmosphere-ocean simulations with ICON 2.6.6-rc
SO GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID CLIMATE; KILOMETER; SOFTWARE
AB The confrontation of complex Earth system model (ESM) codes with novel supercomputing architectures poses challenges to efficient modeling and job submission strategies. The modular setup of these models naturally fits a modular supercomputing architecture (MSA), which tightly integrates heterogeneous hardware resources into a larger and more flexible high-performance computing (HPC) system. While parts of the ESM codes can easily take advantage of the increased parallelism and communication capabilities of modern GPUs, others lag behind due to the long development cycles or are better suited to run on classical CPUs due to their communication and memory usage patterns. To better cope with these imbalances between the development of the model components, we performed benchmark campaigns on the Julich Wizard for European Leadership Science (JUWELS) modular HPC system. We enabled the weather and climate model Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) to run in a coupled atmosphere-ocean setup, where the ocean and the model I/O is running on the CPU Cluster, while the atmosphere is simulated simultaneously on the GPUs of JUWELS Booster (ICON-MSA). Both atmosphere and ocean are running globally with a resolution of 5 km. In our test case, an optimal configuration in terms of model performance (core hours per simulation day) was found for the combination of 84 GPU nodes on the JUWELS Booster module to simulate the atmosphere and 80 CPU nodes on the JUWELS Cluster module, of which 63 nodes were used for the ocean simulation and the remaining 17 nodes were reserved for I/O. With this configuration the waiting times of the coupler were minimized. Compared to a simulation performed on CPUs only, the MSA approach reduces energy consumption by 45 % with comparable runtimes. ICON-MSA is able to scale up to a significant portion of the JUWELS system, making best use of the available computing resources. A maximum throughput of 170 simulation days per day (SDPD) was achieved when running ICON on 335 JUWELS Booster nodes and 268 Cluster nodes.

AB Thermodynamics is a science concerning the state of a system, whether it is stable, metastable or unstable, when interacting with the surroundings. Computational thermodynamics enables quantitative calculations of thermodynamic properties as a function of both external conditions and internal configurations, in terms of first and second derivatives of energy with respect to either potentials or molar quantities. Thermodynamic modeling based on the CALPHAD method enables the thermodynamics beyond stable states and is the foundation of Materials Genome and materials design. In last several decades, first-principles calculations based on density functional theory have provided invaluable thermochemical data to improve the robustness of CALPHAD modeling. Today with ever increasing computing power and large amount of data repositories online, it calls for a new paradigm for CALPHAD modeling approach incorporating machine learning to create a sustainable ecosystem for the ocean of data and for emergent behaviors.

AB The interaction mechanisms between the lower part of the atmosphere and the ocean surface comprise of a complicated issue with many parameters to be studied. Heat, moisture and momentum exchanges in the air-sea system exert a significant role on both lower atmosphere and sea state conditions.
   Working towards the understanding of how wave characteristics link the atmosphere with the ocean, an atmospheric model is fully coupled with a wave spectral model. The RAMS/ICLAMS atmospheric model is integrated with the WAM wave spectral model under the OASIS-MCT coupler. The combined modeling system utilizes schemes for ocean surface roughness and sea spray droplet thermodynamics.
   A series of sensitivity tests related to midlatitude cyclones is performed to examine the associated effects of sea state and sea spray impact on wave conditions and lower atmosphere. Under increased wind conditions, sea drag is enhanced as illustrated in the case of the two-way coupling simulations. In addition, increased values of roughness length were traced in near-shore areas in the case of expressions that employ wave parameters such as the wave age. The magnitude and the role of energy yield from sea water droplets depend on the prevailing weather conditions. Sea spray fluxes are amplified in areas with intensified surface winds that also results in an increase of the total heat fluxes. This induces a moistening of the near surface air, an effect in stability profile and an increase of wind speed. The most noticeable impact on marine layer structure emerged close to the first hundred meters. The study revealed an enrichment of the description of the air-sea system through the transition of information between the different models.

AB Shortwave (SW) cloud feedback (SWFB) is the primary driver of uncertainty in the effective climate sensitivity (ECS) predicted by global climate models (GCMs). ECS for several GCMs participating in the sixth assessment report exceed 5K, above the fifth assessment report "likely" maximum (4.5K) due to extratropical SWFB's that are more positive than those simulated in the previous generation of GCMs. Here we show that across 57 GCMs Southern Ocean SWFB can be predicted from the sensitivity of column-integrated liquid water mass (LWP) to moisture convergence and to surface temperature. The response of LWP to moisture convergence and the response of albedo to LWP anti-correlate across GCMs. This is because GCMs that simulate a larger response of LWP to moisture convergence tend to have higher mean-state LWPs, which reduces the impact of additional LWP on albedo. Observational constraints suggest a modestly negative Southern Ocean SWFB- inconsistent with extreme ECS.

AB Carbon dioxide, one of the primary greenhouse gasses leading to global warming, ocean acidification, and climate change is an obnoxious concern. Human dependency on fossil fuels not only spikes the CO2 level but also depletes the limited energy resources. The horrendous impact of carbon footprint has made the reduction of CO2 into solar fuel an indispensable task. The photocatalyst-enzyme integrated artificial system has emerged as a benchmark for CO2 fixation solving both the energy crisis and carbon emission simultaneously. Herein a TBE-Y photocatalyst designed by coupling triptycene (T) with eosin-Y (EY) through Friedel Craft reaction shows excellent solar light harvesting property, high molar extinction coefficient, and appropriate band-gap. The assynthesized 3D polymeric TBE-Y photocatalyst exhibits high NADH regeneration (78.77%) which when consecutively coupled with enzyme (formate dehydrogenase) via electron mediator produces HCOOH (189.34 & mu;mol) from CO2 in high yield in 2 h.

AB To maintain the chance of keeping the average global temperature increase below 2 degrees C and to limit long-term climate change, removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (carbon dioxide removal, CDR) is becoming increasingly necessary. We analyze optimal and cost-effective climate policies in the dynamic integrated assessment model (IAM) of climate and the economy (DICE2016R) and investigate (1) the utilization of (ocean) CDR under different climate objectives, (2) the sensitivity of policies with respect to carbon cycle feedbacks, and (3) how well carbon cycle feedbacks are captured in the carbon cycle models used in state-of-the-art IAMs. Overall, the carbon cycle model in DICE2016R shows clear improvements compared to its predecessor, DICE2013R, capturing much better long-term dynamics and also oceanic carbon outgassing due to excess oceanic storage of carbon from CDR. However, this comes at the cost of a (too) tight short-term remaining emission budget, limiting the model suitability to analyze low-emission scenarios accurately. With DICE2016R, the compliance with the 2 degrees C goal is no longer feasible without negative emissions via CDR. Overall, the optimal amount of CDR has to take into account (1) the emission substitution effect and (2) compensation for carbon cycle feedbacks.

AB The vertical structure of eddies in the Leeuwin Current system affects the eddy volume, heat, and salt transport, even the ecosystem. However, the understanding of eddy vertical structure and eddy-induced transport here are still very limited. In this study, satellite observed sea surface heights were combined with decade-long in situ measurements of Argo floats to study the vertical structure of mesoscale eddies in the LC system and their volume, heat, and salt transport. A novel eddy reconstruction method, which considers the influences of both the eddy and background flow, is devised to study the three-dimensional structure of eddies. Result shows that, in LC system, anticyclonic eddies (AEs) are usually surface-intensified, with the geostrophic velocity decreasing sharply below the mixed layer, while cyclonic eddies (CEs) are subsurface-intensified, with a maximum speed at 240 m. The density anomaly core of the average AE (CE) is at a depth of 130 m (650 m) with a density anomaly of -0.51 (0.24) kg/m(3). The volume-integrated eddy kinetic energy and available potential energy of the average CE are much larger than those of the average AE. The average lifespan of CEs is significantly longer than that of AEs, which can be explained by the deeper vertical scale of CEs. The offshore volume transport by eddy drift across the coastal (107 degrees E) section is 9.05 Sv (12.5 Sv).

AB Natural gas (NG) as a primary energy source plays an important in industrial systems. Natural gas generally needs to be converted into liquified natural gas (LNG) during transportation and stored at a low temperature (around-162 degrees C), which contains a large amount of cold energy that can be used. The discharge of cold energy into the ocean or atmosphere will cause not only energy waste but also environmental pollution. In order to recover LNG cold energy more efficiently, a novel LNG cold energy utilization system integrating Organic Rankine cycle (ORC), transcritical CO2 cycle (TRCC), CO2 energy storage and seawater ice-making cycle and combustion power system is proposed and investigated in this study. Energy analysis and exergy analysis were studied in details. The exergy efficiency and net electric generation (NEG) were analyzed and optimized using the optimizer in Aspen HYSYS. The results reveal that, exergy loss ratio of combustion power system and CO2 energy storage system are relatively larger than that of other subsystems. In addition, The ORC performance of six working fluids was analyzed. The NEG of R290 and R1270 as working fluid of ORC is significantly higher than that of the other four working fluids. Under the condition of basic process simulation, the NEG of ORC and TRCC is 223.7 kW and 216.4 kW, respectively. The total exergy efficiency reaches 39.01 %. After parameter optimi-zation in the optimizer, the total NEG of ORC and TRCC increases by 6.9 % from 440.1 kW to 470.6 kW and the exergy efficiency can reach 39.8 %.

AB Cold Air Outbreaks (CAOs) over shallow seas may lead to dense water formation episodes, enhancing water, heat, nutrient and sediment exchanges across the continental margin, with associated seabed reshaping.
   During winter 2012, a CAO episode characterised by exceptional intensity stroke the northern Adriatic Sea, one of the most effective cool engines driving the Mediterranean circulation, providing a paramount opportunity for an integrated investigation of dense shelf water dynamics.
   In the present study, we describe this event using a fully coupled modeling approach exploring the effects of mutual interactions among atmosphere, ocean currents and sea surface waves, usually not completely accounted for, in the resulting dense water formation.
   Whilst atmospheric fields appear to be marginally affected by coupled dynamics in the present case, implications for sea surface elevation and circulation are far from negligible. Measurements collected in the northern Adriatic Sea showed that a physically consistent description of energy exchanges between ocean and atmosphere provides an improved estimate of heat fluxes and of air and sea temperatures. In addition, the explicit inclusion of wave action within the modeling system further enhances the modulation of air-sea exchanges and the propagation of its effect along the water column, resulting in a different intensity of northern Adriatic gyres and in different water fluxes flowing through the formation basin.
   Through these main controls on the water volume involved in the densification process and on the intensity of momentum input and cooling, a coupled modeling strategy accounting for atmosphere-waves-currents interactions can turn out to be crucial for improving the quantification of thermohaline properties and energy content, newly formed dense water mass, and provide a better description of its migration pathways and rates of off-shelf descent.

AB Variations in ocean mixed layer depth (MLD) show a significant impact on energy balance in the global climate systems and marine ecosystems. At present, the accuracy of modeling MLD, especially in the region with complex ocean dynamics, remains a challenge, thus calling for an emergency using artificial intelligence approach to improve the assessment of the MLD. A novel convolutional neural network model was developed based on a dual-attention module (DA-CNN) to estimate the MLD in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) by integrating multi-source remote sensing data and Argo gridded data. Compared with the original CNN model, the DA-CNN model exhibits superior performance with notable improvements in the annual average root mean square error (RMSE) and R2 values by 13.0% and 8.4%, respectively, while more accurately capturing the seasonal variations in MLD. Moreover, the results using the DA-CNN model show minimum RMSE and maximum R2 values, in comparison to the calculation by the random forest, artificial neural network model, and the hybrid coordinate ocean model. Accordingly, our findings suggest that the newly developed DA-CNN model provides an effective advantage in studying the MLD and the associated ocean processes.

AB Ship voyage optimization provides key theoretical and technical insights for efficient shipping operations. It is critical for developing methodologies and systems that bridge the gaps between the perceived expectations of stakeholders and actual ship operations and for truly applying primary principles and fundamental practices in maritime operations. To develop an advanced and effective shipping voyage optimization system, it is necessary to investigate thoroughly the factors affecting fuel consumption and integrate wisely other aspects, including cargo operation, emissions from fuel consumption, and emission control regulations. The literature on ship voyage optimization is flourishing with the development of green maritime transportation. This paper carefully reviews the latest articles on emission control-driven voyage optimization to investigate the state-of-art and further identify research gaps, ongoing topics, and future research trends.

AB Motivated by the relevance of so-called nonlinear Froude-Krylov (FK) hydrodynamic effects in the accurate dynamical description of wave energy converters (WECs) under controlled conditions, and the apparent lack of a suitable control framework effectively capable of optimally harvesting ocean wave energy in such circumstances, we present, in this paper, an integrated framework to achieve such a control objective, by means of two main contributions. We first propose a data-based, control-oriented, modelling procedure, able to compute a suitable mathematical representation for nonlinear FK effects, fully compatible with state-of-the-art control procedures. Secondly, we propose a moment-based optimal control solution, capable of transcribing the energy-maximising optimal control problem for WECs subject to nonlinear FK effects, by incorporating the corresponding data-based FK model via moment-based theory, with real-time capabilities. We illustrate the application of the proposed framework, including energy absorption performance, by means of a comprehensive case study, comprising both the data-based modelling, and the optimal moment-based control of a heaving point absorber WEC subject to nonlinear FK forces.

AB Estimates of both the human impact on climate as well as the economic impacts of climate change are crucial to inform policy decisions. Econometric modelling allows us to quantify these impacts and their uncertainties, but models have to be consistent with the underlying physics and the time series properties of the data. Here I show that energy-balance models of climate are equivalent to an econometric cointegrated system and can be estimated in discrete time. This equivalence provides a basis for the use of cointegration methods to estimate climate responses and test their feedback. Further, it is possible to use the estimated parameters to quantify uncertainties in integrated assessment models of the economic impacts of climate change. In an application I estimate a system of temperatures, ocean heat content, and radiative forcing including greenhouse gases, and find statistical support for the cointegrated energy balance model. Accounting for structural breaks from volcanic eruptions highlights large parameter uncertainties and shows that previous empirical estimates of the temperature response to increased CO2 concentrations may be misleadingly low due to model-misspecification.

AB Marine Small Modular Reactors (MSMR) integrate SMR technology with ship technology, offering unique value in meeting the energy demands of the open ocean and remote islands. However, the design and construction of MSMR face challenges such as space constraints, complex system integration, and the need to adapt to advanced ship modular construction technologies. Therefore, efficient modular partitioning methods are required to enhance overall efficiency and reliability. The module partitioning of MSMR systems takes into account multiple factors and is a combinatorial optimization problem with performance constraints. This study aims to reflect the internal structure of the system hierarchical tree, provide clear guidance for module partitioning, and improve the computational efficiency of solving combinatorial problems. This paper propose a module division and optimization method for MSMR systems based on fuzzy hierarchical clustering and a genetic algorithm. Initially, the components of the small modular reactor power plant system are clustered into modules of different levels using fuzzy hierarchical clustering. Subsequently, a genetic algorithm is employed to solve the combinatorial optimization problem of the module division scheme, resulting in the optimal division scheme. The feasibility and effectiveness of the method are verified through the modular case of the Radioactive Waste Gas System (WGS). This method can provide guidance for the modularization design of the entire ocean modular reactor system. The method provided in this article can provide a research foundation for future modular design of MSMR and improve design efficiency.

AB Energy sources that may be converted to electric power are elusive at the seafloor. This communication describes the design of a compact benthic microbial fuel cell (BMFC) and a power management platform (PMP) that have been used to recharge lithium-ion batteries with energy harvested in situ from biomass enclosed in the BMFC's anode chamber. The primary power produced was typically between 5 and 50 mW with 42% of the energy transferred to battery storage. The batteries in turn were used to sustain environmental sensors and acoustic communication devices during three experiments in contrasting marine locations. The programmable PMP permitted control of sensor duty cycles and monitoring of BMFC performance. One of the experiments occurred at an ocean depth of 580 m for 1,045 days. It suggested a need for longer lasting biomass supplies to sustain elevated power levels beyond 2-3 years. Based on the lessons learned from these experiments, we conclude that BMFC systems are now sufficiently mature to be applied within marine observing networks. They represent an alternative power source that may be integrated readily with many kinds of innovative sensors.

AB Many impacts projected for a global warming level of 2 degrees C relative to pre-industrial levels may exceed the coping capacities of particularly vulnerable countries. Therefore, many countries advocate limiting warming to below 1.5 degrees C. Here we analyse integrated energy-economy-environment scenarios that keep warming to below 1.5 degrees C by 2100. We find that in such scenarios, energy-system transformations are in many aspects similar to 2 degrees C-consistent scenarios, but show a faster scale-up of mitigation action in most sectors, leading to observable differences in emission reductions in 2030 and 2050. The move from a 2 degrees C-to a 1.5 degrees C-consistent world will be achieved mainly through additional reductions of CO2. This implies an earlier transition to net zero carbon emissions worldwide, to be achieved between 2045 and 2060. Energy efficiency and stringent early reductions are key to retain a possibility for limiting warming to below 1.5 degrees C by 2100. The window for achieving this goal is small and rapidly closing.

AB Offshore wind provides an important source of renewable energy. While wind turbines fixed to the seabed in shallow water have already been industrialized, floating wind turbines are still at an early stage of development. The cost of wind power is decreasing fast. Yet, the main challenges, especially for novel floating wind turbine concepts, are to increase reliability and reduce costs. The reliability perspective here refers to the lifecycle integrity management of the system to ensure reliability by actions during design, fabrication, installation, operation, and decommissioning. The assessment should be based on response analysis that properly accounts for the effect of different sub-systems (rotor, drivetrain, tower, support structure, and mooring) on the system behavior. Moreover, the load effects should be determined so as to be proper input to the integrity check of these sub-systems. The response analysis should serve as the basis for design and managing inspections and monitoring, with due account of inherent uncertainties. In this paper, recent developments of methods for numerical and experimental response assessment of floating wind turbines are briefly described in view of their use to demonstrate system integrity in design as well as during operation to aid inspection and monitoring. Typical features of offshore wind turbine behavior are also illustrated through some numerical case studies.

AB An autonomous surface vehicle, known as a wave glider, was used to record refracted and reflected signals from a seismic source penetrating the shallow subsurface. An integrated survey system consisting of a wave gilder and a human-operated source vessel was deployed. These survey systems are used to acquire wide-offset seismic survey data from specific areas, such as offshore structures. The wave gliders can collect seismic refraction and reflection data, which can be used to estimate subsurface information, e.g., acoustic wave velocity and subsurface structure. We processed raw data collected by a receiver equipped with the wave glider and used the relationship between travel time and offset distance to calculate the velocities of shallow sedimentary deposits and the acoustic basement. The velocities of the sedimentary deposits and basement were estimated to be 1557 and 3507 m/s, respectively. We then overlaid the velocities on subsurface data measured using a single-channel streamer. Our results indicate that unmanned equipment can be used for ocean exploration to aid offshore energy development.

AB This paper investigates an efficient transmission scheme for the remote wireless sensors to receive information which is rarely discussed in the integrated remote wireless sensor and multibeam satellite networks (IWSMSNs). The networks can be employed to exchange sensing information for emergency scenario, ocean scenario, and so on, which are isolated from available terrestrial networks. As the efficient transmission link is important to the IWSMSNs, we propose a hybrid full frequency (HFF) precoding by taking advantage of frequency reuse and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) precoding. Considering energy efficiency and sinks fairness are crucial to transmission link, thus the HFF precoding problems are formulated as transmit power minimization (TPM) and max-min fair (MMF) received signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) problems, which can be transformed to indefinite quadratic optimization programs. Then this paper presents a semi-definite programming (SDP) algorithm to solve the problems for the IWSMSNs. The promising potential of HFF for the real IWSMSNs is demonstrated through simulations.

AB Quality-controlled current observations from a High Frequency radar (HFR) network deployed in the Ebro River Delta (NW Mediterranean) were combined with outputs from IBI operational ocean forecasting system in order to comprehensively portray the ocean state and its variability during 2014. Accurate HFR data were used as benchmark for a rigorous validation of the Iberia-Biscay-Ireland (IBI) regional system, routinely operated in the frame of the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS). The analysis of skill metrics and monthly averaged current maps showed that IBI reasonably captured the prevailing dynamic features of the coastal circulation previously observed by the HFR, according to the moderate resemblance found in circulation patterns and the spatial distribution of eddy kinetic energy. The model skill assessment was completed with an exploration of dominant modes of spatiotemporal variability. The EOF analysis confirmed that the modeled surface current field evolved both in space and time according to three significantly dominant modes of variability which accounted for the 49.2% of the total variance, in close agreement with the results obtained for HFR (46.1%). The response of the subtidal surface current field to prevailing wind regime in the study area was examined in terms of induced circulation structures and immediacy of reaction by performing a conditional averaging approach and a time-lagged vector correlation analysis, respectively. This observations-model synergistic strategy has proved to be valid to operationally monitor the complex coastal circulation in Ebro Delta despite the observed model drawbacks in terms of reduced energy content in surface currents and some inaccuracies in the wind-driven low frequency response.

AB Accurate forecasting of the wave energy is crucial and has significant potential because every wave meter possesses an energy amount ranging from 30 to 40 kW along the shore. By harnessing, it does not produce toxic gases, which is a better alternative to the energies that use fossil fuels. In this research, a multi-stage Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition (MVMD) integrated with Boruta-Extreme Gradient Boosting (BXGB) feature selection and Cascaded Forward Neural Network (CFNN) (i.e., MVMD-BXGB-CFNN) is proposed to forecast daily ocean wave energy in the regions of Queensland State, Australia. The modelling outcomes were benchmarked via three other robust intelligence-based alternatives comprised of Multigene Genetic Programming (MGGP), Least Square Support Machine (LSSVM), and Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT) models hybridized with MVMD and BXGB (i.e., MVMD-BXGB-MGGP, MVMD-BXGB-LSSVM, and MVMD-BXGB-GBDT), and their counterpart standalone CFNN, GBDT, LSSVM, and MGGP models. To develop the multi-step hybrid intelligent systems, first, the primary input signals were simultaneously decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and residual components using the MVMD pre-processing technique. Next, the significant lags at the t-1 and t-2 timescales computed using the cross-correlation function were imposed on the decomposed components and further filtered by the BXGB feature selection to identify the best IMFs and reduce the computational cost and enhance the accuracy. Finally, the filtered IMFs were incorporated into the machine learning (ML) models to forecast the wave energy. Forecasting performance of all the provided models (hybrid and counterpart standalone ones) was evaluated during the testing phase by several well-known metrics, infographic tools, and diagnostic analysis. The results showed that the MVMD-BXGB-CFNN technique, as a capable expert system, outperformed the other hybrid and counterpart standalone methods and has an adequate degree of reliability to forecast the daily wave energy in coastal regions.

AB One important tool at our disposal to evaluate the robustness of Global Circulation Models (GCMs) is to understand the horizontal discretization of the dynamical core under a shallow water approximation. Here, we evaluate the accuracy and stability of different methods used in, or adequate for, unstructured ocean models considering shallow water models. Our results show that the schemes have different accuracy capabilities, with the A- (NICAM) and B -grid (FeSOM 2.0) schemes providing at least 1st order accuracy in most operators and time integrated variables, while the two C -grid (ICON and MPAS) schemes display more difficulty in adequately approximating the horizontal dynamics. Moreover, the theory of the inertia -gravity wave representation on regular grids can be extended for our unstructured based schemes, where from least to most accurate we have: A-, B, and C -grid, respectively. Considering only C -grid schemes, the MPAS scheme has shown a more accurate representation of inertia -gravity waves than ICON. In terms of stability, we see that both A- and C -grid MPAS scheme display the best stability properties, but the A -grid scheme relies on artificial diffusion, while the C -grid scheme does not. Alongside, the B -grid and C -grid ICON schemes are within the least stable. Finally, in an effort to understand the effects of potential instabilities in ICON, we note that the full 3D model without a filtering term does not destabilize as it is integrated in time. However, spurious oscillations are responsible for decreasing the kinetic energy of the oceanic currents. Furthermore, an additional decrease of the currents' turbulent kinetic energy is also observed, creating a spurious mixing, which also plays a role in the strength decrease of these oceanic currents.

AB Leaf reflectance and transmittance spectra are urgently needed in interpretation of remote sensing data and modeling energy budgets of vegetation. The measurement methods should be fast to operate and preferably portable to enable quick collection of spectral databases and in situ measurements. At the same time, the collected spectra must be comparable across measurement campaigns. We compared three different methods for acquiring leaf reflectance and transmittance spectra. These were a single integrating sphere (ASD RTS-3ZC), a small double integrating sphere (Ocean Optics SpectroClip-TR), and a leaf clip (PP Systems UNI501 Mini Leaf Clip). With all methods, an ASD FieldSpec 4 spectrometer was used to measure white paper and tree leaves. Single and double integrating spheres showed comparable within-method variability in the measurements. Variability with leaf clip was slightly higher. The systematic difference in mean reflectance spectra between single and double integrating spheres was only minor (average relative difference of 1%), whereas a large difference (14%) was observed in transmittance. Reflectance measured with leaf clip was on average 14% higher compared to single integrating sphere. The differences between methods influenced also spectral vegetation indices calculated from the spectra, particularly those that were designed to track small changes in spectra. Measurements with double integrating sphere were four, and with leaf clip six times as fast as with single integrating sphere, if slightly reduced signal level (integration time reduced from optimum) was allowed for the double integrating sphere. Thus, these methods are fast alternatives to a conventional single integrating sphere. However, because the differences between methods depended on the measured target and wavelength, care must be taken when comparing the leaf spectra acquired with different methods.

TI UAV-Assisted Data Collection for Ocean Monitoring Networks
SO IEEE NETWORK
LA English
DT Article
AB Ocean monitoring network (OMN) is a remote oceanic data collection system, which integrates communication and networking technologies. As underwater acoustic communication has been widely used for data transmission between battery- powered underwater sensor nodes (USNs) and sink nodes (SNs), an oceanic data collection system requires energy efficient deployment to prolong the lifetime of the whole network. This work aims to propose an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted OMN architecture, in which sensing data are transmitted first from USNs to sea surface SNs in each data collection cycle using underwater acoustic communication, and then a UAV hovering above the SNs collects and relays all the data to a ground base station via wireless communication links. To extend the network lifetime, we model SNs and UAV deployment and resource allocation as a mixed integer non-convex optimization problem. To solve the problem efficiently in a heuristic way, we design a SNs deployment scheme with the help of time division USN-to-SN access and NOMA based SN-to-UAV access schemes. Computer simulations validate the superiority of the proposed deployment and access schemes on OMN lifetime performance. in particular, increasing the number of time slots in the USN-to-SN access process can improve the performance significantly.

AB Integrated water vapor (IWV) is a dominant influence element in radiation absorption, energy transfer, and water circulation on both local and global scales. The Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Imager (OLCI) instrument provides operational IWV measurements using a two-band ratio of an IWV absorption channel (O19; 900 nm) and a referenced channel (O18; 885 nm). However, the operational OLCI/Sentinel-3 satellite product does not offer IWV estimates under cloudy-sky conditions, as OLCI-sensed near-infrared data have considerable uncertainties when clouds are in existence. We develop a practical machine learning-based retrieval algorithm to derive IWV estimates from OLCI near-infrared radiance observations under all-sky conditions. The retrieval method utilizes O19 900-nm and O20 940-nm IWV absorption bands as well as O18 885-nm and O21 1020-nm referenced bands, based on both two-band and three-band ratio methods. IWVs from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) are used as the desired IWV retrievals. The results show that all newly derived IWV retrievals have an excellent agreement with reference IWV from additional GNSS and radiosonde data, regardless of sky weather conditions. The weighted-mean IWV retrievals present the highest performance with GNSS and radiosonde IWV [correlation coefficient: 0.86 and 0.85; root-mean-square error (RMSE): 2.85 and 3.49 mm; and mean bias (MB): -0.14 and -0.99 mm]. The newly retrieved cloudy-sky IWV is comparable to operational clear-sky IWV, denoting the capability and effectiveness of the retrieval algorithm. The retrieval approach exhibits a dependable performance in both spatial and temporal dimensions, which could be employed in other areas and periods.

AB In many remote areas lacking ground communication infrastructure support, such as wilderness, desert, ocean, etc., an integrated edge computing network in the air with edge computing nodes is an effective solution. It can provide over-the-air computing services for ground devices (GDs) with limited computing resources and battery life. In this paper, we study task offloading and resource allocation in the aerial-based mobile edge computing (MEC) system supported by a high altitude platform (HAP) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), with the goal of minimizing the GD's energy consumption. Considering that the task arrival of GDs and wireless communication quality are both stochastic and dynamic, we apply stochastic optimization techniques to transform this task offloading and resource allocation problem into two subproblems, i.e., 1) a subproblem for local computation resource allocation and 2) a subproblem for offloading resource allocation. For the first subproblem, we use convex optimization methods to address it. For the second subproblem, we use game theory to formulate the competition of offloading resources among GDs and propose the Distributed Game-theoretical Multi-server Selection (DGMS) algorithm and the Transmission Power Allocation (TPA) algorithm. Finally, we propose a Distributed Online Task Offloading and Resource Allocation (DOTORA) algorithm and give the theoretical performance analysis of the algorithm. We perform extensive experiments, including the comparison experiments with the UAV-Only and HAP-Only framework, and the comparison experiments with other algorithms under our HAP-UAV framework. The experimental results validate our proposed framework and the DOTORA algorithm.

AB Observationally based atmospheric energy balance is analyzed using Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES)-derived TOA and surface irradiance, Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP)-derived precipitation, dry static and kinetic energy tendency and divergence estimated from ERA-Interim, and surface sensible heat flux from SeaFlux. The residual tends to be negative over the tropics and positive over midlatitudes. A negative residual implies that the precipitation rate is too small, divergence is too large, or radiative cooling is too large. The residual of atmospheric energy is spatially and temporally correlated with cloud objects to identify cloud types associated with the residual. Spatially, shallow cumulus, cirrostratus, and deep convective cloud-object occurrence are positively correlated with the absolute value of the residual. The temporal correlation coefficient between the number of deep convective cloud objects and individual energy components, net atmospheric irradiance, precipitation rate, and the sum of dry static and kinetic energy divergence and their tendency over the western Pacific are 0.84, 0.95, and 0.93, respectively. However, when all energy components are added, the atmospheric energy residual over the tropical Pacific is temporally correlated well with the number of shallow cumulus cloud objects over tropical Pacific. Because shallow cumulus alters not enough atmospheric energy compared to the residual, this suggests the following: 1) if retrieval errors associated with deep convective clouds are causing the column-integrated atmospheric energy residual, the errors vary among individual deep convective clouds, and 2) it is possible that the residual is associated with processes in which shallow cumulus clouds affect deep convective clouds and hence atmospheric energy budget over the tropical western Pacific.

AB Overtopping breakwater systems are among the most promising technologies for exploiting wave energy to generate electricity. They consist in water reservoirs, embedded in piers, placed on top of ramps, higher than sea-level. Pushed by wave energy, seawater fills up the reservoirs and produces electricity by flowing back down through low headhydro turbines. Different overtopping breakwater systems have been tested worldwide in recent years. This study focuses on the Overtopping BReakwater for Energy Conversion (OBREC) system that has been implemented and tested in the harbor of Naples (Italy). The Life Cycle Assessment of a single replicable module of OBREC has been performed for analyzing potential environmental impacts, in terms of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, considering construction, installation, maintenance, and the operational phases. The Carbon Footprint (i.e., mass of CO(2)eq) to build wave energy converters integrated in breakwater systems has been estimated, more specifically the "environmental investment" (i.e., the share of Carbon Footprint due to the integration of wave energy converter) needed to generate renewable electricity has been assessed. The Carbon Intensity of Electricity (i.e., the ratio between the CO(2)eq emitted and the electricity produced) has been then assessed in order to demonstrate the profitability and the opportunity to foster innovation in the field of blue energy. Considering the impact for implementing an operational OBREC module (Carbon Footprint = 1.08 t CO(2)eq; Environmental Investment = 0.48 t CO(2)eq) and the electricity production (12.6 MWh/year per module), environmental benefits (avoided emissions) would compensate environmental costs (i.e., Carbon Footprint; Environmental Investment) those provided within a range of 25 and 13 months respectively.

TI Algorithm for the calculation of the translator position in permanent

ID WAVE ENERGY; SYSTEM
AB A permanent magnet linear generator for direct drive wave energy converters is a suitable power take-off system for ocean wave energy extraction, especially when coupled with a point absorbing buoy via a connection line. The performance of the linear generator is affected by the excursion of the translator along the stator. The optimal stroke is achieved when the midpoint of the oscillations coincides with the center of the stator. However, sea level changes due to, e. g., tides will shift these oscillations. This paper proposes a model able to detect the position of the translator from the generator output voltage. The algorithm will be integrated in the control system of a mechanical device that adjusts the length of the connection line in order to center the average position of the translator with the center of the stator. Thereby, the output power from the wave energy converter increases, and the mechanical stresses on the hull of the generator decrease. The results obtained by the model show good agreement with the experimental results from two linear generators, L2 and L3, deployed in the Lysekil wave energy research site, Sweden. The theoretical results differ from the experimental results by -4mm for L2 and 21mm for L3 with a standard deviation of 27mm and 31 mm, respectively. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB The combined offshore wind and wave energy on an integrated platform is an economical solution for the offshore energy industry as they share the infrastructure and ocean space. The study presents the dynamic analysis of the Submerged Tension-Leg Platform (STLP) combined with a heaving-type point absorber wave energy converter (WEC). The feasibility study of the hybrid concept is performed using the aero-servo-hydro-elastic simulation tool FAST. The study analyzes the responses of the combined system to understand the influence of the WECs on the STLP platform for various operating conditions of the wind turbine under regular and irregular waves. Positive synergy is observed between the platform and the WECs, and the study also focuses on the forces and moments developed at the interface of the tower and platform to understand the effect of wind energy on the turbine tower and the importance of motion amplitudes on the performance of the combined platform system. The mean and standard deviation for the translation and rotational motions of combined wind and wave energy converters are determined for different sea states under both regular and irregular waves to analyze the change in responses of the structure. The study observed a reduction in motion amplitudes of the hybrid floating system with the addition of the wave energy converters around the STLP floater to improve the energy efficiency of the hybrid system. The study helps in understanding the best possible arrangement of point absorber-type wave energy converters at the conceptual stage of the design process.

AB With the development of marine exploitation, ocean robots pose a great challenge to traditional battery power supply, scavenging green and sustainable energy from the ocean environment to improve duration time and operation range has become a feasible solution. Herein, a self-powered underwater glider using a bidirectional swing-rotation triboelectric-electromagnetic hybrid nanogenerator (BSR-HNG) has been fabricated to harvest energy from water waves. A mechanical rectification method using a novel gear escapement mechanism is introduced to rectify irregular low-frequency wave excitation into the stable high-frequency rotation, enabling the BSR-HNG to operate stably even at an excitation frequency of 0.1 Hz. Compared to traditional swing-rotation nanogenerators using one-way bearing, the BSR-HNG utilizes symmetrically arranged gear escapement mechanisms to convert bidirectional swing into unidirectional rotation. With the optimized design, the average output power generated in one cycle increases by 48%, and the peak power of the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and electromagnetic nanogenerator (EMG) at 0.8 Hz reaches about 0.4 mW and 0.12 W, respectively. Furthermore, a commercial thermometer and a calculator are utilized to demonstrate the high performance of the BSRHNG in a simulated wave environment. The BSR-HNG is also integrated into the underwater glider as a power source, and a depth-sensor in the underwater glider is successfully powered by BSR-HNG, which provides a new solution to improve the endurance of marine robots.

TI Baroclinic Coupling Improves Depth-Integrated Modeling of Coastal Sea
   Level Variations Around Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS

ID GLOBAL OCEAN; SURGE; WAVES; TIDES; SURFACE; SCALE
AB This study applies a baroclinic-coupled depth-integrated modeling system to the North Atlantic Ocean, where an unstructured mesh is used to focus resolution down to similar to 30m along the coasts of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Ocean baroclinicity is incorporated through one-way coupling from operational data-assimilated Global Ocean Forecasting System 3.1 temperature and salinity fields at just 12% additional computational time. The main objectives are to provide a comprehensive analysis of observed and modeled coastal sea levels (spanning from seasonal to supertidal variations) in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands during 2017 and to evaluate the associated model performance with and without baroclinic coupling at 14 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Ocean Service tide gauges deployed in the region. It is found that baroclinic coupling increases modeled energy across the entire frequency spectrum, which is more commensurate with observations. In particular, density-driven effects such as the seasonal cycle and sea level setdown due to trailing cold wakes from passing hurricanes are largely reproduced. Supertidal shelf-resonant seiching at one to two cycles per hour is observed and modeled at a number of locations, where excitation of these modes is often promoted by the baroclinic coupling. Baroclinicity improves the yearlong model skill at every tide gauge, where the mean total skill is increased from 87% to 93% accuracy (54% to 85% for the nontidal residual). In September 2017 during Hurricanes Irma and Maria, baroclinicity increases model skill at 10 out of 14 tide gauges even when the barotropic mode is adjusted to have no mean offset from the observations.
   Plain Language Summary Computer simulations (models) with fine scales at the coast are required to accurately forecast coastal water levels potentially causing flooding. Often these computer models only account for the effects of winds and air pressure (creating surge), and gravity from the Moon and the Sun (creating tides), ignoring the effects of ocean density because of the large computational expense required. In this study we present an approach to incorporate ocean density effects into the fine-scale model by using information from an existing coarse-scaled ocean model already in operation. This results in a small and manageable 12% increase to computational run-times. The approach is assessed by comparing model results to measured coastal sea levels during 2017 around Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It is found that a range of density-induced variations in coastal sea levels could be reproduced such as those related to seasonal heating-cooling cycles, and temporary cooling of the local ocean surface due to 2017 Hurricanes Maria and Irma. Measures of model accuracy show that the inclusion of ocean density leads to improvements in the simulation of yearly coastal water levels at every location tested. Based on the positive results this approach may be useful for improving existing operational forecast computer simulations.

TI Use of a Compliant Tether to Decouple Observation Buoy Motion for
   Auxiliary Wave Power
SO MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB With the growth of the Blue Economy, the volume of data collection within the ocean environment has been rapidly increasing. Larger numbers of oceanograph-ic, meteorological, and floating Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) buoys have been collecting high fidelity measurements while pushing against power budget limits. Power limitations lead to infrequent transmission of reduced data sets or recording data to local storage that must be physically collected when the buoy is serviced. Triton Systems, Inc. and its partners are developing a retrofittable wave energy converter (WEC) to provide auxiliary power to these observation buoys to increase mission duration and power budget, improve reliability, and reduce the need for service trips. One of the greatest challenges has been developing a meth-od to interface Triton's WEC with these buoys without impacting measurement fidelity. This is especially critical for inertial wave and LiDAR wind measurements collected with sensors that could be adversely affected by additional buoy dynam-ics introduced by an integrated WEC. To address this, Triton and EOM Offshore developed a compliant tether to pair an observation buoy with a floating WEC while decoupling relative motion. Based on EOM's proven stretch hose technol-ogy, this compliant tether transmits power and data between the buoy-WEC sys-tem. Modeling shows that the system has the potential to minimally adversely affect oceanographic, meteorological, wind resource characterization, and other measurements, with future testing scheduled to validate modeling efforts. Keywords: wave energy, ocean observing, LiDAR buoy, wind resource character-ization, offshore wind energy

AB The last decade has seen a worldwide increase in the use of alternative energy sources, especially renewable energy (RE), including its application in desalination. In the past many experimental and pilot investigations were presented which allowed the costs and effectiveness of such integrated solutions to be estimated. The present review describes experience related to the use of solar thermal technologies (solar collector and concentrated solar power technologies), solar electricity (photovoltaic and concentrator photovoltaics), wind, hydroelectric (hydropower, tidal, wave and ocean thermal energy), biomass and geothermal energy (power and thermal) as well as hybrid systems. The costs relating to energy and desalinated water production are investigated in the case of various technological processes used in desalination. The main directions for development of the RE systems investigated are discussed and their advantages and disadvantages are assessed. Such a comprehensive review showed that the expansion of the effective use of RE sources is still hampered by several techno-economic aspects. The paper focuses on the main concerns of the need to optimise energy processes, especially by creating more energy-efficient and economically effective solutions, energy storage, energy recovery and the expansion of off-grid systems. As a result of the analysis it was concluded that, despite some disadvantages, the combining of RE with desalination processes requires further intensive research and demonstration units for longer term performance. Regulations to develop less energy-intensive desalination technologies are also still needed.

AB Marine Internet of Things (IoT) systems have grown substantially with the development of nonterrestrial networks (NTNs) via aerial and space vehicles in the upcoming sixth-generation (6G), thereby assisting environment protection, military reconnaissance, and sea transportation. Due to the unpredictable climate changes and the extreme channel conditions of maritime networks, however, it is challenging to efficiently and reliably collect and compute a huge amount of maritime data. In this article, we propose a hybrid low-Earth orbit (LEO) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) edge computing method in space-air-sea integrated networks for marine IoT systems. Specifically, two types of edge servers mounted on UAVs and LEO satellites are endowed with computational capabilities for the real-time utilization of a sizable data collected from ocean IoT sensors. Our system aims at minimizing the total energy consumption of the battery-constrained UAV by jointly optimizing the bit allocation of communication and computation along with the UAV path planning under latency, energy budget, and operational constraints. For availability and practicality, the proposed methods are developed for three different cases according to the accessibility of the LEO satellite, "Always On," "Always Off," and "Intermediate Disconnected," by leveraging successive convex approximation (SCA) strategies. Via numerical results, we verify that significant energy savings can be accrued for all cases of LEO accessibility by means of joint optimization of bit allocation and UAV path planning compared to partial optimization schemes that design for only the bit allocation or trajectory of the UAV.

AB While the technology now exists to harvest wave energy in coastal regions, the capital expenditures for wave farms can be substantial, so it is important to be able to simulate the power in advance. Further, to integrate wave energy into the grid, utilities need to forecast over short horizons and calculate reserve requirements. Wave farms are simulated at three locations in British Columbia, Canada. Power series are calculated for six types of wave energy converters (WECs), four that operate in deep water, and two in shallow water. Forecasts are run using a physics-based model and statistical models. Five major conclusions emerge from the analysis. First, given the intermittency of buoy data, physics model hindcasts are an effective method of interpolating missing values. Second, the power output from converters does not have the same properties as the wave energy flux. Instead, the power output is a nonlinear function of the wave height and period, with fewer large outliers. Third, time series models predict well over near-term horizons while physics models forecast more accurately over longer horizons. The convergence point, at which the two types of models achieve comparable degrees of accuracy, is in the area of 2-3 h in these data sets, lower than in most prior studies. The recommendation is to use time series methods to forecast at the horizons required for reserves, and physics models for long-term planning. Fourth, the predictability of the power output can differ substantially for individual converters. Finally, wave energy is found to be significantly less costly in terms of reserves than wind and solar. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Prediction of severe natural hazards requires accurate forecasting systems. Recently, there has been a tendency towards more integrated solutions, where different components of the Earth system are coupled to explicitly represent the physical feedbacks between them. This study focuses on rapidly developing waves under extratropical storms to understand the impact of different wave source term parameterisations in the WAVEWATCH III (WWIII) model (ST4 and ST6) and coupling strategies (surface roughness closure versus surface stress closure) on the accuracy of the Met Office regional atmosphere-ocean-wave coupled research system for the north-west (NW) European shelf (UKC4). Results of a study focused on simulations during winter 2013/14 demonstrate that ST6 allows for a faster wave growth than the ST4 parameterisation but might degrade low to mid energy wave states. The difference between ST6 and ST4 in wave growth is larger for higher wind speeds and short fetches. The experiment with ST4 and roughness closure consistently under-predicts the wave growth in those locations where fetch dependence is an important factor (i.e., seas at the East (E) of Ireland and the UK for storms coming from the NW-WNW). The implementation in the wave model of ST6 physics with the stress closure coupling strategy appears to improve growth of young wind-seas, reducing bias in those locations where the storms are underestimated. The slower wave growth when using surface roughness closure seems to be related to an underestimation of the momentum transfer computed by the wave model when coupling the wind speeds. For very young to young wind seas, this can be overcome when the surface stress is computed by the atmospheric model and directly passed to the ocean.

AB A high-resolution coupled ocean atmosphere model is used to study the effects of seasonal re-emergence of North Atlantic subsurface ocean temperature anomalies on northern hemisphere winter climate. A 50-member control ensemble is integrated from 1 September 2007 to 28 February 2008 and compared with a parallel ensemble with perturbed ocean initial conditions. The perturbation consists of a density-compensated subsurface Atlantic temperature anomaly corresponding to the observed subsurface temperature anomaly for September 2010. The experiment is repeated for two atmosphere horizontal resolutions (similar to 60 km and similar to 25 km) in order to determine whether the sensitivity of the atmosphere to re-emerging temperature anomalies is dependent on resolution. A wide range of re-emergence behavior is found within the perturbed ensembles. While the observations seem to indicate that most of the re-emergence is occurring in November, most members of the ensemble show re-emergence occurring later in the winter. However, when re-emergence does occur it is preceded by an atmospheric pressure pattern that induces a strong flow of cold, dry air over the mid-latitude Atlantic, and enhances oceanic latent heat loss. In response to re-emergence (negative SST anomalies), there is reduced latent heat loss, less atmospheric convection, a reduction in eddy kinetic energy and positive low-level pressure anomalies downstream. Within the framework of a seasonal forecast system the results highlight the atmospheric conditions required for re-emergence to take place and the physical processes that may lead to a significant effect on the winter atmospheric circulation.

AB Reforecasts produced by the ECMWF Integrated Forecast System (IFS) were used to study heating and moistening processes associated with three MJO events over the equatorial Indian Ocean during the Dynamics of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (DYNAMO) field campaign. Variables produced by and derived from the IFS reforecast (IFS-RF) agree reasonably well with observations over the DYNAMO sounding arrays, and they vary smoothly from the western to eastern equatorial Indian Ocean. This lends confidence toward using IFS-RF as a surrogate of observations over the equatorial Indian Ocean outside the DYNAMO arrays. The apparent heat source Q(1) and apparent moisture sink Q(2) produced by IFS are primarily generated by parameterized cumulus convection, followed by microphysics and radiation. The vertical growth of positive Q(1) and Q(2) associated with the progression of MJO convection can be gradual, stepwise, or rapid depending on the event and its location over the broader equatorial Indian Ocean. The time for convective heating and drying to progress from shallow (800 hPa) to deep (400 hPa) can be <1 to 6 days. This growth time of heating and drying is usually short for convective processes alone but becomes longer when additional microphysical processes, such as evaporative moistening below convective and stratiform clouds, are in play. Three ratios are calculated to measure the possible role of radiative feedback in the MJO events: amplitudes of radiative versus convective heating rates, changes in radiative versus convective heating rates, and diabatic (with and without the radiative component) versus adiabatic heating rates. None of them unambiguously distinguishes the MJO from non-MJO convective events.

   path planning; Nonlinear model predictive control
ID HAINAN
AB Ocean fronts are the boundaries where distinct water masses meet. This process involves energy exchange and nutrient transport that both are of significant interest for the marine research. This paper considers using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to sample, plan, control, and reconstruct the front autonomously. To achieve the task, an integrated reconstruction, path planning, and control framework is proposed with Bayesian optimization and nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). The integration lies in that the performances of front reconstruction and AUV path tracking influence each other. Particularly, differing from the traditional predetermined or rule-based sampling pattern, a Bayesian optimization scheme is proposed without defining a temperature detection threshold for ocean fronts. During each iteration of the Bayesian optimization, the Gaussian process regression is performed first to reconstruct the temperature field of the front region in a data-driven way. Next, an acquisition function characterizing the possible location of the front is maximized to generate a series of waypoints. Those waypoints are further converted into Zig-zag-like smooth reference paths of the AUV. This ensures that the vehicle moves in the region of interest. Then, with the line-of-sight guidance law, we derive the AUV error dynamics model based on which an NMPC controller is proposed unifying the online planning and control considering system constraints explicitly. The goal is to achieve high path-tracking accuracy which also means high-value front regions can be visited by the AUV. Monto Carlo simulations are carried out with high-fidelity data from regional ocean models. It is illustrated that the AUV deployed in the front region can accomplish the autonomous sampling, reconstruction, and tracking tasks with satisfactory efficiency and precision. The proposed method has superior reconstruction and tracking accuracy performance than several classic methods.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to disseminate the lessons learned from the successful deployment of a wave energy converter (WEC) and accelerate growth in the field of ocean energy.
   Design/methodology/approach - A thorough, well structured, documented, industrial approach was taken to the deployment because of the depth and scale of the task required. This approach is shown throughout the paper, which reflects the importance of a comprehensive project plan in success as well as failure.
   Findings - The findings demonstrate the viability of the use of off shore WEC to generate electricity and that such a project can be completed on time and on budget.
   Research limitations/implications - The research implications of the paper include the importance of an enhanced, integrated supervisory system control in terms of efficiency, operation and maintenance, and long-term viability of WECs. This paper can be used to help guide the direction of further research in similar areas.
   Practical implications - The practical implications include proof that WEC deployments can be carried out both on time and under budget. It highlights much of the practical data collected throughout the course of the project and presents it so that it might be used as a guide for future projects.
   Originality/value - At the time of this paper, successful deployment of off shore WECs has been a rare accomplishment. Because the project was publicly funded, the data collected during this project, both technical and practical, is freely available.

AB This paper describes the design of a deep-sea chemical data collector for a seafloor observatory network. The control system of the data collector comprises the main control unit, energy supply distribution unit, serial port expansion unit, condition monitoring, power supply switching unit, and communication unit. The functions of the data collector include self-inspection, diagnosis, and isolation. It also transmits the collected data and the monitoring data in the data collector cabin to the shore station management system in real-time. The data is transmitted through the secondary junction box and the photoelectric composite cable. The data collector also includes optical dissolved oxygen, deep-sea methane, chlorophyll, turbidity, and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) sensors. In January 2017, the data collector integrated with domestic chemical sensors was used for the sea trial, in Jiaozhou Bay, Qingdao. The experimental results demonstrate the reliability of the system and the data quality of all chemical parameters.

AB Free-space optics (FSO) and visible light communication (VLC) share the same optical wireless features, such as high data rate, license free, energy efficient, flexible access, and high degree of security. A hybrid optical wireless network based on FSO/VLC heterogeneous interconnection is presented here for future space-air-ground-ocean-integrated communication architecture, especially in the radio-frequency-sensitive (RF) or security-required environments. The functional modules of the hybrid network coordinator are defined, along with the implementation and deployment details. Three fundamental network-layer mechanisms are designed in the coordinator including user identification and localization, user mobility and handoff control, and routing and traffic management. An experimental platform is built to evaluate the transmission performance of the presented hybrid network, and a complete data aggregation/transmission/distribution procedure based on heterogeneous interconnection is first realized, which includes two-segment 1.0-m 450-Mb/s orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing-based VLC transmissions interconnected by one-segment 430-m 0.96-Gb/s on-off keying (OOK)-based nonturbulent FSO transmission, with the bit error rate under the forward-error-correction limit (3.8 x 10(-3)). The VLC transmission performances under three speed levels and FSO transmission performances under five typical air-quality conditions are experimentally demonstrated, which validate the feasibility of the proposed hybrid optical wireless network.

AB The seriousness of the global climate crisis makes the path towards the decarbonization of societies irreversible. In response to this call for action, the entire power system community has been actively researching, proposing, and implementing measures to minimize the share of emissions. Instigated by ambitious (EU) legislation, increasing public awareness of the problem, and the competitiveness of PV and onshore wind technologies, the past two decades have seen several EU countries paving the way towards large-scale penetration of renewables, such as Portugal and Spain, where the share of renewables has grown by leaps and bounds. As this process has unfolded, the large scope of challenges posed by integrating these two technologies requires further debate. These include technical and conceptual aspects of the infrastructure, such as an increasing number of grid connections, lack of inertia, power balancing issues derived from the stochastic nature of renewables, and issues of market participation and fairness. Notwithstanding, this has also "opened the door"to a broad range of solutions that can effectively tackle the lack of system flexibility. Among them, the Iberian Peninsula is a privileged spot to invest in promising renewable energy sources with attractive energy densities to complement the existing portfolio, namely ocean, offshore wind, and hydrogen technologies. Hence, this study analyzes and discusses this transformative process, promotes a better understanding of its challenges, and provides guided policy suggestions to move forward while preserving the security and resilience of the system.

AB The land-surface developments of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) are based on the Carbon-Hydrology Tiled Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land (CHTESSEL) and form an integral part of the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), supporting a wide range of global weather, climate and environmental applications. In order to structure, coordinate and focus future developments and benefit from international collaboration in new areas, a flexible system named ECLand, which would facilitate modular extensions to support numerical weather prediction (NWP) and society-relevant operational services, for example, Copernicus, is presented. This paper introduces recent examples of novel ECLand developments on (i) vegetation; (ii) snow; (iii) soil; (iv) open water/lake; (v) river/inundation; and (vi) urban areas. The developments are evaluated separately with long-range, atmosphere-forced surface offline simulations and coupled land-atmosphere-ocean experiments. This illustrates the benchmark criteria for assessing both process fidelity with regards to land surface fluxes and reservoirs of the water-energy-carbon exchange on the one hand, and on the other hand the requirements of ECMWF's NWP, climate and atmospheric composition monitoring services using an Earth system assimilation and prediction framework.

AB This paper presents elite group-based evolutionary algorithms (EGEA) for adaptive ocean sampling using multiple unmanned marine vehicles (UMVs). The EGEA integrate a group-based framework and elitist selection methods into evolutionary path planner, which combine main advantages of these two techniques.The group-based framework allows each offspring individual of evolutionary algorithm to generate its own group of new solutions with a certain probability. Two elitist selection methods, herein referred to as group individual elitist selection (GIES) and whole population elitist selection (WPES), are proposed to facilitate selecting preferable solutions to be passed on to the next generation in the procedure of evolutionary algorithms. The EGEA path planners based on simulated annealing algorithm (SA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are tested to find trajectories for multiple UMVs to collect maximum interested ocean information from regions under investigation. The mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is also described and evaluated with the proposed EGEA for solving the adaptive sampling problem. Simulation results show that the whole elite group-based simulated annealing algorithm (WEGSA) is able to generate trajectories with more information gain from regions of high scientific interest with constrained energy of multiple UMVs than other techniques. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the inherent robustness and superiority of the proposed planner based on the EGEA in comparison with other techniques.

AB When an offshore wind farm is designed, the available ocean space limits the overall farm's output. Conse-quently, over the last few decades, the density of turbines has increased, which in turn intensified the aero-dynamic interactions between the turbines. The interaction is a consequence of the farm layout, which is affected by the macro siting and micro siting optimization concerns. However, existing optimization approaches cannot satisfy the complicated offshore condition. To provide a more competitive cost, this paper proposes an advanced optimization approach that combines fluid mechanics methods and mathematical models to analyze the optimal array layout of large offshore wind farms. First, to obtain the maximum power generation, we propose an in-tegrated interference model to describe the aerodynamic interaction between any two adjacent turbines. Second, we study the changing relation of the layout of wind turbines and the power generation of the system. Third, we investigate three different scenarios with aligned and staggered layouts under different wind conditions. We also perform an extensive sensitivity analysis on the influence of the occurrence probabilities of multiple prevailing wind directions on the power efficiency of wind farms. Finally, we suggest some policies to support the market development.

AB The generation and propagation of meteorological tsunamis (meteotsunamis) were numerically investigated in coastal waters of Buenos Aires Province. This study was carried out using a vertically integrated ocean model driven by a theoretical atmospheric forcing. This forcing simulates a train of nondispersive atmospheric gravity waves (AGW) propagating within a bounded area that moves at the speed of the synoptic systems. Firstly, a study case of simultaneous AGW and meteotsunami activity was simulated to validate the implemented methodology. Subsequently, after several numerical experiments, it was obtained that the amplitude, the dominant period, and the direction of propagation of the AGW train were the parameters that have the largest impact on the simulated meteotsunami amplitude. Maximum meteotsunami wave height (0.85 m) was obtained at Punta Rasa (the northern extreme of the coast of Buenos Aires Province) when the AGW reached this location. Numerical outcomes also showed that the meteotsunamis would propagate like ocean edge waves. In these cases, the continuous transference of energy from the atmosphere to the ocean could be possible (Greenspan resonance). Even though the implemented theoretical forcing is realistic, the numerical experiments revealed that some particular issues should be enhanced to better simulate the genesis and propagation of the meteotsunamis in coastal waters of the Buenos Aires Province. These issues are analyzed and discussed in this paper.

AB Floating offshore wind (FOW) farms are key in meeting Europe's renewable energy targets, harnessing wind energy from waters 60 m or deeper, where bottom-fixed farms are unfeasible. Additionally, floating structures allow for the installation of larger turbines than stationary farms, which in turn leads to a greater energy output. However, cable failures dramatically impact the energy transmission from the farms and cause most of the financial losses. Monitoring and maintenance tasks are challenging due to the harsh ocean conditions. The FLoating Offshore Wind turbine CAble Monitoring (FLOW-CAM) project, supported by European Union's HORIZON 2020 programme, studies the structural health monitoring (SHM) of defects in the power cables of the FOW farms which encompass inspection and detection applications. An SHM system integrated with a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) was developed for underwater inspection and maintenance, supporting collection and presentation of essential data through an advanced interface. Part I details the technologies and methods used in this research.

AB The research focuses on a uniquely designed three-compartment type integrated electrochemical reactor developed in a laboratory setting. This innovative reactor uses an electrolytic cation exchange technique to extract substantial quantities of carbon dioxide from ocean water as bicarbonate and carbonate while simultaneously producing hydrogen gas for potential hydrocarbon production. The study employs the Design Expert software package to evaluate and optimize the implementation of electrochemical carbon dioxide extraction from ocean water. The reactor is divided into three compartments by two cation-exchange membranes: a middle part and two electrode parts for the cathode and anode sides. The membranes possess acidic properties that facilitate cation transport while inhibiting anion transport. The laboratory studies, including 35-minute long experimental runs, are conducted to determine the system's feasibility by assessing carbon dioxide extraction under different conditions, such as electrolyte concentration, applied voltage, and pH levels. The reactor achieves a maximum COQ extraction rate of 1479.73 mg/min, with optimal conditions yielding 1514.6 mg/min. The ideal operating parameters are found to be a voltage of 14.8 V, an electrolyte concentration of 0.557 M, and a pH of 2.26. The results of the optimization study further reveal that carbon dioxide extraction increases with decreasing pH levels.

AB Various forms of high-entropy energy (HEE), such as wind energy, ocean tidal energy, mechanical vibrations, and human motion, are widely distributed in nature and our surroundings. Effectively harvesting and utilizing these forms of energy has become a promising solution to address the challenges of sustainable energy development. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), with their unique advantages in harvesting low-frequency and micro-amplitude mechanical energy, have emerged as a key technology in the field of distributed energy systems and have attracted significant academic attention in recent years. However, to expand the application scenarios of TENGs, it is essential to continuously explore methods for improving their output performance. To meet the high-voltage output requirements of electrochemical applications, we developed a specialized electrochemical triboelectric nanogenerator (EC-TENG) by integrating a planetary gear-based mechanical structure with a multilayer parallel TENG configuration. This design significantly reduces the threshold for mechanical energy input while achieving a high-voltage output. By optimizing the rectification circuit, the crest factor was effectively reduced, and the current output was substantially enhanced. The EC-TENG demonstrated a maximum open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 575 V and a short-circuit current (ISC) of 42 mu A, sufficient to power commercial electronic devices such as lamps. To enhance the portability and durability of the EC-TENG, a standardized manufacturing and packaging process was implemented, enabling quick replacement of vulnerable components and improving system reliability and service life. The EC-TENG shows great potential for high-voltage electrochemical applications, such as rust removal, and offers a sustainable and efficient solution for energy harvesting in distributed systems. This work provides a new perspective for addressing energy challenges and expanding the application scope of TENG-based technologies.

AB The wave energy harvesting efficiency (EHE) and electrical energy storage efficiency (ESE) significantly impact ocean power at the front-end and back-end stages, respectively. In this work, to maximize the overall energy conversion affected by these two factors, a clip-like structured pendulum coupled nanogenerator (CP-CNG) integrated with a dual-track circuit (DTC) is elaborately designed to address poor energy conversion of the TENGs for marine monitoring. The optimized EHE was realized through coupling one freestanding triboelectric nano -generator (FR-TENG) unit and two electromagnetic generator (EMG) units into two contact-separation tribo-electric nanogenerator (CS-TENG) units. The space utilization rate of CP-CNG can be as high as 91.9%. Meanwhile, increased ESE is achieved by integrating DTC as voltage regulators, which perform backend energy management for CS-TENG and EMG, respectively. It is worth noting that for a 1 mF capacitor, the stored energy via the cooperation of CP-CNG and DTC can reach 60.7 mJ in 110 s, which is about 164 times that of CS-TENG (0.37 mJ) coupling with FR-TENG and EMG and 1.6 times that of CS-TENG (36.8 mJ) with buck circuit, demonstrating excellent synergistic effects. Owing to the synergistic effect, one CP-CNG can continuously drive four thermohygrometers under simulated water wave conditions. In additional, a hazard alarm system, including an immersion sensor, Bluetooth and gateway support, can also be powered by one CP-CNG successfully. This work develops a state-of-the-art concept for maximum energy conversion of TENGs, which should have a pro-found impact on the design of high-performance TENGs in the future.

AB Addressing the challenges linked to the high Levelised Cost of Electricity in ocean wave energy, the utilization of arrays comprising oscillating water columns (OWCs) emerges as a promising and preferred strategy. In this study, the efficacy of a linear OWC arrayed structure, comprising three identical cylindrical units embedded into an inclined breakwater, was demonstrated by leveraging the Computational Fluid Dynamics technique. The investigation delved into the potential impacts of varying the transverse spacing between the sub-units within the array and adjusting the slope profile. Comparisons were drawn between the integrated system - comprising an arrayed system and an inclined breakwater - and its equivalent embedded into a vertical breakwater under different water depth conditions owing to the influence of the tidal range. The results indicate that superior power extraction emerges when employing a larger transverse spacing, through amplifying the capture width ratio across a broader spectrum of wave frequencies, with a substantial 55.8% increment between the larger and smaller transverse spacing conditions. A moderate slope profile emerges as the favored choice for enhancing performance provided that the transverse spacing is to a larger extent. The advantageous performance of the arrayed system in contrast to the isolated structure, leveraging the principle of the qfactor, becomes more evident, particularly under a moderate slope profile. Additionally, the incorporation of an arrayed system into an inclined breakwater exhibits heightened potential for harnessing wave energy, particularly when stimulated by long-period waves, attributed largely to amplified wave scattering. Conversely, integration into a vertical breakwater excels within the domain of short-period waves.

AB The rapid expansion in miniaturization, usability, energy efficiency, and affordability of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, integrated with innovations in smart capability, is greatly increasing opportunities in ground-level monitoring of ecosystems at a specific scale using sensor grids. Surrounding sound is a powerful data source for investigating urban and non-urban ecosystem health, and researchers commonly use robust but expensive passive sensors as monitoring equipment to capture it. This paper comprehensively describes the hardware behind our low-cost, small multipurpose prototype, capable of monitoring different environments (e.g., remote locations) with onboard processing power. The device consists of a printed circuit board, microprocessor, local memory, environmental sensor, microphones, optical sensors and LoRa (Long Range) communication systems. The device was successfully used in different use cases, from monitoring mosquitoes enhanced with optical sensors to ocean activities using a hydrophone.

AB Poleward energy transport in the atmosphere and oceans constitutes an important branch of the global energy budget, and its role in the climate system has been the subject of many studies. In the atmosphere, the transport is affected by "eddies" and large scale meridional cells, both with zero net mass transport across latitude circles, but also partly by processes associated with a net transport of mass across latitude circles. The latter must cease to operate in steady state, but they may be significant when time variability of the heat budget is considered. Indeed, examination of reanalysis data on short (daily to monthly) timescales shows that mass variations on these timescales result in surprisingly large fluctuations (in excess of W = 1 PW) in the poleward heat transport. These fluctuations are referred to as "extensive", for they primarily alter the mass integrated energy of the region considered, but not its averaged value. It is suggested that extensive fluctuations mask more meaningful climate signals present in the heat transport variability aEuroion monthly and interannual timescales, and a new formulation is proposed to isolate the latter. This new formulation is applied successfully to reanalysis data and climate model simulations.

AB Considering the abundant wind and solar energy resources on waters, this paper integrates wind assistant propulsion and photovoltaic technology with ship electric power system as sail-photovoltaic-hybrid power system (sail-PV-HPS). When properly designed, sail-PV-HPS can present environmental and economic benefits compared with conventional sail-diesel power system. However, the optimal design of sail-PV-HPS is a complex task due to environmental uncertainties. In order to fill such gap, this paper proposes a probabilistic optimization method to determine the size parameters of sail-PV-HPS, pursing minimum GHG emission and lifecycle cost. Two pairs of joint distributions of wind speed and wind direction as well as solar irradiance and ambient temperature are established based on coupla function considering the interconnection and seasonal characteristics of the meteorology variables. The performance of the proposed approach is assessed by the retrofit of the power system of an unmanned ocean surveillance trimaran sailing in the Yellow Sea area. A deterministic optimization and a quasiprobabilistic optimization are performed to highlight the effect and importance of taking the uncertainties and their correlation into consideration. Results show that the sail-PV-HPS designed by the proposed probabilistic method outperforms the sail-PV-HPS given by the deterministic optimization and a quasi-probabilistic optimization, as well as, the original power system of the trimaran in terms of GHG emission and lifecycle cost.

AB The NOAA-9 Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) scanner measured broadband shortwave, longwave, and total radiances from February 1985 through January 1987. These scanner radiances are reprocessed using the more recent Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) unfiltering algorithm. The scene information, including cloud properties, required for reprocessing is derived using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data on board NOAA-9, while no imager data were used in the original ERBE unfiltering. The reprocessing increases the NOAA-9 ERBE scanner unfiltered longwave radiances by 1.4%-2.0% during daytime and 0.2%-0.3% during nighttime relative to those derived from the ERBE unfiltering algorithm. Similarly, the scanner unfiltered shortwave radiances increase by similar to 1% for clear ocean and land and decrease for all-sky ocean, land, and snow/ice by similar to 1%. The resulting NOAA-9 ERBE scanner unfiltered radiances are then compared with NOAA-9 nonscanner irradiances by integrating the ERBE scanner radiance over the nonscanner field of view. The comparison indicates that the integrated scanner radiances are larger by 0.9% for shortwave and 0.7% smaller for longwave. A sensitivity study shows that the one-standard-deviation uncertainties in the agreement are +/- 2.5%, +/- 1.2%, and +/- 1.8% for the shortwave, nighttime longwave, and daytime longwave irradiances, respectively. The NOAA-9 and ERBS nonscanner irradiances are also compared using 2 years of data. The comparison indicates that the NOAA-9 nonscanner shortwave, nighttime longwave, and daytime longwave irradiances are 0.3% larger, 0.6% smaller, and 0.4% larger, respectively. The longer observational record provided by the ERBS nonscanner plays a critical role in tying the CERES-like NOAA-9 ERBE scanner dataset from the mid-1980s to the present-day CERES scanner data record.

AB The space-air-ground-sea integrated network (SAGSIN) integrates diverse heterogeneous networks, which makes the pervasive communication and computing service of maritime users possible. In SAGSIN, communication nodes are scarce and computing resources are tight. Tasks of users can be offloaded to the network edge, such as at surface ship, buoy and drone. However, some traditional task offloading decisions become inapplicable as users move or the topology of networks changes. Therefore, in order to ensure the continued effectiveness of the task offloading strategy in dynamic ocean scenarios, we need to design an efficient offloading method to improve the overall network performance. To address this issue, we propose a resource-aware deep reinforcement learning method to optimize task offloading decisions. In this scheme, the available resources of mobile users are perceived in real time, and efficient computation offloading and task migration decisions are made based on the results. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. In addition, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the system delay and energy consumption as the number of tasks increases, and reduce task migration.

AB The Earth system models have been actively developed during recent decades. They integrate the blocks describing the dynamics of the atmosphere, the ocean and the cryosphere. The Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) is one of the most important components of the Earth's cryosphere. Therefore, the incorporation of the AIS model into the Earth system model will significantly improve the accuracy of reconstructions of climate parameters for paleoclimate studies and for climate predictions. This paper presents a description of the energy balance block of the AIS model. This is a continuation of our recent work on integration of the cryosphere block to the climate model. The testing of the block (the EWBM-A buffer model) was carried out using the climate data generated by the INMCM model developed in the Institute of Numerical Mathematics of RAS. The results of the calculations of the surface mass balance components of the Antarctic ice sheet are presented for the 30-year pre-industrial period and are compared with the recent results obtained in the literature.

AB This 3-day hindcast case study focuses on the effects of the initial errors, a non-negligible factor in oceanic prediction, on VTS prediction in the NSCS and provides scientific guidance on observation design through tar-geted observation. Based on the Conditional Nonlinear Optimal Perturbation (CNOP) approach and the Regional Ocean Modeling System, the impact of optimal initial errors (OIEs) on the 3-day VTS prediction is estimated and their nonlinear evolution mechanism is clarified. The OIEs, horizontally distributed along the 1000 m isobath and vertically confined within the upper 50 m, experience non-localized evolution and cause a rapid increase in the root mean square errors by about 100 times during the prediction period. Eddy energetics analysis indicates that barotropic instabilities constitute a key factor in the evolution of the OIEs. In addition, sensitive areas are identified for targeted observation based on the vertically integrated total energy of the OIEs. Sensitive exper-iments demonstrate that the prediction errors caused by random initial errors in the sensitive areas are larger than those in other nearby areas. Observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) further suggest that elimi-nating the initial errors in sensitive areas can improve VTS prediction by over 50%. This study reveals the patterns and growth dynamic mechanism of CNOP-type OIEs in 3-day VTS prediction in the NSCS and provides scientific guidance for operational observation design.

AB A centralized airflow control scheme for a complex ocean energy network (OEN) is proposed in this paper to reduce the output power variation (OPV). The OEN is an integrated network of multiple oscillating water columns (OWCs) that are located at different geographical sites connected to a common electrical grid. The complexity of the OWC-OEN increases manifolds due to the integration of several OWCs and design of controllers become very challenging task. So, the centralized airflow control scheme is designed in two stages. In control stage-1, a proportional-integral- (PI-) type controller is designed to provide a common reference command to control stage-2. In control stage-2, the antiwindup PID controllers are implemented for the airflow control of all the OWCs simultaneously. In order to tune the large number of control parameters of this complex system, a fitness function based on integral squared error (ISE) is minimized using the widely adopted particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. Next, the simulation results were obtained with random wave profiles created using the Joint North Sea Wave Project (JONSWAP) irregular wave model. The OPV of the proposed OWC-OEN was reduced significantly as compared to the individual OWC. It was further observed that the OPV of the proposed scheme was lower than that achieved with uncontrolled and MPPT controlled OWC-OEN. The effect of communication delay on the OPV of the proposed OWC-OEN scheme was also investigated with the proposed controller, which was found to be robust for a delay up to 100 ms.

AB Presently, among the global ocean energy technologies, the most conventional one is the wave energy power generation device based on the oscillating water column (OWC) wave energy converter. Given the fluctuation and randomness of waves and the complexity of the current power grid, the dynamic response of grid connections must be considered. Furthermore, considering the characteristics of the wave energy converter, this paper proposed an adaptive intelligent controller (AIC) for the permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) in an OWC. The proposed controller includes a grey predictor, a recurrent wavelet-based Elman neural network (RWENN), and an adaptive critical network (ACN) to improve the stability of OWC power generation. This scheme can increase the maximum power output and improve dynamic performance when a transient occurs under the operating conditions of random wave changes. The proposed AIC for the PMSG based on OWC has a faster response speed, a smaller overshoot, and better stability than the traditional PI controller. This further verifies the availability of the proposed control strategy.

AB The extreme precipitation (EP) in the early and late rainy seasons in Southern China is investigated from the perspective of moist static energy (MSE). At the synoptic time scale, the EP is accompanied by the charge-discharge paradigm of the vertically integrated MSE ((MSE)); the positive (MSE) anomaly reaches the peak one day before EP and decreases quickly during the event. The charge-discharge paradigm of (MSE) is dominated by the horizontal and vertical advection, respectively. However, synoptic systems responsible for the (MSE) charge in the early and late rainy seasons are different due to the different horizontal distributions of climatological MSE in the lower troposphere caused by the northward migration of solar radiation and the monsoon system. At the interannual time scale, more EP in the early (late) rainy season is associated with the higher seasonal-mean (MSE) that can be caused by the anomalous anticyclone (cyclone) in the western North Pacific induced by the SST anomalies in the tropical Indian Ocean and central North Pacific (the trop-ical Pacific). The multimodel ensemble mean of CMIP6 models reproduces well the observed (MSE)-EP relationship in both the historical and Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5 (SSP5-8.5) runs. Moreover, the mean state of (MSE) increases in the SSP5-8.5 compared to historical runs along with more frequent occurrence of EP events. Hence, (MSE) can serve as a useful metric for studying EP in Southern China at various time scales.

AB Energy production from ocean waves remains in the research and development phase, due in part to the lack of maturity of the technology, as well as the economical unfeasibility of large-scale projects. Integration of wave energy converters into breakwaters is a strategy to improve the economic viability of the energy conversion system. The cost of electricity is reduced through the sharing of construction, installation, maintenance and operation activities. This work focuses on the design of an oscillating-water-column device to be integrated into a caisson used for breakwaters. A numerical model based on linear potential flow theory was developed. The viscous flow effects in the duct and the nonlinear turbine damping characteristic were linearized for the application of a frequency domain analysis. Furthermore, the device performance was estimated under irregular wave conditions using stochastic modelling for three wave climates and the influence of tidal variability is studied. The design and performance optimization of the submerged duct, air chamber and turbine are considered for the following oscillating-water-column duct configurations: conventional; U-shape; and L-shape. The results show all devices have better power conversion performance for the lower wave periods observed in the Mediterranean Sea than for the studied North Atlantic Ocean wave climates. The U-shaped converter outperforms the other configurations in all three locations, with a maximum theoretical annual pneumatic power of 46.8 kW/m when compared with 39.4 kW/m and 38.0 kW/m for the L-shape and conventional device, respectively. The tidal level variation does have some influence on the device performance, but the impact is minor.

AB The Tianjin port plays a relevant role in driving both ship navigation and the weather and climate of the area. To better understand the underlying peculiarities of this area, several in-service coastal ocean system and facilities have been constructed, at present, the whole coastal ocean systems at Tianjin port have been improved, however, they cannot meet the safety requirements of traffic management and navigational safety. Marine buoys have the unreplaceable advantages of long-term, real-time, reliable capabilities and trivial environmental restrictions to monitor the marine dynamics. Here an innovative multifunctional buoy prototype is proposed to continuously measure meteorological and oceanographic parameters at a high spatial and temporal resolution, which can ensure navigation safety at Tianjin Port. Solar panels and battery module are personalized to ensure electric supply to the buoy system. An independent ARM (Advanced RISC Machine)-based module is affiliated to maintain the stability of the data acquisition and communication module. Buoy platform based on Beidou difference is proved to be an effective approach for the tide measurement. Additionally, a web-designed software for data acquisition is integrated for the visualization purpose. Finally, in-field recording test at Tianjin port will be performed to verify effectiveness of our system on monitoring environment dynamics. It turns out that our buoy prototype functions as a reliable and energy favorable electrical device and shed light on the development of effective measurement instruments working under unpredictable and harsh marine environment.

DE climate change damage; modified VENSIM DICE model; small modular
   reactors; solar and wind power costs
AB During the last few years, nuclear energy has received great attention due to the increase in climate change awareness. According to the Paris agreement, global temperature is to be kept below 2 degrees C and preferably below 1.5 degrees C by 2050. This approach has been substantially confirmed in the recent COP 26 in Glasgow. This research investigates the effects of integrating SMR nuclear power plants (small modular reactors) into the Nordhaus Dynamic Integrated Climate Economy (DICE) model for reducing the CO2 emissions in the atmosphere by substituting all existing fossil-fueled power plants (FPPP). The software is based on the VENSIM dynamic systems modeling platform. Simulations were carried out from the year 2019 to 2100 using 10-year increments. Several scenarios were thus simulated replacing roughly 70,000 FPPPs operating at this time in the world. Simulations indicate a CO2 reduction of approximately 12.63% relative to the initial conditions used and using 87,830 SMR core units of 80 MWe electric each to meet such demand. The DICE model further predicts the cost of climate damage impacting the upper ocean and atmospheric temperatures, and the deep ocean temperature as USD 1.515 trillion (US Dollar; (US) trillion = 1,000,000,000,000 (1 x 10(12))) by the end of this century. From a modified section of the model, a cost of USD 1.073 trillion is predicted as the toll on human health costs. This is thus equal to a USD 2.59 trillion loss in the economy.

AB In this study, we compare the Energy Exascale Earth Systems Model (E3SM) multiscale modeling framework (MMF) with the cloud resolving model (CRM) configured in two (2dMMF) and three (3dMMF) dimensions. We explore how CRM dimensionality impacts the representation of mean and extreme precipitation characteristics. Our results show that tropical mean precipitation patterns are better represented in 3dMMF compared to observations (Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrivals for GPM and Global Precipitation Climatology Project One Degree Daily products), while 2dMMF better captures extreme precipitation intensity, with systematic land-ocean differences in precipitation and cloud-associated variables. These differences are attributed to the co-occurrence of CRM throttling (i.e., suppressed convection in due to smaller numbers of CRM columns and domain size) and dilution (i.e., 3-D cloud circulations with increased entrainment and lower precipitation efficiency) effects. Overall, throttling results in more low-level humidity in 2dMMF and dilution contributes to more high clouds with less precipitation efficiency in 3dMMF. Since throttling occurs more strongly over the ocean than land, the 3dMMF tends to have less cloud liquid and precipitation over the ocean and more cloud ice and precipitation over land. These results may serve as a guide for choosing the CRM structure to reduce precipitation and cloud-related biases.

DE Stochastic process; Dynamic copula bayesian network; External shock;
   Health index; System resilience
AB To increase the resistance of the marine mechatronics systems to various external shocks, it is essential to conduct resilience-based system early design for ensuring high reliability and safety. However, due to the harsh ocean working conditions and complex configurations of the marine mechatronics systems, it is challenging to develop a general, comprehensive, and reasonable resilience model for evaluating its ability to resist various external shocks and guide the early design of the system. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper first uses the stochastic process combined with the shock-energy model to describe the component competing degradation process from internal degradation and external random shocks. A dynamic copula Bayesian network (DCBN) is then proposed to describe the system characteristics (i.e., the dynamics, uncertainty, randomness, nonlinearity, and dependency). The system health index is also determined by the DCBN based on component health index information. Afterwards, the time-dependent system integrated resilience index (TDSIRI) and timeindependent system integrated resilience index (TISIRI), which incorporates the system resistibility, absorbability, and recovery indices, are introduced. The system configuration optimization design aims at maximizing the TISIRI while satisfying the reliability requirement and cost budget constraints. Finally, a semi-active heave compensation hydraulic system is considered as an example to verify the high efficiency of the proposed model and conduct a comparison analysis. The results obtained in this study contribute to the development of a system health index evaluation model and a general system resilience model. They also provide valuable insights for designers seeking for optimal system configuration at an early design stage.

AB Multi-generation system driven by alternative energies provides a promising solution for meeting the challenges of energy and fresh water with the rapid development of economy. In this paper, an innovative combined cooling, desalination and power (CCDP) cycle is proposed, which integrates multi-effect distillation (MED) and ejector refrigeration cycle with organic Rankine cycle. The surface warm seawater further heated by the solar energy and the deep cold seawater are taken as the heating and cooling sources, respectively. Mathematical model of the combined cycle is developed to evaluate the thermodynamic and economic performances. The effects of generation temperature, condensing temperature and evaporating temperature are investigated, and comparative analysis of five working fluids is conducted as well. The results indicate that the CCDP system with lower condensing temperature and generation temperature is conducive to obtaining higher exergy efficiency eta(ex), but leads to the increase of total cost rate (TCR). Furthermore, for the trade-off between thermodynamic and economic performances, a multi-objective optimization is conducted in terms of eta(ex) and TCR as objective functions. The Pareto optimal solutions (POS) for the five working fluids are determined based on a fast and elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and decision-making technique. According to the results of POS, R601 has the best performance with 6.51 x 10(4) $/y of TCR and 31.62% of exergy efficiency, followed by R245fa, R600a, R236ea and R152a. The percentage of initial investment and the distribution of exergy flow for the POS of R601 are obtained as well.

AB The existence of rogue or freak waves in the ocean has been known for some time. They have been reported in the context of optical lattices and the financial market. We ask whether such waves are generic to late time behavior in nonlinear systems. In that vein, we examine the dynamics of an alignment of spherical elastic beads held within fixed, rigid walls at zero precompression when they are subjected to sufficiently rich initial conditions. Here we define such waves generically as unusually large energy fluctuations that sustain for short periods of time. Our simulations suggest that such unusually large fluctuations ("hot spots") and occasional series of such fluctuations through space and time ("rogue fluctuations") are likely to exist in the late time dynamics of the granular chain system at zero dissipation. We show that while hot spots are common in late time evolution, rogue fluctuations are seen in purely nonlinear systems (i.e., no precompression) at late enough times. We next show that the number of such fluctuations grows exponentially with increasing nonlinearity whereas rogue fluctuations decrease superexponentially with increasing precompression. Dissipation-free granular alignment systems may be possible to realize as integrated circuits and hence our observations may potentially be testable in the laboratory.

AB We demonstrate the first climate-scale, numerical ocean simulations improved through distributed, online inference of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) using SmartSim. SmartSim is a library dedicated to enabling online analysis and Machine Learning (ML) for high performance, numerical simulations. In this paper, we detail the SmartSim architecture and provide benchmarks including online inference with a shared ML model, EKEResNet, on heterogeneous HPC systems. We demonstrate the capability of SmartSim by using it to run a 12-member ensemble of global-scale, high-resolution ocean simulations, each spanning 19 compute nodes, all communicating with the same ML architecture at each simulation timestep. In total, 970 billion inferences are collectively served by running the ensemble for a total of 120 simulated years. The inferences are used to predict the oceanic eddy kinetic energy (EKE), which is a variable that is used to tune different turbulence closures in the model and thus directly affects the simulation. The root-mean-square of the error in EKE (as compared to an eddy-resolving simulation) is 20% lower when using the ML-prediction than the previous state of the art. This demonstration is an example of how machine learning methods can be integrated into traditional numerical simulations, replace prognostic equations, and preserve overall simulation stability without significantly affecting the time to solution.

AB With the increasing threat to environment and the fast depleting fossil fuel resources, hybrid power systems consisting of two or more renewable energy sources such as solar PV, wind, biomass, ocean thermal-with or without the back up of diesel generator have come to the forefront. These hybrid systems are normally integrated with battery banks for total reliability; such systems have brought about better quality of life in remote areas of developing economics. The remote areas in the state of Tamil Nadu in India possess excellent renewable energy sources. These areas fall under different climatic zones, are sparsely populated and are in the process of development. Though these areas are connected to the grid, Tamil Nadu grid is not stable; it is currently experiencing 40% short fall in generation. Thus grid power is available to these remote areas only for 10 h a day and even when available, there are voltage frequency problems. This paper analyses the economic feasibility of installing and operating hybrid systems in these areas. The areas are divided into different climatic zones and the hybrid system economy is analyzed for each climatic zone on the basis of NPC (net present cost), consumption of diesel and renewable fraction for all climate zones. The analysis indicates that the interior climatic zone - the area would be the optimum climatic zone to install HPS PV/diesel. The sensitivity analysis proves that the NPC of such a system can be reduced. It is suggested that due to high initial cost, government subsidy is necessary to adopt the system on a large scale. Such a profit will encourage development of renewable energy utilization and bring about rapid development of these remote areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Arctic sea ice extent throughout the melt season is closely associated with initial sea ice state in winter and spring. Sea ice leads are important sites of energy fluxes in the Arctic Ocean, which may play an important role in the evolution of Arctic sea ice. In this study, we examine the potential of sea ice leads as a predictor for summer Arctic sea ice extent forecast using a recently developed daily sea ice lead product retrieved from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Our results show that July pan-Arctic sea ice extent can be predicted from the area of sea ice leads integrated from midwinter to late spring, with a prediction error of 0.28 million km(2) that is smaller than the standard deviation of the observed interannual variability. However, the predictive skills for August and September pan-Arctic sea ice extent are very low. When the area of sea ice leads integrated in the Atlantic and central and west Siberian sector of the Arctic is used, it has a significantly strong relationship (high predictability) with both July and August sea ice extent in the Atlantic and central and west Siberian sector of the Arctic. Thus, the realistic representation of sea ice leads (e.g., the areal coverage) in numerical prediction systems might improve the skill of forecast in the Arctic region.

TI Asymmetric restart in a stochastic climate model: A theoretical

   global warming

AB The continuous heating of the Earth's surface and aerosphere causes global warming. Recent developments predict that at the end of the twenty-first century, with 3 degrees C on average global warming will yield a regional augmentation in the probability of the abnormally large precipitation accumulation in a single downpour event. We examine this issue using a stochastic climate model and provide a theoretical scheme to the increased possibility of cloudburst in a single rainfall event. We find that implementing a permanent upper cut-off in column integrated water vapour or an asymmetric stochastic resetting can reduce the abnormally high accumulation probability of such rainstorms. We report that an optimum upper limit of column integrated water vapour in the atmosphere ascertain the decrease in the heavy precipitation-accumulation. The presence of such a perpetual upper ceiling in the moisture content is energy exorbitant and can significantly affect the mean downpour. A careful choice of the system parameters ensures the decrease in mean accumulation size within a ten per cent tolerance limit. We introduce an asymmetric stochastic resetting to the amount of column integrated water vapour at its upper threshold to recompense the energy cost. We perceive that an adaptive restart rate is efficient enough to reduce the probability of targeted precipitation accumulation to the desired extent.

AB Particle-attached microbes play large roles in the ocean carbon cycle and help to sequester atmospheric CO2 and to deliver nutrients and energy on sinking particles to the deep sea. Here, we report on the genomic traits of particle-attached versus free-living microbes throughout the ocean water column to better differentiate their specific metabolic and ecological roles in the sea.
   Bacteria and archaea are central to the production, consumption, and remineralization of dissolved and particulate organic matter and contribute critically to carbon delivery, nutrient availability, and energy transformations in the deep ocean. To explore environmentally relevant genomic traits of sinking-particle-associated versus free-living microbes, we compared habitat-specific metagenome-assembled genomes recovered throughout the water column in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. The genomic traits of sinking-particle-associated versus free-living prokaryotes were compositionally, functionally, and phylogenetically distinct. Substrate-specific transporters and extracellular peptidases and carbohydrate-active enzymes were more enriched and diverse in particle-associated microbes at all depths than in free-living counterparts. These data indicate specific roles for particle-attached microbes in particle substrate hydrolysis, uptake, and remineralization. Shallow-water particle-associated microbes had elevated genomic GC content and proteome nitrogen content and reduced proteome carbon content in comparison to abyssal particle-associated microbes. An inverse trend was observed for their sympatric free-living counterparts. These different properties of attached microbes are postulated to arise in part due to elevated organic and inorganic nitrogen availability inside sinking particles. Particle-attached microbes also were enriched in genes for environmental sensing via two-component regulatory systems, and cell-cell interactions via extracellular secretion systems, reflecting their surface-adapted lifestyles. Finally, particle-attached bacteria had greater predicted maximal growth efficiencies than free-living bacterioplankton at all depths. All of these particle-associated specific genomic and proteomic features appear to be driven by microhabitat-specific elevated nutrient and energy availability as well as surface-associated competitive and synergistic ecological interactions. Although some of these characteristics have been previously postulated or observed individually, we report them together here in aggregate via direct comparisons of cooccurring free-living and sinking-particle-attached microbial genomes from the open ocean. IMPORTANCE Particle-attached microbes play large roles in the ocean carbon cycle and help to sequester atmospheric CO2 and to deliver nutrients and energy on sinking particles to the deep sea. Here, we report on the genomic traits of particle-attached versus free-living microbes throughout the ocean water column to better differentiate their specific metabolic and ecological roles in the sea. In general, the genomic properties and contents of particle-attached microbes reflected the physical and chemical compositions of their environment as well as their microhabitat-specific adaptive traits. In comparison to cooccurring free-living microbes, particle-attached microbes had larger genomes, greater capacity for extracellular polymer degradation, greater environmental sensing and response capacity, greater potential for motility and attachment, and higher growth efficiencies. Our results present an integrated new perspective on sinking-particle-attached microbial adaptive traits that contribute to their critical ecological and biogeochemical roles and activities in the sea.

AB Global maps of maximum bottom particle concentration, benthic nepheloid layer thickness, and integrated particle mass in benthic nepheloid layers (BNL) based on 2412 global profiles collected using the Lamont Thorndike nephelometer from 1964 to 1984 are compared with maps of those same properties compiled from 6392 global profiles measured by transmissometers from 1979 to 2016. Outputs from both instruments were converted to particulate matter concentration (PM). The purposes of this paper are to compare global differences and similarities in the location and intensity of BNLs measured with these two independent instruments over slightly overlapping decadal time periods, to combine the data sets in order to expand the time scale of global in situ measurements of BNLs, and to gain insight about the factors creating/sustaining BNLs. The similarity between general locations of high and low particle concentration BNLs during the two time periods indicates that the driving forces of erosion and resuspension of bottom sediments are spatially persistent during recent decadal time spans, though in areas of strong BNLs, intensity is highly episodic. Topography and well-developed current systems play a role. These maps will help to understand deep ocean sediment dynamics, linkage with upper ocean dynamics, the potential for scavenging of adsorption-prone elements near the seafloor, and provide a comprehensive comparison of these data sets on a global scale.
   During both time periods, BNLs are weak or absent in most of the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic basins away from continental margins. High surface eddy kinetic energy is associated with the Kuroshio Current east of Japan. Both data sets show weak BNLs south of the Kuroshio, but no transmissometer data have been collected beneath the Kuroshio itself. Sparse nephelometer data show moderate BNLs just north of the Kuroshio Extension, but with much lower concentrations than beneath the Gulf Stream. Strong BNLs are found in areas where eddy kinetic energy in overlying waters, mean kinetic energy near bottom, and energy dissipation within the bottom boundary layer are high. Areas of strongest BNLs include the Western North Atlantic, Argentine Basin (South Atlantic), areas around South Africa tied to the Agulhas Current region, and somewhat random locations in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current of the Southern Ocean.

AB The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) constellation is designed to provide observations of surface wind speed in and near the inner core of tropical cyclones with high temporal resolution throughout the storm's life cycle. A method is developed for estimating tropical cyclone integrated kinetic energy (IKE) using CYGNSS observations. IKE is calculated for each geographically based quadrant out to an estimate of the 34-kt (1 kt 5 0.51ms(-1)) wind radius. The CYGNSS-IKE estimator is tested and its performance is characterized using simulated CYGNSS observations with realistic measurement errors. CYGNSS-IKE performance improves for stronger, more organized storms and with increasing number of observations over the extent of the 34-kt radius. Known sampling information can be used for quality control. While CYGNSS-IKE is calculated for individual geographic quadrants, using a total-IKE-a sum over all quadrants-improves performance. CYGNSS-IKE should be of interest to operational and research meteorologists, insurance companies, and others interested in the destructive potential of tropical cyclones developing in data-sparse regions, which will now be covered by CYGNSS. The CYGNSS-IKE product will be available for the 2017 Atlantic Ocean hurricane season.

AB Waste heat recovery technology of ships is meaningful for the enhancement of system efficiency and protection of environment. Compared with conventional diesel engines, the natural gas engines have the advantage of low emission, and its exhaust gas with quite high temperature is very suitable for utilization as the heat source of cascade waste heat system. This study integrates an over-expansion transcritical CO2 cycle with a double effect absorption refrigeration cycle to recover the heat energy from a natural gas engine. At the same time, a post processing unit is proposed to remove the nitrogen oxide of flue gas. The research results indicate that the higher engine load contributes to improving the equivalent output work and economy of the combined cycle while the post-processing unit can further reduce the payback time under the given conditions. In terms of the parameters analyses, the turbine outlet pressure of transcritical cycle has an optimal value of 2.25 MPa, which can make the output work to reach the maximum value of 305.0 kW, and the performance improvement of refrigeration cycle can be achieved by decreasing the temperature of high pressure generator or increasing the temperature of low pressure generator. After multi-objective optimization, the residual equivalent output work, payback period and amount of NOx reduction of the total system are 150.77 kW, 4.20 years and 8.16 g/kWh, respectively. In addition, the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index is further reduced to 8.21 gCO(2)/ton.nm with the aid of the proposed system.

AB Ocean acidification (OA) and pathogenic diseases pose a considerable threat to key species of marine ecosystem. However, few studies have investigated the combined impact of reduced seawater pH and pathogen challenge on the immune responses of marine invertebrates. In this study, Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas, were exposed to OA (-2000 ppm) for 28 days and then challenged with Vibrio splendidus for another 72 h. Hemocytc parameters showed that V. splendidus infection exacerbated the impaired oyster immune responses under OA exposure. An iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that C. gigas responded differently to OA stress and V. splendidus challenge, alone or in combination. Generally, OA appears to act via a generalized stress response by causing oxidative stress, which could lead to cellular i [limy and cause disruption to the cytoskeleton, protein turnover, immune responses and energy metabolism. V. splendidus challenge in oysters could suppress the immune system directly and lead to a disturbed cytoskeleton structure, increased protein turnover and energy metabolism suppression, without causing oxidative stress. The combined OA- and V. splendidus-treated oysters ultimately presented a similar, but stronger proteomic response pattern compared with OA treatment alone. Overall, the impaired oyster immune functions caused by OA exposure may have increased the risk of V. splendidus infection. These results have important implications for the impact of OA on disease outbreaks in marine invertebrates, which would have significant economic and ecological repercussions. kV, (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In ocean engineering, one of the most challenging phenomena to replicate is the interaction between waves and a moored floating body. Accurately evaluating such systems is essential for minimizing uncertainties, mitigating risks, and advancing technologies like wave energy converters. For this purpose, this study aims to develop a high-fidelity numerical model capable of reducing reliance on costly experimental campaigns during the device design phases. The model integrates a fluid dynamics module based on the Navier- Stokes equations, implemented in Star CCm+, with a mooring model utilizing a mass-spring-damper system, specifically MoorDyn. The primary objective is to introduce this coupled approach and demonstrate its efficacy through validation against experimental data from two distinct wave energy converters: ISWEC and PeWEC. The validation process encompasses comprehensive comparisons between simulated and observed kinematic behavior, mooring tensions, and crucially, pressure loads. Results indicate that the model is able to faithfully predict the complex phenomena involving a moored floating body, affirming the accuracy and reliability of the proposed coupling methodology. The coupling developed is available online link, where a simplified case study is present to show how to compile the library and add it in the numerical model.

AB Aim In the context of intensifying threats of climate change on marine communities, ecological models are widely applied for conservation strategies, though polar studies remain scarce given the limited number of datasets available. Correlative (e.g. species distribution models, SDM) and mechanistic (e.g. dynamic energy budget models, DEB) modelling approaches are usually used independently in studies. Using both approaches in integrative, hybrid models could help to better estimate the species potential ecological niche, as mechanistic and correlative models complement each other very well, giving more insights into species potential response to fast-changing environmental conditions. Location The study focusses on the Baie du Morbihan, a silled basin located in the east of the Kerguelen Islands (sub-Antarctic). Methods A hybrid, correlative-mechanistic model was implemented to predict the response of the endemic sea urchin Abatus cordatus (Verrill, 1876). We compared the performances of classic and integrated approaches to predict A. cordatus distribution according to two dates representing seasonal contrasts. Two integrated approaches were studied and performed by either (1) including the spatial projection of the DEB model as an input layer inside the SDM ('integrated SDM-DEB') or (2) using a Bayesian procedure to use DEB model outputs as priors of the SDM ('integrated Bayesian' approach). Results Results show higher performances of 'integrated Bayesian' approaches to evaluate A. cordatus potential ecological niche compared with 'classic' and 'integrated SDM-DEB' methods. The influence of environmental conditions on model predictions is further captured with these Bayesian procedures and better highlights the environmental influence on the species-predicted distribution. Model performance is good for the different simulations, and uncertainty in predictions is well-highlighted. Main conclusions The good performances of 'integrated Bayesian' approaches to estimate species potential ecological niche opens perspectives for future applications to a broad panel of natural examples, noteworthy for decision-making and conservation management purposes.

AB Clean energy captured by offshore wind turbines has been widely used for supporting onshore activities. In the near future, facilities such as offshore wind turbines can also play an important role in the energy transition of offshore activities. Offshore wind energy can be employed for electrifying operations in offshore fish farms, which are traditionally supplied by diesel-engine barges/generators. Based on this motivation, this study focuses on the design of a shared mooring system between a semi-submersible offshore fish cage and a spar-type floating wind turbine. A numerical model of the proposed shared mooring system is implemented in a global response analysis software sima for performing fully coupled time-domain simulations. The configuration of the shared mooring line is determined using an engineering approach, which comprises Irvine's formulation, system eigenvalue analysis, and cost estimation. Moreover, relevant case studies by altering the environmental conditions are performed. Extreme operational conditions that may give large relative motions are investigated thoroughly. The dynamic performance of the integrated system is compared with that of individual structures. The global motion of the floating wind turbine and its mooring line's tension behavior are obviously influenced by the existence of the shared line. In general, the present work investigates the feasibility of a shared mooring system for these types of offshore structures and further gives insights into the engineering design procedure.

AB Integrating microbial metabolism into geochemical modeling allows assessments of energy and mass transfer between the geosphere and the microbial biosphere. Energy and power supplies and demands can be assessed from analytical geochemical data given thermodynamic data for compounds involved in catabolism and anabolism. Results are reported here from a critique of the available standard state thermodynamic data for organic acids and acid anions involved in the citric acid cycle (also known as the tricarboxylic acid cycle or the Krebs cycle). The development of methods for estimating standard state data unavailable from experiments is described, together with methods to predict corresponding values at elevated temperatures and pressures using the revised Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers (HKF) equation of state for aqueous species. Internal consistency is maintained with standard state thermodynamic data for organic and inorganic aqueous species commonly used in geochemical modeling efforts. Standard state data and revised-HKF parameters are used to predict equilibrium dissociation constants for the organic acids in the citric acid cycle, and to assess standard Gibbs energies of reactions for each step in the cycle at elevated temperatures and pressures. The results presented here can be used with analytical data from natural and experimental systems to assess the energy and power demands of microorganisms throughout the habitable ranges of pressure and temperature, and to assess the consequences of abiotic organic compound alteration processes at conditions of subsurface aquifers, sedimentary basins, hydrothermal systems, meteorite parent bodies, and ocean worlds throughout the solar system.

AB The authors analyze the column-integrated moist static energy budget over the region of the tropical Indian Ocean covered by the sounding array during the Cooperative Indian Ocean Experiment on Intraseasonal Variability in the Year 2011 (CINDY2011)/Dynamics of the Madden Julian Oscillation (DYNAMO) field experiment in late 2011. The analysis is performed using data from the sounding array complemented by additional observational datasets for surface turbulent fluxes and atmospheric radiative heating. The entire analysis is repeated using the ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim). The roles of surface turbulent fluxes, radiative heating, and advection are quantified for the two MJO events that occurred in October and November using the sounding data; a third event in December is also studied in the ERA-Interim data.
   These results are consistent with the view that the MJO's moist static energy anomalies grow and are sustained to a significant extent by the radiative feedbacks associated with MJO water vapor and cloud anomalies and that propagation of the MJO is associated with advection of moist static energy. Both horizontal and vertical advection appear to play significant roles in the events studied here. Horizontal advection strongly moistens the atmosphere during the buildup to the active phase of the October event when the low-level winds switch from westerly to easterly. Horizontal advection strongly dries the atmosphere in the wake of the active phases of the November and December events as the westerlies associated with off-equatorial cyclonic gyres bring subtropical dry air into the convective region from the west and north. Vertical advection provides relative moistening ahead of the active phase and drying behind it, associated with an increase of the normalized gross moist stability.

   STABILITY; ALBEDO; INSTABILITY; DROUGHT
AB We formulate and analyze a simple dynamical systems model for climate-vegetation interaction. The planet we consider consists of a large ocean and a land surface on which vegetation can grow. The temperature affects vegetation growth on land and the amount of sea ice on the ocean. Conversely, vegetation and sea ice change the albedo of the planet, which in turn changes its energy balance and hence the temperature evolution. Our highly idealized, conceptual model is governed by two nonlinear, coupled ordinary differential equations, one for global temperature, the other for vegetation cover. The model exhibits either bistability between a vegetated and a desert state or oscillatory behavior. The oscillations arise through a Hopf bifurcation off the vegetated state, when the death rate of vegetation is low enough. These oscillations are anharmonic and exhibit a sawtooth shape that is characteristic of relaxation oscillations, as well as suggestive of the sharp deglaciations of the Quaternary.
   Our model's behavior can be compared, on the one hand, with the bistability of even simpler, Daisyworld-style climate-vegetation models. On the other hand, it can be integrated into the hierarchy of models trying to simulate and explain oscillatory behavior in the climate system. Rigorous mathematical results are obtained that link the nature of the feedbacks with the nature and the stability of the solutions. The relevance of model results to climate variability on various timescales is discussed.

AB A method is presented for calculating a complete, numerically closed, mechanical energy budget in a realistic simulation of circulation in a coastal-estuarine domain. The budget is formulated in terms of the "local'' available potential energy (APE; Holliday and McIntyre 1981). The APE may be split up into two parts based on whether a water parcel has been displaced up or down relative to its rest depth. This decomposition clearly shows the different APE signatures of coastal upwelling (particles displaced up by wind) and the estuary (particles displaced down by mixing). Because the definition of APE is local in almost the same sense that kinetic energy is, this study may form meaningful integrals of reservoir and budget terms even over regions that have open boundaries. However, the choice of volume to use for calculation of the rest state is not unique and may influence the results. Complete volume-integrated energy budgets over shelf and estuary volumes in a realistic model of the northeast Pacific and Salish Sea give a new way to quantify the state of these systems and the physical forces that influence that state. On the continental shelf, upwelling may be quantified using APE, which is found to have order-one seasonal variation with an increase due to winds and decrease due to mixing. In the Salish Sea estuarine system, the APE has much less seasonal variation, and the magnitude of the most important forcing terms would take over 7 months to fully drain this energy.

AB To facilitate the transition of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) from early stages to large-scale realworld applications, urgent mass production is imperative, necessitating standardized manufacturing processes. In this study, a novel "pause-and-insert" and "print-in-place" 3D printing approach has been devised, employing widely available fused deposition modeling (FDM) printers along with conductive (as electrodes) and nonconductive (for casing and support) filaments to make encapsulate microbeads triboelectric nanogenerator (MB-TENG). This innovation results in a fully enclosed freestanding-mode TENG pack, seamlessly integrated with a lightweight wind-induced oscillator featuring tuning systems, thus enabling efficient, safe, and noiseless omnidirectional wind energy harvesting. Through adept design and manufacturing techniques, systematic inner-structure optimization has been achieved, yielding superior output and industrialization levels compared to similar efforts. MB-TENG's surface charge density is as high as 19.9 mC/m2. The average power density is 13.8 W/m3. Moreover, the elimination of postprocessing significantly streamlines standard manufacturing, enhancing the prospects for device commercialization. Beyond its wind energy application, the versatile energy packs can serve as both ocean wave and human motion harvesters within network configurations, capable of powering a massive real-time monitoring sensor array.

AB Sea-ice-free Arctic summers are expected within the next decades due to anthropogenic warming. Studying past warm interglacials offers valuable insights into the Arctic climate system under similar conditions. Here we present a series of simulations that represent a chronological sequence of interglacial climate states over Marine Isotope Stages 5e and 11c using the Community Earth System Model. While previous studies attempted to explain the Arctic sea-ice evolution through changes in summer solstice insolation, we demonstrate that summer sea-ice area during both interglacial periods is primarily driven by an inverse relationship with integrated summer energy. Although proxy data yield conflicting results on Last Interglacial Arctic sea-ice cover, our simulations suggest seasonally ice-free conditions across the Arctic during the early interglacial phase. In both interglacials, climate states with intermediate levels of summer sea-ice area are characterized by maximum interannual variability in sea-ice area.

   INTERDECADAL VARIABILITY; SAHEL RAINFALL; GLOBAL ENERGY; WATER-VAPOR;
   CLIMATE; ENSO; PATTERNS
AB Vertically integrated atmospheric moisture transport from ocean to land [vertically integrated atmospheric moisture flux convergence (VMFC)] is a dynamic component of the global climate system but remains problematic in atmospheric reanalyses, with current estimates having significant multidecadal global trends differing even in sign. Continual evolution of the global observing system, particularly stepwise improvements in satellite observations, has introduced discrete changes in the ability of data assimilation to correct systematic model biases, manifesting as nonphysical variability. Land surface models (LSMs) forced with observed precipitation P and near-surface meteorology and radiation provide estimates of evapotranspiration (ET). Since variability of atmospheric moisture storage is small on interannual and longer time scales, VMFC 5 P - ET is a good approximation and LSMs can provide an alternative estimate. However, heterogeneous density of rain gauge coverage, especially the sparse coverage over tropical continents, remains a serious concern.
   Rotated principal component analysis (RPCA) with prefiltering of VMFC to isolate the artificial variability is used to investigate artifacts in five reanalysis systems. This procedure, although ad hoc, enables useful VMFC corrections over global land. The P - ET estimates from seven different LSMs are evaluated and subsequently used to confirm the efficacy of the RPCA-based adjustments. Global VMFC trends over the period 1979-2012 ranging from 0.07 to 20.03 mm day(-1) decade(-1) are reduced by the adjustments to 0.016 mm da(-1) decade(-1), much closer to the LSM P - ET estimate (0.007 mm day(-1) decade(-1)). Neither is significant at the 90% level. ENSO-related modulation of VMFC and P - ET remains the largest global interannual signal, with mean LSM and adjusted reanalysis time series correlating at 0.86.

AB Policies designed to address current challenges to the sustainability of fisheries generally use an ecosystem-based approach - one that incorporates interactions between fishes, fishers, and the environment. Fishing alters the trophic structure among coral reef fish but properly assessing those impacts requires an understanding of how and why that structure varies naturally across scales. Using a combination of small- and large-scale surveys, we generated biomass pyramids for 20 uninhabited Pacific islands, and found that (1) the distribution of reef fish biomass across trophic levels is highly scale dependent: trophic structures that appear top-heavy at small scales can take a variety of different states when data are integrated across the broader seascape; (2) reefs can have the greatest biomass at intermediate consumer levels, which we describe as "middle-driven" systems; and (3) in unfished coral reef systems, trophic structure is strongly predicted by energy into the base and middle of the food web, as well as by the interacting effect of water temperature.

AB Future changes in the climate system could have significant impacts on the natural environment and human activities, which in turn affect changes in the climate system. In the interaction between natural and human systems under climate change conditions, land use is one of the elements that play an essential role. On the one hand, future climate change will affect the availability of water and food, which may impact land-use change. On the other hand, human-induced land-use change can affect the climate system through biogeophysical and biogeochemical effects. To investigate these interrelationships, we developed MIROC-INTEG-LAND (MIROC INTEGrated LAND surface model version 1), an integrated model that combines the land surface component of global climate model MIROC (Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate) with water resources, crop production, land ecosystem, and land-use models. The most significant feature of MIROC-INTEG-LAND is that the land surface model that describes the processes of the energy and water balance, human water management, and crop growth incorporates a land use decision-making model based on economic activities. In MIROC-INTEG-LAND, spatially detailed information regarding water resources and crop yields is reflected in the prediction of future land-use change, which cannot be considered in the conventional integrated assessment models. In this paper, we introduce the details and interconnections of the submodels of MIROC-INTEG-LAND, compare historical simulations with observations, and identify various interactions between the submodels. By evaluating the historical simulation, we have confirmed that the model reproduces the observed states well. The future simulations indicate that changes in climate have significant impacts on crop yields, land use, and irrigation water demand. The newly developed MIROC-INTEG-LAND could be combined with atmospheric and ocean models to develop an integrated earth system model to simulate the interactions among coupled natural-human earth system components.

AB Virtual reality technology is a technology that generates a high-fidelity simulation environment by computer and enables users to immerse in the environment through a variety of sensor interfaces, thus realizing direct interaction between users and the virtual environment. Virtual environment is the application representation space of virtual reality technology, which is a visual platform integrating various technologies. For specific applications, building a three-dimensional, high-fidelity, and interactive virtual environment system is an important topic in the application of virtual reality technology. In this paper, simple illumination model and global illumination model are discussed, and the algorithm for parametric surface is discussed. In addition, the application of OpenGL in illumination model and texture mapping is also introduced. Taking the construction of virtual marine environment as an example, this paper develops a virtual marine environment system based on it. This paper introduces the simulation and simulation of ocean waves based on OpenGL wave spectrum by the method of equal energy.

AB This research explores the optimal operation of an offshore wave-powered hydrogen system, specifically designed to supply electricity and water to a bay in Humboldt, California, USA, and also sell it with hydrogen. The system incorporates a desalination unit to provide the island with fresh water and feed the electrolyzer to produce hydrogen. The optimization process utilizes a mixture of experts in conjunction with the Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) algorithm traditionally used in drug design, to achieve two main objectives: minimizing operational costs and maximizing revenue from the sale of water, hydrogen, and electricity. Many case studies are examined, representing typical electricity demand and wave conditions during typical summer, winter, spring, and fall days. The simulation, optimization, and results are carried out using MATLAB 2018 and SAM 2024 software applications. The findings demonstrate that the combination of the QSAR algorithm and quantum-inspired MoE results in higher revenue and lower costs compared to other current techniques, with hydrogen sales being the primary contributor to increased income.

AB Harvesting wind energy from the environment and integrating it with the internet of things and artificial intelligence to enable intelligent ocean environment monitoring are effective approach. There are some challenges that limit the performance of wind energy harvesters, such as the larger start-up torque and the narrow operational wind speed range. To address these issues, this paper proposes a wind energy harvesting system with a self-regulation strategy based on piezoelectric and electromagnetic effects to achieve state monitoring for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). The proposed energy harvesting system comprises eight rotation units with centrifugal adaptation and four piezoelectric units with a magnetic coupling mechanism, which can further reduce the start-up torque and expand the wind speed range. The dynamic model of the energy harvester with the centrifugal effect is explored, and the corresponding structural parameters are analyzed. The simulation and experimental results show that it can obtain a maximum average power of 23.25 mW at a wind speed of 8 m/s. Furthermore, three different magnet configurations are investigated, and the optimal configuration can effectively decrease the resistance torque by 91.25% compared with the traditional mode. A prototype is manufactured, and the test result shows that it can charge a 2200 mu F supercapacitor to 6.2 V within 120 s, which indicates that it has a great potential to achieve the self-powered low-power sensors. Finally, a deep learning algorithm is applied to detect the stability of the operation, and the average accuracy reached 95.33%, which validates the feasibility of the state monitoring of USVs.

AB In limited-area ocean models, open boundary conditions (OBCs) often create dynamic inconsistencies and perform poorly in resolving tidal or subtidal flow when both forces exist. Orlanski-type radiation OBCs are reasonably efficient at treating the subtidally forced flow, and Flather-type OBCs are commonly adapted for the tidally forced flow. However, neither of them performs well when tidal and subtidal forces simultaneously drive the flows. We have developed a novel OBC that integrates the active OBC in Gan and Allen (2005) and a Flather-type OBC. This new OBC accommodates the concurrent Tidal and Subtidal (TST) forcing, and the respective tidal or subtidal forcing, at the open boundary of a limited-area model. This new TST-OBC treats the tidal component with a Flather-type OBC, and it separates subtidal barotropic and baroclinic components into local (forced) and global (unforced) components. Then an unforced Orlanski-type OBC can be applied to the global part. We applied the TST-OBC to all model variables to reduce dynamic inconsistence. Using the Regional Ocean Modeling System, we applied the TST-OBC to the shallow East China Sea shelf where strong tidal and subtidal forces over complex topography govern the circulation. Our numerical experiments and analyses suggest that the TST-OBC was robust for both concurrent tidal-subtidal forcing and solely tidal or subtidal forcing at the open boundary. It reduced spurious energy reflection, and, overall, it performed better than an Orlanski-type or Flather-type OBC in reproducing realistic tidal and subtidal shelf circulation.

AB The present study investigates the spatial distribution of the M-2 internal tide in the Strait of Sicily using a three-dimensional sigma coordinate model, the Regional Ocean Modeling System. Realistic topography and stratification from existing observational data were used. The numerical simulations show that there are three distinct sites of strong M-2 internal tide generation, namely the western sill of the Adventure Bank, northwest of Sicily and north of Pantelleria isle. The conversion rate of energy from the M-2 surface to internal tide integrated over the whole model domain amounts to 47.5 MW, 75% of which are found to be generated over the three prominent topographic features mentioned above. The depth-integrated baroclinic energy flux depicts the propagation away from these sites, particularly toward the north and southwest. The maximum flux amplitudes are found in the three main generation sites identified, with the largest value occurring at the narrowest passage through the western sill. A comparison between the model and currentmeter measurements at two stations shows reasonable agreement for different depths. The similarities in the spatial distribution of the baroclinic energy flux divergence and the barotropic forcing suggest that the generation of the M-2 internal tide in the Strait of Sicily results primarily from barotropic tidal flow over sloping topography.

AB Submarine canyons are a common geomorphological feature along continental slopes worldwide and often found to be `hotspots' of internal tide activity. However, the majority of well-studied submarine canyons are simple linear incisions or have meandering morphology; internal tide energetics in branching (dendritic) canyons has not previously been investigated. Here we present a high-resolution (500-m) numerical modelling study of the internal tide within Whittard Canyon, a large, dendritic submarine canyon system that incises the Celtic Sea continental slope. A modified version of the Princeton Ocean Model is used to simulate the M-2 (semidiurnal) internal tide in the Whittard Canyon region, verified against a hydrographic dataset collected by an autonomous ocean glider. Much of the internal tide energy entering Whittard Canyon originates to the southeast, along the Celtic Sea shelf break. Internal tide generation also occurs within the canyon itself, but is in part compensated by areas of negative energy conversion. Depth-integrated internal tide energy fluxes exceed 8 kW m(-1) in the eastern limb of the canyon. The internal tide is topographically steered through the major limbs and along canyon energy flux is bottom intensified, suggesting topographic focusing. The down canyon extent of bottom intensification closely corresponds to the point that along-canyon slope becomes near-critical to the semidiurnal internal tide. Energetically, the multiple limbs of Whittard Canyon behave differently, some are net sources of internal tide energy whilst others are net sinks. Internal tide energy dissipation also varies between the canyon limbs; bulk dissipation rates are 2. 1-7. 7 x 10(-8)W kg(-1). In addition, the effect of bathymetric resolution on internal tide generation and propagation is investigated by progressively smoothing the model domain. Decreasing the bathymetric resolution reduces internal tide generation and energy dissipation in both Whittard Canyon and the model domain as a whole, however, internal tide energy flux into the canyon is not consistently changed. At least 1.5-km resolution bathymetry is required to adequately resolve the semidiurnal internal tide field in this region of complex topography.

In the geographical fields, waves are primary source of environmental process owed to energy conveyance on floating structure. This study aims to investigate the system of cold bosonic atoms in zigzag optics lattices. The solitonic patterns of the considered model successfully surveyed by using two integrated analytical techniques new extended direct algebraic and G'/G(2) expansion method. The exact solutions are presented by rational, trigonometric, hyperbolic and exponential functions. On the basis of solitons, we need to show that which one is more integrated and robust scheme. These solutions will help to understood the dynamics of cold bosonic atoms in zig-zag optical lattices and the several other systems. Three dimensional as well as two dimensional comparison presented for a cold bosonic atoms model solutions which are revealed diagrammatically for appropriate parameters by using Mathematica. This study will help physicists to predict some new hypothesis and theories in the field of mathematical physics.

AB This study reviews the system governed by the thickness-weighted average (TWA) equation of motion, considering energetics. It is known that the TWA equation of motion based on the primitive equation describes the fluid motion with the residual mean velocity defined as the TWA velocity and is written in the same form as the nondissipative primitive equation, except that the eddy momentum fluxes (the interfacial form stress and Reynolds flux associated with eddy motion) are embedded in this equation. Also, incompressibility and density (buoyancy) conservation in the adiabatic condition hold in this system. In this study, considering that the TWA system satisfies a time mean energy conservation of the primitive equation system, we obtain an energy equation showing that the rate of change of eddy energies (the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of the eddies) along pathlines with the residual mean velocity is caused by the work done by the eddy momentum fluxes. This relation is analogous to the relation between internal energy and the dissipation function in a viscous fluid. This study also reconsiders the TWA system in terms of Hamiltonian dynamics. Regarding the eddy energies and the eddy momentum fluxes as analogous to the internal energy and the viscous momentum fluxes, respectively, the methodology of the variational principle for a viscous fluid can be applied to the TWA system. The Lagrangian density in this system is defined as the mean kinetic energy minus the mean potential energy and the eddy energies. Minimizing this Lagrangian density integrated over space and time under the constraints of the incompressibility equation, the buoyancy equation, and the equation of the eddy energies yields the TWA equation of motion. If we neglect the eddy energies in the Lagrangian density and the constraint of the equation of the eddy energies, the resulting equation in the variational calculus is merely the nondissipative primitive equation. This suggests that considering these is essential for describing the motion in the TWA system. Moreover, we inferred from the equation of the eddy energy that the TWA equation of motion can be expressed in a different form in which the isotropic component of the eddy momentum fluxes is included as a part of the pressure. Applying this modified equation to the issue of downstream decaying mechanism of the western boundary current extension jets, it can be interpreted that the deceleration of the jet is caused by the pressure induced by the eddies.

AB The Red Sea, home to the second-longest coral reef system in the world, is a vital resource for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Red Sea provides 90% of the Kingdom's potable water by desalinization, supporting tourism, shipping, aquaculture, and fishing industries, which together contribute about 10%-20% of the country's GDP. All these activities, and those elsewhere in the Red Sea region, critically depend on oceanic and atmospheric conditions. At a time of mega-development projects along the Red Sea coast, and global warming, authorities are working on optimizing the harnessing of environmental resources, including renewable energy and rainwater harvesting. All these require high-resolution weather and climate information. Toward this end, we have undertaken a multipronged research and development activity in which we are developing an integrated data-driven regional coupled modeling system. The telescopically nested components include 5-km- to 600-m-resolution atmospheric models to address weather and climate challenges, 4-km- to 50-m-resolution ocean models with regional and coastal configurations to simulate and predict the general and mesoscale circulation, 4-km- to 100-m-resolution ecosystem models to simulate the biogeochemistry, and 1-km- to 50-m-resolution wave models. In addition, a complementary probabilistic transport modeling system predicts dispersion of contaminant plumes, oil spill, and marine ecosystem connectivity. Advanced ensemble data assimilation capabilities have also been implemented for accurate forecasting. Resulting achievements include significant advancement in our understanding of the regional circulation and its connection to the global climate, development, and validation of long-term Red Sea regional atmospheric-oceanic-wave reanalyses and forecasting capacities. These products are being extensively used by academia, government, and industry in various weather and marine studies and operations, environmental policies, renewable energy applications, impact assessment, flood forecasting, and more.

AB Hydrogen possesses the ability to produce energy with minimal greenhouse gas emissions when sustainably produced, making it a promising renewable energy carrier. Moreover, recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) can further enhance cleaner hydrogen production in a more optimised way. The main objective of this review paper is to comprehensively examine the current state-of-the-art in the integration of AI techniques with Renewable Energy Sources (RES), such as biomass, solar, algae power, geothermal, and wind to advance various hydrogen production methods, including electrolysis, biological, and photovoltaic processes. Furthermore, we aim to explore how AI optimisation can enhance sustainability, reliability, and commercial viability of Green Hydrogen (GH2) systems. These processes are crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and meet the world's growing energy needs. The integration of RES with hydrogen production technologies has been recognised as a key strategy to attain a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy future, and the incorporation of AI can optimise efficiency and cost-effectiveness. This review found that there is a growing interest in the development of AI techniques to optimise GH2 production. While most of the studies focus on utilising wind and solar energy sources, this review found minimal existing research applying AI to GH2 production from algae, ocean, intermittency, and hybrid RES. Moreover, no works exploring AI to optimise GH2 production from sources like tidal and hydropower were found. Thus, prioritising AI-enabled system development to integrate and optimise these resources for GH2 production can help progress renewable generation capabilities towards a more sustainable, cleaner, carbon-free future for industry, transport, and societal sectors. Further extensive research is essential to fully harness the promise of AI in transforming diverse RES for clean hydrogen.

AB The worldwide large-scale commercial deployment of 5G has commenced in 2020 for supporting enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB), ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (uRLLC), and massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC) services. Nevertheless, the upsurge of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered applications, the developmental law of one-decade-one-generation of wireless communications and the inherent limitations of 5G have also been spurring the industry and academia to dedicate their efforts to the research of future 6G wireless systems. 6G will be a disruptive, pervasive, intelligent, and endogenous wireless system, which will revolutionize all walks of life and accelerate the transformation and innovation of the global society. In this paper, we present a forward-looking, comprehensive and in-depth analysis and technical identification of 6G. Specifically, we firstly introduce the fundamental theories of 6G in terms of potential requirements. Then, we focus our attention on the discussion of promising key technologies in terms of spectrum, air interface, delay, access, energy consumption, coverage, AI, electromagnetism, interaction, etc.

AB The mesoscale eddies are prevalent oceanic circulation phenomena, exerting significant influence on various aspects of the marine environment including energy transfer, material transport and ecosystem dynamics in the Northwest Pacific Ocean. However, due to sparse vertical observational data, the understanding of the three-dimensional temperature structure of individual cases of mesoscale eddies remains limited. In recent years, utilizing surface remote sensing observations to estimate subsurface temperature anomaly has been crucial for comprehending the intricate multi-dimensional dynamic processes in the ocean. Consequently, this paper proposes an eddy residual multi-channel attention convolution network (ERCACN) with the adaptive threshold and designs the combination of various surface features to estimate the eddy subsurface temperature anomaly (ESTA). By integrating results with climatic temperature, thermal structures containing 46 levels at depths up to 1000 m could be obtained, achieving excellent daily temporal resolution and 0.25 degrees spatial resolution. Validation using independent Argo profiles from 2016 to 2017 reveals that the combination of multiple surface variables outperforms univariate methods, and the ERCACN model demonstrates superior performance compared to other approaches. Overall, with an 8% error deemed acceptable, the ERCACN model achieves a precision of 88.08% in estimating ESTA. This method provides a novel perspective for other essential oceanic variables, contributing to a better perception of the global climate system.

AB This paper presents global comparisons of fundamental global climate variables from a suite of four pairs of matched low- and high-resolution ocean and sea ice simulations that are obtained following the OMIP-2 protocol (Griffies et al., 2016) and integrated for one cycle (1958-2018) of the JRA55-do atmospheric state and runoff dataset (Tsujino et al., 2018). Our goal is to assess the robustness of climate-relevant improvements in ocean simulations (mean and variability) associated with moving from coarse (similar to 1 degrees) to eddy-resolving (similar to 0.1 degrees) horizontal resolutions. The models are diverse in their numerics and parameterizations, but each low-resolution and high-resolution pair of models is matched so as to isolate, to the extent possible, the effects of horizontal resolution. A variety of observational datasets are used to assess the fidelity of simulated temperature and salinity, sea surface height, kinetic energy, heat and volume transports, and sea ice distribution. This paper provides a crucial benchmark for future studies comparing and improving different schemes in any of the models used in this study or similar ones. The biases in the low-resolution simulations are familiar, and their gross features - position, strength, and variability of western boundary currents, equatorial currents, and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current - are significantly improved in the high-resolution models. However, despite the fact that the high-resolution models "resolve" most of these features, the improvements in temperature and salinity are inconsistent among the different model families, and some regions show increased bias over their low-resolution counterparts. Greatly enhanced horizontal resolution does not deliver unambiguous bias improvement in all regions for all models.

AB With the rapid development of communication, the future Internet of Things will greatly expand its coverage to form the space-air-ground-ocean-integrated network (SAGOI-Net) and provide globally ubiquitous applications and services. In SAGOI-Net, the existing research work focused on system design and neglected the theoretical analysis of system performance. Furthermore, the Nakagami- $m$ fading model can fit the experimental data better than the Rayleigh and Rice fading models. Also, the Nakagami- $m$ fading model can adapt to the SAGOI-Net environment by changing the value of the shaping parameter $m$ . However, there is no work to analyze the performance of SAGOI-Net using Nakatomi- $m$ fading. Therefore, in this article, the synchronous downlink system is theoretically analyzed using the Nakagami- $m$ fading model. However, Then, the statistical characteristics of multiple access interference (MAI) and MAI-plus noise are theoretically derived. Furthermore, the accurate expression of the bit-error rate (BER) for the fading model is also derived. After that, we establish the relationship between the number of users, BER, and the information transmission rate to optimize energy efficiency. Finally, simulation results verify that the theoretical derivation results are reliable and effective.

AB Seasonal forecast skill of the basinwide and regional tropical cyclone (TC) activity in an experimental coupled prediction system based on the ECMWF System 4 is assessed. As part of a collaboration between the Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies (COLA) and the ECMWF called Project Minerva, the system is integrated at the atmospheric horizontal spectral resolutions of T319, T639, and T1279. Seven-month hindcasts starting from 1 May for the years 1980-2011 are produced at all three resolutions with at least 15 ensemble members. The Minerva system demonstrates statistically significant skill for retrospective forecasts of TC frequency and accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) in the North Atlantic (NA), eastern North Pacific (EP), and western North Pacific. While the highest scores overall are achieved in the North Pacific, the skill in the NA appears to be limited by an overly strong influence of the tropical Pacific variability. Higher model resolution improves skill scores for the ACE and, to a lesser extent, the TC frequency, even though the influence of large-scale climate variations on these TC activity measures is largely independent of resolution changes. The biggest gain occurs in transition from T319 to T639. Significant skill in regional TC forecasts is achieved over broad areas of the Northern Hemisphere. The highest-resolution hindcasts exhibit additional locations with skill in the NA and EP, including land-adjacent areas. The feasibility of regional intensity forecasts is assessed. In the presence of the coupled model biases, the benefits of high resolution for seasonal TC forecasting may be underestimated.

AB As the Earth warms, carbon sinks on land and in the ocean will weaken, thereby increasing the rate of warming. Although natural mechanisms contributing to this positive climate-carbon feedback have been evaluated using Earth system models, analogous feedbacks involving human activities have not been systematically quantified. Here we conceptualize and estimate the magnitude of several economic mechanisms that generate a carbon-climate feedback, using the Kaya identity to separate a net economic feedback into components associated with population, GDP, heating and cooling, and the carbon intensity of energy production and transportation. We find that climate-driven decreases in economic activity (GDP) may in turn decrease human energy use and thus fossil fuel CO2 emissions. In a high radiative forcing scenario, such decreases in economic activity reduce fossil fuel emissions by 13% this century, lowering atmospheric CO2 by over 100 ppm in 2100. The natural carbon-climate feedback, in contrast, increases atmospheric CO2 over this period by a similar amount, and thus, the net effect including both feedbacks is nearly zero. Our work highlights the importance of improving the representation of climate-economic feedbacks in scenarios of future change. Although the effects of climate warming on the economy may offset weakening land and ocean carbon sinks, a loss of economic productivity will have high societal costs, potentially increasing wealth inequity and limiting resources available for effective adaptation.

AB To obtain an optimum connection parameter combination for modular floating structures of multiple functions, an integrated methodology for the assessment and optimization is proposed in the present work, out of consideration for the balance between the functional performance and economic effect. To illustrate the whole process, two types of modular floating structures, i.e., a modular wave energy converter (WEC) and a modular mobile offshore base (MOB), are taken as the cases. For the two cases, connection configurations are first specified based on structural functions as well as environment conditions; then, quantified measurements are established and studied, based on which the following process of selection of optimization algorithms is done and the optimum solutions are obtained, making up a whole process of specification of the connection parameter combination for modular floating structures. The proposed methodology possesses the potential of offering guidance for the phase of preliminary design of connection structures of modular floating structures.

AB In this work we use satellite altimeter observations to study the mechanism of decadal variability of the Kuroshio Extension (KE), with special attention on jet-eddy energy transfer, and on the relationship between the wind-driven sea surface height anomalies (SSHAs) and those directly driven by intrinsic oceanic processes including jet and eddies. It is shown that energy feedback between the jet and mesoscale eddies can maintain the decadal oscillation of the KE. The wind-driven SSHAs are broad-scale and very weak compared to the intrinsic variability. Physically they can potentially trigger delayed responses of the latter by modulating vorticity advection from upstream but the statistical significance is low. KE perturbations resulting from the intrinsic variability, on the other hand, could feedback onto the wind-driven SSHAs by inducing anomalous basin-scale wind stress. The KE jet is thus an integrated system involving the jet and the eddies, possibly feeding back to, and paced by, wind stress anomalies.

ID MEDITERRANEAN SEA; VARIABILITY; SURFACE; SYSTEM
AB A novel bias adjustment technique for 2D directional wave spectra is presented, which accounts for the intra-annual temporal variability of waves and the conservation of the wave energy integrated parameter and its extreme distribution, allowing for shifts in frequency and direction given by the global climate model and regional climate model (GCM-RCM) climate signal for the complete multimodal energy distribution. This work is the first attempt to address the biases inherent in GCM-RCM wave spectrum simulations for an assessment of the magnitudes of the projected changes in a climate change scenario. The bias-correction method is applied to a multimodel ensemble of 17 EURO-CORDEX regional simulations of wave spectra in 11 locations of the Mediterranean Sea. Climate change impacts are assessed by means of the changes between the bias-adjusted ensemble and hindcast wave spectra for mid-century conditions from 2034 until 2060 and end-of-century conditions from 2074 until 2100. The results highlight the need for novel bias-correction techniques that address the complexity of the possible directional and frequency shifts due to climate change, in order to provide an accurate assessment of projected future changes in the wave climate.

AB Multi-purpose floating platforms are emerging as a promising concept in ocean engineering applications, thanks to their capability of ensuring system integration, cost reduction and modularization. However, their increasing complexity requires the development of numerical tools, which need to be validated experimentally through adequate physical models. New challenges hence arise, since the subsystems integrated in the structure generally follow different scaling laws and may need relatively large physical models to achieve a reliable similitude between the full-scale structure and its physical model counterpart. The latter issue can be critical, because indoor tests in wave tanks and basins constrain the scale factors to the size of the available facilities. Open-sea experiments, albeit challenging because of the uncontrolled environmental conditions, could be a valid complement to the traditional indoor tests. This article proposes a review of the multi-physics scaling strategies for the subsystems usually embedded in multi-purpose floating platforms, i.e. floating support, mooring system, wind turbine, wave energy converter and aquaculture facilities, by providing a critical analysis on the relevance of the scaling factor and of the scaling strategy. The paper may also serve as a guide for practical applications involving one or several of the considered subsystems.

AB A comprehensive attempt has been made to simulate the characteristics of monsoon deep depressions (MDD) originating over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) basin, with special emphasis on their rainfall using a coupled ocean-atmospheric model, that is, the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment Transport (COAWST) model, and a stand-alone atmospheric model, that is, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, with a lead time of up to 72 hr. It is to be noted that COAWST employs WRF as its atmospheric component, while the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) is used as the oceanic component. It is found that though the tracks of the four MDDs considered have been reasonably simulated, the intensity was overestimated in both sets of simulations compared to India Meteorological Department (IMD) best estimates. Decomposition of the contributors to rain rate for the composite of the storms in the deep depression (DD) phase revealed that the moisture sources/sinks (Q(m)) are the major component in modulating the rain rate compared to the cloud sources/sinks. Further analysis of Q(m) suggested that vertical and horizontal advection of moisture forms the leading contributors to Q(m). Validation against Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Analysis (MERRA) reanalysis showed that COAWST captured a more realistic evolution of Q(m) (specifically vertical advection) compared to its stand-alone counterpart. Investigation of the composite storm energetics in a vortex-following control volume showed a scarcity of bulk kinetic energy (volume-integrated kinetic energy over the control volume) in the later hours of the DD phase in COAWST which led to the dissipation of the storm core, unlike in WRF, where a re-intensification took place through condensational heating. It is inferred that in spite of the stand-alone atmospheric model capturing the moisture incursion from the lateral boundaries in the lower levels significantly, the better representation of the vertical structure in COAWST led to more realistic simulations of the storms, increasing the skill in rainfall prediction.

AB Coastal waters are globally challenging areas to monitor not only because of the high resolution needed to resolve the scales at stake but also because most satellites are not yet suited to near-coast observations. We present here the analysis of an 8-year-long high-frequency RADAR (HFR) dataset off the coasts of Var region (France) in the North-Western Mediterranean Sea. Successive interruptions and errors intrinsic to the nature of the HFR remote-sensing technology have been compensated by the DINEOF statistical filling method. This unprecedented dataset enables the observation of many oceanic processes ranging from the interannual variability of large-scale structures to the identification of (sub)mesoscale features. Comparing and coupling this analysis with outputs from a regional ocean circulation model (GLAZUR), we also put emphasis on the extent of the possibilities of the HFR for the description of coastal surface circulation and its value as part of integrated observation systems. The data showed the diversity of the surface circulation in the region, mainly marked by the Northern boundary Current (NC), but undergoing a great variety of spatial and temporal fluctuations, interannually, seasonally, and at higher frequencies. Strong gusts of wind or regional upstream circulation can cause the undulations of the NC, modifying its shape and its strength, and fostering the emergence and zonal displacement of mesoscale to submesoscale eddies. Using an eddy tracking algorithm, we show that the occurrence of mesoscale eddies off this region display a strong inter-annual variability that is linked to the spatio-temporal variability of the NC's characteristics. The NC system thus plays an intermittent role as a transport carrier or barrier of heat, energy, or matter, which has important consequences for neighbouring coastal areas.

AB Morocco has experienced several years of drought, conventional water resources were insufficient to meet the needs of the population, which prompted the kingdom to seek other resources to ensure the supply of drinking water to this population. The most suitable solution was the desalination of seawater. In this context, the design and investigation of concentrated solar power (CSP) plant integrated with a desalination unit in Morocco are presented in this paper. The CSP part consists of a parabolic trough technology with a two-tank storage system, integrated with a power block of 111 MWe gross consisting of a conventional Rankine cycle. As for the desalination part, it consists of a Direct Contact Membrane Distillation System (DCMD) based on heat and mass transfer equations, and is solved numerically by MATLAB environment; the model was validated by means of the experimental data. The results show that the large-scale Parabolic Trough Collector (PTC) plants are more competitive in Dakhla -southern Morocco- where the annual energy generation and the capacity factor were estimated to be 493.8 GWh, and 47.6%, respectively. Whereas, the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) is 10.63c;/kWh. Furthermore, it has been found that in the DCMD system, an increase in the feed water temperature leads to an increase in permeate flux. Besides, freshwater production is highest in winters for Dakhla and Agadir (Atlantic Ocean) and it is highest in summers for Saidia and Al Hoceima (Mediterranean Sea). The lowest freshwater production cost is 0.84$/m(3) in Dakhla, followed by 0.98$/m(3) in Saidia, with the highest production cost at 1.20$/m(3) in Agadir.

AB Upwelling and downwelling processes play a critical role in the connectivity between offshore waters and coastal ecosystems, having relevant implications in terms of intense biogeochemical activity and global fisheries production. A variety of in situ and remote-sensing networks were used in concert with the Iberia-Biscay-Ireland (IBI) circulation forecast system, in order to investigate two persistent upwelling and downwelling events that occurred in the Northwestern (NW) Iberian coastal system during summer 2014. Special emphasis was placed on quality-controlled surface currents provided by a high-frequency radar (HFR), since this land-based technology can effectively monitor the upper layer flow over broad coastal areas in near-real time. The low-frequency spatiotemporal response of the ocean was explored in terms of wind-induced currents' structures and immediacy of reaction. Mean kinetic energy, divergence and vorticity maps were also calculated for upwelling and downwelling favorable events, in order to verify HFR and IBI capabilities, to accurately resolve the prevailing surface circulation features, such as the locus of a persistent upwelling maximum in the vicinity of Cape Finisterre. This integrated approach proved to be well-founded to efficiently portray the three-dimensional characteristics of the NW Iberian coastal upwelling system regardless of few shortcomings detected in IBI performance, such as the misrepresentation of the most energetic surface dynamics or the overestimation of the cooling and warming associated with upwelling and downwelling conditions, respectively. Finally, the variability of the NW Iberian upwelling system was characterized by means of the development of a novel ocean-based coastal upwelling index (UI), constructed from HFR-derived hourly surface current observations (UIHFR). The proposed UI(HFR)was validated against two traditional UIs for 2014, to assess its credibility. Results suggest that UI(HFR)was able to adequately categorize and characterize a wealth of summer upwelling and downwelling events of diverse length and strength, paving the way for future investigations of the subsequent biophysical implications.

AB Point absorber wave energy converters (PA-WECs) are considered an independent renewable energy resource in oceanographic research to study wave climate data, ocean navigation and maritime security. Their performance enhancement through optimally designed floats and power take-off (PTO) is a crucial challenge. The proposed study investigates the combined PA-WEC model, including (i) the hydrodynamic of the optimally designed topshaped buoy, (ii) non-linear characteristics of power take-off and (iii) self-stability of PA-WEC under the realtime wave climate of XiaoMaiDao wave station, Shandong, China. The proposed mechanical power take-off comprises a double-sided rack with gear transmission and three-phase DC generators. The components of the power take-off are symmetrically oriented on both sides of the rack to make it statically and dynamically balanced for the self-stability of the PA-WEC. The floating buoy absorbs kinetic energy from waves relative to a fixed point and transfers it to the PTO system. The PTO module alters the forward and reverted strokes of heaving motion into uni-directional rotations on the output shaft, employing a mechanical gearing mechanism with oneway bearings. Subsequently, supercapacitors store the rectified electrical energy in the power conversion and storage modules. The mechanical power take-off was initially modeled in MATLAB/Simscape and verified through experimental investigations using mechanical testing and sensing machine. Secondly, the hydrodynamics of the floating buoy was studied using frequency- and time-domain simulations in ANSYS AQWA. Thirdly, the wave tank tests were performed on a 1:25 scaled buoy in a wave tank, and the test results were validated against the time-domain simulations. Finally, the combined effects of power take-off and buoy were studied on the prototype scale, and it is concluded that at 1m significant wave height, the power take-off system integrated with the Cyl-AS buoy can generate 247.76W (RMS) with PTO efficiency of eta pto_rms = 76.37% at PA-WEC efficiency of eta wec_rms = 12.10%. Installing the proposed point absorber wave energy converter system along the offshore platforms can promote the UN-SDG-2030 Agenda, specifically the 7 and 14 goals, by supplying electricity for oceanographic applications.

AB A new type distributed benthic microbial fuel cell (MFC) (DBMFC) consisting of 18 MFC arrays was developed to enhance the robustness and stability of the power source for subsea sensor networks. A power management system (PMS) was integrated into the DBMFC system to boost the power output for two temperature sensors. The PMS was specifically designed with 18 charge pumps capable of simultaneously harvesting energy from 6 MFC units (18 anodes total) in the DBMFC system. The pilot scale DBMFC (total sediment volume: 1 m(3)) with continuous ocean water supply showed that the power outputs of individual MFC units were affected by the organic carbon and nitrogen contents in the sediment pore water. The MFC units with higher power output resulted in faster charging/discharging rate of the PMS supercapacitor. Manual disconnection of anodes from the PMS was conducted to simulate the anode malfunction caused by bioturbation. Fewer functional anodes (e.g. 12 out of 18 anodes were disconnected) slowed the charging/discharging rate of the PMS supercapacitor but still supported the PMS to regularly power two sensors. This scale-up DBMFC/PMS/sensor study demonstrated that multiple MFC units with multiple PMS substantially enhanced the stability and-robustness of power supply to subsea sensors.

AB The maritime industry has entered its pathway of decarbonization. To achieve the IMO's ambitious goals of an absolute emissions reduction of 50% by 2050, and a 70% carbon intensity reduction by 2050 compared to the 2008 level, various options for the adoption of technologies and alternative fuels are considered by the market stakeholders.Ammonia, one of the most promising alternative marine fuels has long been considered to reduce carbon emissions. And solid oxide fuel cell is expected to transform ship propulsion technology in the future due to its high utilization of fuels. In this paper, a feasibility study is performed to assess the application of an ammonia cracker-integrated solid oxide fuel cell (hereafter as Ammonia SOFC) system on an ocean-going vessel through a detailed CAPEX, FuelEX, OPEX, Carbon tax, and carbon emission analysis. Comparison is made with direct ammonia, LNG and conventional fuels fired heat engines. The result concludes that it can be economically viable to apply to deep-sea shipping, compared to other marine fuels and propulsion technologies.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB Internal Solitary Waves (ISWs) play a pivotal role in transporting energy and matter within the ocean and also pose substantial risks to ocean engineering, navigation, and underwater communication systems. Consequently, measures need to be adopted to alleviate their negative effects and minimize linked risks. An effective method entails extracting ISW positions from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for precise trajectory prediction and efficient avoidance strategies. However, manual extraction of ISWs from SAR data is time-consuming and prone to inaccuracies. Hence, it is imperative to develop a high-precision, rapid, and automated ISW-extraction algorithm. In this paper, we introduce Middle Transformer U-2-net (MTU2-net), an innovative model that integrates a distinctive loss function and Transformer to improve the accuracy of ISWs' extraction. The novel loss function enhances the model's capacity to extract bow waves, whereas the Transformer ensures coherence in ISW's patterns. By conducting experiments involving 762 image scenes, incorporating ISWs, from the South China Sea, we established a standardized dataset. The Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) achieved on this dataset was 71.57%, surpassing the performance of other compared methods. The experimental outcomes showcase the remarkable performance of our proposed model in precisely extracting bow wave attributes from SAR data.

AB Determination of energy transport is crucial for understanding the energy budget and fluid circulation in density varying fluids such as the ocean and the atmosphere. However, it is rarely possible to determine the energy flux field J = pu, which requires simultaneous measurements of the pressure and velocity perturbation fields p and u, respectively. We present a method for obtaining the instantaneous J(x, z, t) from density perturbations alone: A Green's function-based calculation yields p; u is obtained by integrating the continuity equation and the incompressibility condition. We validate our method with results from Navier-Stokes simulations: The Green's function method is applied to the density perturbation field from the simulations and the result for J is found to agree typically to within 1% with J computed directly using p and u from the Navier-Stokes simulation. We also apply the Green's function method to density perturbation data from laboratory schlieren measurements of internal waves in a stratified fluid and the result for J agrees to within 6% with results from Navier-Stokes simulations. Our method for determining the instantaneous velocity, pressure, and energy flux fields applies to any system described by a linear approximation of the density perturbation field, e.g., to small-amplitude lee waves and propagating vertical modes. The method can be applied using our MATLAB graphical user interface EnergyFlux.

TI Enhancing wave energy harvesting through integration of IEA 15 MW wind
   turbine on oscillating water columns equipped platform
SO OCEAN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID DYNAMIC-RESPONSE; PERFORMANCE; ARRAYS
AB The high costs associated with wave energy, encompassing substantial initial investments and ongoing operation and maintenance expenses, present significant obstacles to its widespread adoption and the realization of full-scale projects. To address this challenge, one promising strategy involves deploying robust wave energy converters within arrays integrated into platforms that also support wind turbines. This study introduces a novel hybrid energy harvesting platform featuring an IEA 15 MW wind turbine mounted on an oscillating water column-equipped platform previously developed by the authors. A time-domain analysis is performed using a numerical framework that integrates the FAST tool modules, including AeroDyn for aerodynamics and ElastoDyn for structural dynamics, alongside an analytical approach to model hydrodynamic interactions between oscillating water column units and incident waves, as well as the platform's motion response. The study is structured into three primary sections. The first section evaluates the wind turbine's response under calm water. The second section investigates platform motion and turbine response from startup to steady-state in regular waves. The third section analyzes power performance and platform behavior under varying wave periods and directions. The In-Situ Interaction Factor (ISIF), originally proposed by the authors, represents the ratio of the energy harvested from ocean waves by an array of PTO systems operating together to the sum of the energy captured by each PTO device in isolation, when the devices are positioned far apart. Results from the proposed hybrid energy harvesting platform demonstrate promising outcomes, notably achieving a ISIF of 16, which represents an eightfold increase compared to configurations without wind turbines. This means that through this platform, wave energy harvesting achieves a sixteenfold increase in the aggregate energy yield compared to the total energy output of all isolated harvesting units combined. This improvement is attributed to controlled pitch and roll (both less than 1 degrees at maximum) and the constructive interaction of OWCs in resonant conditions. The study validates these findings by comparing adapted methodologies with experimental data from a 1:50 scale model wave basin test of the DeepCwind-OWC.

AB We examine the dependence of the penetration depth and fractional surface area (e.g., whitecap coverage) of bubble plumes generated by breaking surface waves on various wind and wave parameters over a wide range of sea state conditions in the North Pacific Ocean, including storms with sustained winds up to 22 m s-1 and significant wave heights up to 10 m. Our observations include arrays of freely drifting SWIFT buoys together with shipboard systems, which enabled concurrent high-resolution measurements of wind, waves, bubble plumes, and turbulence. We estimate bubble plume penetration depth from echograms extending to depths of more than 30 m in a surface-following reference frame collected by downward-looking echosounders integrated onboard the buoys. Our observations indicate that mean and maximum bubble plume penetration depths exceed 10 and 30 m beneath the surface during high winds, respectively, with plume residence times of many wave periods. They also establish strong correlations between bubble plume depths and wind speeds, spectral wave steepness, and whitecap coverage. Interestingly, we observe a robust linear correlation between plume depths, when scaled by the total significant wave height, and the inverse of wave age. However, scaled plume depths exhibit non-monotonic variations with increasing wind speeds. Additionally, we explore the dependencies of the combined observations on various non-dimensional predictors used for whitecap coverage estimation. This study provides the first field evidence of a direct relation between bubble plume penetration depth and whitecap coverage, suggesting that the volume of bubble plumes could be estimated by remote sensing.
   Quantifying the statistics of bubble plumes generated during ocean surface wave breaking is essential to understanding the exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere. Bubble plumes also cause important variations in underwater acoustics and optics. Recent studies also suggest that the statistics of bubble plumes are skillful predictors for total energy loss during wave breaking, which is an essential quantity for accurate wave forecasting. In this study, we examine how these bubble plume statistics change with different wind and wave conditions, including during storms. We used echosounders on drifting buoys to detect the bubbles and estimate how deep they go in the ocean. We also used shipboard camera systems to measure the surface area of the bubble plumes. We successfully develop multiple empirical relationships that allow us to predict how bubble plume depth and surface area change as a function of simple wind and wave statistics. These statistics are readily available from existing forecast models or typical ocean buoys. Our findings reveal that bubble plume depth is correlated with its visible surface area. This intriguing correlation suggests that we might estimate the volume of bubble plumes simply by observing the ocean surface from above.
   Bubble plumes generated during ocean surface wave breaking are observed with echosounders on drifting buoys Bubble plume depths are well correlated with whitecap coverage, wind speed, and spectral wave steepness Bubble plumes persist for many wave periods and exceed the persistence of visible surface foam

AB According to climate science, ocean warming is one of the current and future greatest threats to coastal ecosystems. Projection scenarios for the end of this century show that tropical intertidal ecosystems are particularly at risk. In this study we optimized and tested a holistic method for bio-monitoring present and projected thermal pressure in such ecosystems, in order to assess organism vulnerability to ocean warming. Several species representative of different animal groups (fish, crustaceans and gastropods) were collected from the field and subjected to an experimental trial for 28 days, testing two temperatures: control (present seawater summer temperature) and elevated temperature (+3 degrees C, projected seawater temperature anomaly for 2100). Muscle samples were collected weekly to quantify several biomarkers of: i) macromolecular damage (protein unfolding and denaturation, and lipid peroxidation), ii) reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers (antioxidant enzymes), and iii) body condition (energy reserves and body mass). These biomarkers were combined in integrated biomarker response (IBR) indices, either in three separate stress response categories (as previously defined) or in a unique combined analysis of overall physiological performance. Both approaches suggest that temperature affected IBRs, with increasing temperatures significantly impairing the overall health of individuals. Biomarkers of lower levels of biological organization indicated deleterious effects of temperature, whereas biomarkers of higher levels suggested maintenance of performance after chronic exposure. Overall indices combining the estimates of biomarkers across levels of biological organization are essential to predict the vulnerability of species, or populations, to climate warming. Such indices may assist managers and stakeholders in the establishment of monitoring programs and environmental policies toward the conservation of fragile coastal systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Global climate change affects marine fish through drivers such as ocean warming, acidification and oxygen depletion, causing changes in marine ecosystems and socioeconomic impacts. While experimental and observational results can inform about anticipated effects of different drivers, linking between these results and ecosystem-level changes requires quantitative integration of physiological and ecological processes into models to advance research and inform management. We give an overview of important physiological and ecological processes affected by environmental drivers. We then provide a review of available modelling approaches for marine fish, analysing their capacities for process-based integration of environmental drivers. Building on this, we propose approaches to advance important research questions. Examples of integration of environmental drivers exist for each model class. Recent extensions of modelling frameworks increase the potential for including detailed mechanisms and improving model projections. Experimental results on energy allocation, behaviour and physiological limitations will advance the understanding of organism-level trade-offs and thresholds in response to multiple drivers. More explicit representation of life cycles and biological traits can improve description of population dynamics and adaptation, and data on food web topology and feeding interactions help to detail the conditions for possible regime shifts. Identification of relevant processes will also benefit the coupling of different models to investigate spatial-temporal changes in stock productivity and integrated responses of social-ecological systems. Thus, a more process-informed foundation for models will promote the integration of experimental and observational results and increase the potential for model-based extrapolations into a future under changing environmental conditions.

AB The South China Sea Warm Current (SCSWC) has drawn considerable attentions in the past decade due to its characteristic of flowing against the wind direction along the coast of Southeast China during winter. Observational monitoring of the SCSWC is yet insufficient to firmly assess of the property of this current. Prior modeling attempts have been carried out in idealized or simplified framework, e.g., coarse resolution, unrealistic wind forcing, artificial bathymetry, and/or missing dynamical processes. It is still unclear to what extent the above approximations may affect the properties of the SCSWC. In this study, a state-of-the-art data assimilation system of the South China Sea has been integrated from 1993 to 2005. The system uses the Hybrid Ocean Model (HYCOM) with tidal forcing and is forced with realistic atmospheric forcing. In order to ensure a more realistic positioning of the mesoscale features, the system assimilates along-track altimetry data with the Ensemble Optimal Interpolation (EnOI) to investigate the properties of the SCSWC for the period 1996-2005. The properties of the SCSWC in winter time are investigated and found: the current mainly follows the 100 m isobaths and exists from immediately below the surface to the depth of 50 m with a baroclinic structure; the main core is located at 20-30 m depths and is composed of water warmer than the shelf water; and the width of the current is less than 100 km. Meanwhile, based on the daily output, it was shown that the current is highly transient in January. Additional simulations without tidal forcing and without assimilation suggest that the transient property of the current is mainly driven by the atmospheric forcing while the mesoscale eddies enhance its variability. On the contrary, tidal forcing seems to reduce the strength of the SCSWC, as expected from tidal rectifying of the current.

AB Soil moisture and temperature are significant variables in numerical weather prediction systems and land surface models, controlling the partitioning of moisture and energy fluxes at the surface. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is an approximation to the Kalman filter in that background error covariances are estimated from a finite ensemble of forecasts. The EnKF technique is now widely applied in data assimilation of the atmosphere, ocean and land surface. In the current GRAPES_Meso model version V4.0, the land surface soil assimilation method has not been integrated for land surface assimilation. Therefore, in this work, an EnKF has been introduced in the GRAPES_Meso model using air temperature at 2 m and the relative humidity at 2 m and its performance has been evaluated in land surface assimilation. The results show that the land surface assimilation method can effectively improve the performance skill of air temperature at 2 m and it has little effect on precipitation.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are one of the most important means of ocean exploration. However, the restricted energy supply poses a significant challenge to the advancement and practical application of AUVs. Based on the structural characteristics, this paper proposes a novel AUV, which integrates a deformable doublefloat wave energy converter (WEC), called DFWEC-AUV. The DFWEC empowers the AUV to capture wave energy to supply itself by oscillating double-float form in power generation mode. The structural design, focusing on the deformable float (DeF) and the onboard damping plate (DP), and the working principle, including mode switching and energy capture, are firstly introduced. Then, a double-float dynamic model of DFWEC-AUV oscillating in regular waves is established to reveal the energy capture mechanism in both frequency-domain and time-domain. Finally, the influence of the presence of DP, structural parameters (diameter of DP and deployment angle of DeF) and power take-off (PTO) system damping coefficient on the dynamic response characteristics and energy capture performance is analyzed. In addition, to verify the effectiveness of the performance analysis, a comparative simulation of parameter optimization is carried out under actual wave excitation. The results show that the addition of onboard DP is able to effectively enhance the energy capture performance of DFWEC-AUV, as well as increase the energy capture bandwidth. Moreover, the larger the diameter of the DP is, the greater the performance improvement of DFWEC-AUV is. Conversely, increasing the deployment angle of the DeF does not necessarily lead to better power capture performance. Additionally, it is observed that waves of a particular period are consistently associated with an optimal PTO damping coefficient, which leads to superior power capture performance. In comparative simulation, the energy capture performance of DFWEC-AUV after parameter optimization is increased by 4.7 times.

AB In nutrient-limited conditions, phytoplankton growth at fronts is enhanced by winds, which drive upward nutrient fluxes via enhanced turbulent mixing and upwelling. Hence, depth-integrated phytoplankton biomass can be 10 times greater at isolated fronts. Using theory and two-dimensional simulations with a coupled physical-biogeochemical ocean model, this paper builds conceptual understanding of the physical processes driving upward nutrient fluxes at fronts forced by unsteady winds with timescales of 4-16 days. The largest vertical nutrient fluxes occur when the surface mixing layer penetrates the nutricline, which fuels phytoplankton in the mixed layer. At a front, mixed layer deepening depends on the magnitude and direction of the wind stress, cross-front variations in buoyancy and velocity at the surface, and potential vorticity at the base of the mixed layer, which itself depends on past wind events. Consequently, mixing layers are deeper and more intermittent in time at fronts than outside fronts. Moreover, mixing can decouple in time from the wind stress, even without other sources of physical variability. Wind-driven upwelling also enhances depth-integrated phytoplankton biomass at fronts; when the mixed layer remains shallower than the nutricline, this results in enhanced subsurface phytoplankton. Oscillatory along-front winds induce both oscillatory and mean upwelling. The mean effect of oscillatory vertical motion is to transiently increase subsurface phytoplankton over days to weeks, whereas slower mean upwelling sustains this increase over weeks to months. Taken together, these results emphasize that wind-driven phytoplankton growth is both spatially and temporally intermittent and depends on a diverse combination of physical processes.

AB Effluents from urban wastewater treatment plants (UWWTPs) discharged into water bodies such as the sea or ocean, offer a potential source of renewable energy through the salinity gradient (SGE) between seawater and treated water. The European project Life-3E: Environment-Energy-Economy aims to demonstrate an innovative process integrating renewable energy production with water reclamation. Using reverse electrodialysis (RED) technology, SGE can power tertiary wastewater treatment processes in coastal UWWTPs, offsetting energy costs associated with water regeneration and reuse. This study pioneers a pilot-scale RED system with a 20.125 m(2) membrane area at a coastal UWWTP in Comillas, Spain. The initial tests with synthetic solutions in the up-scaled RED module have reached a peak power density of 1.39 W/m(2). Under real environmental conditions, using natural seawater and treated water at ambient temperatures (289 +/- 0.5 K), the system achieved a peak power density of 0.95 W/m(2), outperforming previous setups in stability and efficiency. The results show competitive energy metrics, with an energy efficiency of 1.9 W/m(2)& sdot;m3LC and up to 38.2 Wh/ m(3)LC generated. The treated water, with an inlet conductivity to the RED stack of <1 mS/cm, exits the pilot with a conductivity of around 4 mS/cm (measured under a load of 2A and a flow rate of 500 L/h), maintaining the quality standards for urban reuse. This study demonstrates the effective integration of RED technology into water reclamation stages, creating a self-sustained energy loop and enhancing the efficiency in water management. By harnessing blue energy and supporting sustainable water reuse, this research contributes to the global shift toward a circular water economy and critical sustainability goals.

AB Mass manufactured, biologically inspired soft robots are needed for safe robot-animal interactions. The key challenges are the design and manufacture of high-performance robots that meet stringent requirements in ocean environments. This work describes a 92% 3D-printed jellyfish-inspired soft robot, SoJel, which uses soft polymers for the bell and sensors. We show how slight variations in geometry affects the swimming performance of the robot, which demonstrates the need for advanced or custom-made 3D printers that avoid the difficulties in realizing controlled geometries by using traditional molding and casting techniques. The design reproduces important kinematic patterns of natural jellyfish, like the bell bending angle, actuation duty cycle, and bell ki-nematics. This work builds on previous generations of jellyfish-inspired robots that employed various types of actuators, but is largely polymer based, so it avoids metallic components that are susceptible to corrosion in the ocean. The realized cost of transport and vertical swimming height of robots powered by coiled nickel-titanium actuators are comparable to previous designs, however, the present robots have advantages in ease of design and manufacturing. A variety of soft robots and flexible structures can potentially be fabricated using this design principle. Flexible 3D-printed soft sensors enable us to determine the bending angles for motion estimation and control. Energy harvesting from water oscillation or free vibration is demonstrated using a twistron harvester and a piezoelectric composite integrated into the robot, which can be used for powering electronics, such as a LED for display and communication.

TI Sustainability implications of different carbon dioxide removal
   technologies in the context of Europe's climate neutrality goal
SO SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION

   Ocean-enhanced weathering; Terrestrial-enhanced weathering; Direct air
   carbon capture and storage (DACCS)
AB The role of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is undoubtedly crucial in achieving the climate goals and end-ofcentury global warming target. Given its role as a leader in global climate actions, the European Union (EU) is expected to take a leading role in CDR developments: yet there is a lack of depth in the region's CDR strategy and deployment. A comprehensive CDR approach based on integrated assessment modelling for the EU is important to give valuable insights into optimal CDR-based mitigation pathways regarding scalability, technology readiness, trade-offs with the Earth system, and deployment strategies. Here, we have used the GCAMCDR v1.0 to model a diverse novel CDR portfolio of bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS), direct air capture and carbon storage (DACCS), terrestrial enhanced weathering (TEW), and ocean-enhanced weathering (OEW) in a mid-century carbon neutrality target. We find that CO2 removal by BECCS scales quickly to gigatonnes of CO2 removal by mid-century, and DACCS is a latter-century mitigation technology in the EU's emission mitigation pathway. TEW will play a crucial role in achieving carbon neutrality in the EU if this climate goal is advanced by a decade. Modelled results show that achieving carbon neutrality through diverse CDR relies heavily on significant emission reductions in the industrial and hard-to-abate sectors. Finally, we observed that nuclear power will be an important energy resource for the energy-consuming CDR technologies in Europe. This study recommends that the EU carbon removal structure should not be limited to DACCS, but rather allow for innovations in carbon removal technologies. Synopsis: Achieving the EU's carbon neutrality targets requires a diversified Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) strategy, with BECCS identified as a scalable solution by mid-century and nuclear energy as a key support for energy-intensive CDR technologies.

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACT; OCEAN; SURFACE; SYSTEM
AB A state-of-the-art regional assessment of future directional wave spectra in the Mediterranean Sea and the projected changes with respect to hindcast is presented. A multi-model EURO-CORDEX regional ensemble of bias-adjusted wave climate projections in eleven locations of the Mediterranean are used for the assessment of future seasonal changes in the directional wave spectra under the high-emission scenario RCP8.5. This analysis allows us to identify climate change effects on the spectral energy of the swell and wind-sea systems and their seasonal variability which cannot be captured with the standard integrated wave parameters, such as significant wave height and mean wave direction. The results show an overall robust decrease in the predominant wave systems, resulting in a likely decrease in the significant wave height that is in agreement with previous studies. However, the results depict a robust increase in other less energetic frequencies and directions leading to a projected behavioral change from unimodal to bimodal/multimodal wave climate in many locations which has strong repercussions on the vulnerability of coastal assets and ports operability.

AB Despite their potential as a naturally-available clean energy option, the renewable energy resources of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (i.e., North Korea) have rarely been evaluated. Therefore, to estimate the availability of land surface solar irradiance necessary for solar applications and to model available energy potential, physically-based models drawing on Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) data and associated statistics for key atmospheric constituents, were employed. To assess wind energy resources, model output statistics (MOS) were integrated from post-processed Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System (LDAPS) variables, thereby removing any systematic bias arising from long-term regression methods. The root mean square error (RMSE) and mean bias error (MBE) served to compare pyranometer- and satellite-sourced solar radiation, under instantaneous (87.90 W m(-2) and 16.84 W m(-2), respectively) and daily 'all sky conditions' (624.98 Wh m(-)(2) d(-1) and 13.89 Wh m(-2) d(-1), respectively). These low values indicate that satellite-based solar irradiance is sufficiently accurate to be used to model future land surface solar energy in North Korea. In the evaluation of wind energy resources, daily wind speeds obtained from Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) reanalysis fields showed good accuracy compared to a meteorological tower measurement (RMSE = 0.37 m s(-1) and MBE = 0.24 m s(-1)). In the study region, mean wind energy potential (from 2013-2015) was 3.44 kWh m(-2) d(-1), whereas solar energy potential was slightly lower at 3.36 kWh m(-2) d(-1); this can be attributed to the nation's mountainous terrain and high latitude. Although the region's mountainous terrain may be an obstacle for future development of renewable energy infrastructure, these initial annual mean solar and wind power density results illustrate the significant renewable energy potential of North Korea. This situates the country in a position to promote the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG #7) of integrating cleaner and more sustainable energy resources through solar and wind power.

AB Aqueous batteries, particularly those integrating organic active materials functioning in a neutral pH environment, stand out as highly promising contenders in the stationary electrochemical storage domain, owing to their unparalleled safety, sustainability, and low-cost materials. Herein, a novel di-block oligomer, serving as the negative electrode of an all-organic aqueous battery, is shown to offer exceptional output capabilities. The battery's performance is further enhanced by a unique intermixed p/n-type storage mechanism, which is able to simultaneously exchange light and naturally abundant Na+, Mg2+, and Cl-. Reaching up to 105 mAh g(-1), this system shows remarkable capacity retention for several thousand cycles (6500 cycles, approximate to 40 days) in various neutral electrolytes, including raw ocean water (approximate to 3000 cycles, approximate to 75 days). The surprisingly fast kinetics of this di-block oligomer allow to attain an unmatched specific capacity of near to 60 mAh g(electrode)(-1) while entirely devoid of conducting additives, and more than 80 mAh g(electrode)(-1) with 10% carbon additive, as well as displaying an areal capacity as high as 3.4 mAh cm(-2) at C rate. Full cell validation was demonstrated over 1600 cycles by virtue of a commercial 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO) molecule, which permitted an energy density of close to 40 Wh kg(materials)(-1) at C rate in a self-pH-buffered and inexpensive aqueous electrolyte.

AB Current earth observation models do not take into account the influence of water salinity on the evaporation rate, even though the salinity influences the evaporation rate by affecting the density and latent heat of vaporization. In this paper, we adapt the SEBS (Surface Energy Balance System) model for large water bodies and add the effect of water salinity to the evaporation rate. Firstly, SEBS is modified for fresh-water whereby new parameterizations of the water heat flux and sensible heat flux are suggested. This is achieved by adapting the roughness heights for momentum and heat transfer. Secondly, a salinity correction factor is integrated into the adapted model. Eddy covariance measurements over Lake IJsselmeer (The Netherlands) are carried out and used to estimate the roughness heights for momentum (similar to 0.0002 m) and heat transfer (similar to 0.0001 m). Application of these values over the Victoria and Tana lakes (freshwater) in Africa showed that the calculated latent heat fluxes agree well with the measurements. The root mean-square of relative-errors (rRMSE) is about 4.1% for Lake Victoria and 4.7%, for Lake Tana. Verification with ECMWF data showed that the salinity reduced the evaporation at varying levels by up to 27% in the Great Salt Lake and by 1% for open ocean. Our results show the importance of salinity to the evaporation rate and the suitability of the adapted-SEBS model (AquaSEBS) for fresh and saline waters.

AB Aquatic mobile robots are gaining attention for their potential to revolutionize marine monitoring and exploration within the Ocean Internet of Things. A significant challenge for these untethered robots, especially in remote areas, is achieving energy autonomy. This work presents an innovative self-sustaining energy system for compact aquatic robots, inspired by biological digestion. Utilizing microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology, organic materials found in aquatic environments are converted into electricity through catalytic redox reactions. To extend the MFC's lifespan, spore-forming Bacillus subtilis is used as the anodic biocatalyst, leveraging its ability to endure harsh conditions and reactivate in favorable environments, thus enhancing the MFC's longevity. To ensure a steady supply of organic substrates for microbial viability, a biomimetic Janus membrane with asymmetric surface wettability is integrated, enabling selective substrate intake. Additionally, stability mechanisms inspired by water striders allow the robot to move efficiently across water surfaces. The robot mimics the water strider's movement using a motor powered by microbial metabolism, fueled by organic nutrients via the Janus membrane. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using natural processes for technological advancement, setting new benchmarks in the design of autonomous systems.
   The paper introduces a novel energy system for compact aquatic robots inspired by biological digestion. It employs microbial fuel cell technology, utilizing organic materials in water to generate electricity. The system features Bacillus subtilis for resilience and extended lifespan, and incorporates a biomimetic membrane and locomotion mechanisms mimicking the water strider. This innovative approach enhances oceanic exploration and marine environment stewardship. image

AB A global prognostic model based on MOM4p1, which is a primitive equation nonBoussinesq numerical model, has been integrated with 1 400 years from the state of rest based on the realistic topography to study the long-term pattern of combined wind-driven and thermodynamically-driven general circulation. The model is driven by monthly climatological mean forces and includes 192 x 189 horizontal grids and 31 pressure-based vertical levels. The main objective is to investigate the mass and heat transports at interbasin passages and their compensations and roles in the global ocean circulation under equilibrium state of long-term spin up. The kinetic energy analysis divides the spin up process into three stages: the quasi-stable state of wind driven current, the growing phase of thermodynamical circulation and the equilibrium state of thermohaline circulation. It is essential to spin up over a thousand years in order to reach the thermohaline equilibrium state from a state of rest. The Arctic Throughflow from the Bering Strait to the Greenland Sea and the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) are captured and examined with their compensations and existing data. Analysis reveals that the slope structures of sea surface height are the dynamical driving mechanism of the Pacific-Arctic-Atlantic throughflow and ITF. The analysis denotes, in spite of O (1.4 x 10(6) m(3)/s) of the southward volume transport in the northern Atlantic, that there is still O (1 PW) of heat transported northward since the northward currents in the upper layer carry much higher temperature water than the southward flowing northern Atlantic deep water (NADW). Meridional volume and heat transports are focused on the contributions to NADW renewals and Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). Quantitative descriptions of the interbasin exchanges are explained by meridional compensations and supported by previous observations and numerical modeling results. Analysis indicates that the volume and heat exchanges on the interbasin passages proposed in this article manifest their hub roles in the Great Ocean Conveyor System.

AB Large-scale floating photovoltaics (FPV) are garnering increased attention as a sustainable solution for renewable energy production and efficient utilization of ocean spaces. These FPV arrays are predominantly deployed in shallow water environments, which present significant challenges in mooring system design due to substantial tidal fluctuations. In such settings, mooring systems may become slack and lose functionality at low tide or risk damage from excessive stiffness at high tide. The primary aim of this study is to develop a mooring system tailored to FPV arrays, capable of withstanding extensive tidal variations without causing damage to the floating modules due to high mooring line tension. Employing HydroD, a hydrodynamic analysis tool based on potential flow theory, alongside OrcaFlex, a time-domain coupled analysis tool predicated on the lumped mass method, we conducted a comparative assessment of six distinct mooring configurations. These configurations, varying in mooring line materials and components, were evaluated from static, dynamic, and fatigue analysis standpoints across a range of tidal levels. The results indicate that taut mooring systems integrated with buoys or clumps consistently exhibit superior performance in all test scenarios. Accordingly, these systems are highly recommended for securing FPV arrays in shallow water environments characterized by severe tidal variations, offering optimal stability and resilience.

AB This article proposes a non-linear vibro-impact mechanism, integrated inside a semi-submerged cylindrical buoy to form a self-contained and self-referenced vibro-impact wave energy converter (VIWEC), for performance enhancement. A non-linear mathematical model of the VIWEC is derived, considering linear wave-buoy interaction and non-linear vibro-impact mechanics. Numerical simulations are conducted to investigate the influence of the vibro-impact mechanism on the VIWEC's dynamics and performance. Numerical results conclude that the VIWEC is characterised by a band-pass frequency response and inherently decoupled from ocean waves of low frequencies, indicating high survivability under extreme sea states. The vibro-impact mechanism can also broaden the VIWEC's power capture bandwidth and limit the VIWEC's motion within its physical constraint. On the other hand, the VIWEC's dynamics are sensitive to design parameters, and an improper design may lead to rich and complex non-linear dynamics of the VIWEC, e.g. chaos and multi-stability. The proposed non-linear model can provide a platform for design optimisation and control development of the VIWEC.

AB Ocean acidification (OA) is one of the greatest threats to marine species, with widespread impacts on their physiological functions. However, the adaptive capacities of many marine species to OA and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of short-term (4 days) and medium-term (30 days) CO2 exposure (pH 8.0, 7.6, and 7.3) on black rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii), focusing on histopathological changes in gill tissues, ion transport biomarkers, oxidative stress indicators, and transcriptomic responses. The results showed that both short-term and medium-term OA induced significant morphological changes in gill tissues, including epithelial lifting, hyperplasia, hypertrophy, and lamellar clubbing, which are likely adaptive mechanisms for maintaining homeostasis. Both Na+/K+-ATPase and carbonic anhydrase (CA) activities increased significantly in both short- and medium-term exposure, while Ca2+-ATPase activity was elevated only in the short-term, suggesting differential enzyme regulation over time to sustain ionic balance. Additionally, oxidative stress indicators (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)) were significantly elevated after both exposure durations, indicating that the antioxidant defense system was activated. Moreover, the integrated biomarker response (IBR) index further indicated that the stress response was more pronounced during short-term exposure. Transcriptomic analysis reveals significant alterations in pathways related to calcium signaling, cytoskeletal structure, energy metabolism, and oxidative stress following short-term exposure. In contrast, medium-term exposure leads to significant enrichment of pathways associated with cell-environment interactions, highlighting the molecular adaptations of S. schlegelii to OA-induced stress. These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of OA tolerance in S. schlegelii and contribute to understanding the adaptability of marine species in future ocean environments.

AB There are two distinctly different views on Quaternary sedimentation rates in the central Arctic Ocean, namely, that they were on cm/kyr or on mm/kyr scales, largely as a result of divergent interpretations of magnetic reversal stratigraphy. This study provides new evidence to help resolve this controversy in the form of an almost 1-m-thick negative polarity interval located at similar to 1.15 m below the seafloor in a 4.15-m-long sediment core from the Lomonosov Ridge, central Arctic Ocean. This thick polarity anomaly was first revealed through alternating field demagnetization of natural remanent magnetization on u-channel samples. It was subsequently confirmed to be an authentic signal of a syndepositional geomagnetic field by integrating detailed rock magnetic studies, transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses of magnetic extracts, and both alternating field and thermal demagnetization of discrete paleomagnetic samples. Here we conclude that it is more reasonable to interpret the reversed interval as a record of the Matuyama Chron rather than a Brunhes-aged excursion, which yields mean sedimentation rates of similar to 1.5 mm/kyr and similar to 0.5 mm/kyr in the Brunhes and Matuyama Chrons, respectively. These estimates are remarkably lower than assumed in most recent studies, but in good agreement with both previous magnetostratigraphic and recent geochemical studies relative to the decay of Be and U-series isotopes, which might indicate "sediment-starved" environments at least in some parts of this region. Overall, our results not only imply that chronostratigraphy in the central Arctic Ocean remains open to debate but also warrant further investigations in this microfossil-barren region.

AB The study has shown that the shear component of the vertical integrated kinetic energy (K-s) over the box (40 degrees E-100 degrees E, 0-20 degrees N) can be used to measure the intensity of the South Asian summer monsoon (SASM). Based on its value averaged between June and August, the SASM can be divided into strong and weak monsoon episodes. Between 1958 and 2018, there existed 16 (16) strong (weak) monsoon episodes. Based on the calendar year, the relationship between the SASM and ENSO episodes can be grouped into six patterns: weak monsoon - El Nino (WM-EN), normal monsoon - El Nino (NM-EN), weak monsoon - non ENSO (WM-NE), strong monsoon - La Nina (SM-LN), normal monsoon - La Nina (NM-LN) and strong monsoon - non ENSO (SM-NE). Previous studies suggest that the WM-EN and SM-LN patterns reflect the correlated relationship between the SASM and El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Therefore, we name these two strongly coupled categories WM-EN and SM-LN as the resonance effect. Two important circulations, i.e., Walker circulation (WC) and zonal Asian monsoon circulation (MC), in the vertical plane arc found to be not always correlated. The MC is controlled by thermal gradients between the Asian landmass and the tropical Indian Ocean, while the WC associated with ENSO events is primarily the east-west thermal gradient between the tropical South Pacific and the tropical Indian Ocean. Furthermore, the gradient directions caused by different surface thermal conditions are different. The main factor for the resonance effect is the phenomenon that the symbols of SSTA in the tropical Indian Ocean and the equatorial eastern Pacific are the same, but are opposite to that of the SSTA near the maritime continent.

AB Understanding the interaction of tides and waves is essential in many studies, including marine renewable energy, sediment transport, long-term seabed morphodynamics, storm surges and the impacts of climate change. In the present research, a COAWST model of the NW European shelf seas has been developed and applied to a number of physical processes. Although many aspects of wave-current interaction can be investigated by this model, our focus is on the interaction of barotropic tides and waves at shelf scale. While the COWAST model was about five times more computationally expensive than running decoupled ROMS (ocean model) and SWAN (wave model), it provided an integrated modelling system which could incorporate many wave-tide interaction processes, and produce the tide and wave parameters in a unified file system with a convenient post-processing capacity. Some applications of the model such as the effect of tides on quantifying the wave energy resource, which exceeded 10% in parts of the region, and the effect of waves on the calculation of the bottom stress, which was dominant in parts of the North Sea and Scotland, during an energetic wave period are presented, and some challenges are discussed. It was also shown that the model performance in the prediction of the wave parameters can improve by 25% in some places where the wave-tide interaction is significant.

AB Accurately representing diurnal and semidiurnal internal variability is necessary to investigate inner-shelf to midshelf exchange processes. Here, a coupled Regional Ocean Model System (ROMS)-Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN) model is compared to observed diurnal and semidiurnal internal tidal variability on the mid and inner shelf (26-8 m water depth) near San Pedro Bay, California. Modeled mean stratification is about one-half of that observed. Modeled and observed baroclinic velocity rotary spectra are similar in the diurnal and semidiurnal band. Modeled and observed temperature spectra have similar diurnal and semidiurnal band structure, although the modeled is weaker. The observed and modeled diurnal and semidiurnal baroclinic velocity- and temperature-dominant vertical structures are similar and consistent with mode-one internal motions. Both observed and modeled diurnal baroclinic kinetic energy are strongly correlated to diurnal wind forcing and enhanced by subtidal vorticity-induced reduction in the inertial frequency. The mid- and inner-shelf modeled diurnal depth-integrated heat budget is a balance between advective heat flux divergence and temperature time derivative. Temperature-velocity phase indicates progressive semidiurnal internal tide on the midshelf and largely standing internal tide on the inner shelf in both observed and modeled. The ratio of observed to modeled inferred phase speed is consistent with the observed to modeled stratification. The San Pedro Bay modeled semidiurnal internal tide has significant spatial variability, variable incident wave angles, and multiple local generation sites. Overall, the coupled ROMS-SWAN model represents well the complex diurnal and semidiurnal internal variability from the mid to the inner shelf.

AB The emergy accounting method has been widely applied to terrestrial and marine ecosystems although there is a lack of emergy studies focusing on phytoplankton primary production. Phytoplankton production is a pivotal process since it is intimately coupled with oceanic food webs, energy fluxes, carbon cycle, and Earth's climate. In this study, we proposed a new methodology to perform a biophysical assessment of the global phytoplankton primary production combining Machine Learning (ML) techniques and an emergy-based accounting model. Firstly, we produced global phytoplankton production estimates using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. Secondly, we assessed the main energy inputs supporting the global phytoplankton production. Finally, we converted these inputs into emergy units and analysed the results from an ecological perspective. Among the energy flows, tides showed the highest maximum emergy contribution to global phytoplankton production highlighting the importance of thise flow in the complex dynamics of marine ecosystems. In addition, an emergy/ production ratio was calculated showing different global patterns in terms of emergy convergence into the primary production process. We believe that the proposed emergy-based assessment of phytoplankton production could be extremely valuable to improve our understanding of this key biological process at global scale adopting a systems perspective. This model can also provide a useful benchmark for future assessments of marine ecosystem services at global scale.

AB We investigate the performance of a novel power takeoff (PTO) featuring belt-arc speed amplification for oscillating surge wave energy converters (OSWECs), aiming to address the PTO design challenges of extremely low rotary speed and large torque under the low-frequency and large energy density ocean wave excitations. The belt-arc design significantly increases the rotary speed of the generator, enabling generator downsizing and decreasing the powertrain friction losses. The design also allows for placing the generator above water, eliminating the need for high Ingress Protection ratings for the generator and powertrain, and potentially leading to substantial reductions in capital and maintenance costs. Using the potential flow theory, the dynamics of the integrated system are analyzed, and key parameters are identified. To validate the numerical analysis, a 1:10 scale model is designed, fabricated, and tested in a wave tank. Performance evaluations are conducted under regular and irregular wave conditions, with quantified effects of parameter tuning. The results reveal an optimal wave-to-electric efficiency of 48% under regular wave excitation and 20% under irregular excitation. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the proposed novel PTO design in addressing the challenges of low rotation speed and large torque inherent in OSWECs, demonstrating its ability to efficiently convert wave power into electricity.

AB In tropical climates, the energy consumed by heating, ventilation and air conditioning can exceed 50% of the total energy consumption of a building. The demand for cooling is rising steadily, driven by global warming and rapidly increasing living standards in developing economies. In addition, there is a rise in water demand due to population increase, life quality, and global warming. Coastal areas with narrow continental shelves are the perfect site for implementing Seawater Air Conditioning (SWAC), a renewable and low CO2 emission cooling process. This article proposes the combination of SWAC6 and reverse osmosis (RO) desalination with the objective of providing desalinated cold water for integrated water supply and cooling services. This combination was named Deep Seawater Cooling and Desalination (DSCD). It was found that DSCD can supply 49 MWt of cooling and 1 m(3)/s of water simultaneously with an electricity consumption of 12 MWe. DSCD has several benefits compared to SWAC and RO individually, such as in how the cooling service and water supply are delivered together, reducing distribution costs. A case study was performed in Male acute accent , Maldives. It shows that the technology has substantial potential to contribute to the sustainable development of tropical islands.

AB The purpose of this article is to introduce an unmanned aerial swarm control strategy that has been developed specifically for the MBZIRC 2024 competition inspection task, which requires the UAV swarm to search within a global navigation satellite system-denied ocean space. The proposed approach utilizes control barrier functions (CBF) to encode the constraints and control each unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using an optimization-based method. We first establish the UAV model by taking energy consumption and the need for charging into consideration, which are then encoded using CBF. Following this, we propose a CBF that ensures each UAV maintains a certain distance from two selected UAVs or beacons on the coast, enabling the swarm to maintain a certain formation using localization algorithms by measuring relative distances. Finally, we present a CBF that integrates Lloyd's algorithm and variable density to enable the swarm to exhibit searching behavior. In numerical simulation with 14 searching UAVs and 3 beacon UAVs, the proposed algorithm shows great scalability and can successfully search the entire task area within 5 min, capable of handling all the constraints, i.e., localization distance, collision avoidance, energy consumption, and task performance, in the considered problem. In our physical experiment with 3 searching UAVs and 3 beacons, the proposed algorithm can accomplish the searching mission within 30 s.

DE Low-frequency radiated noise; active-passive hybrid isolation;

AB Low-frequency radiated noise, characterized by a distinctive "acoustic fingerprint" is generated when vibrations from marine machinery propagate through a ship's hull into the ocean. This type of noise travels long distances with concentrated and stable energy, posing a significant threat to a ship's acoustic stealth capabilities. Active-passive hybrid isolation is the primary method for reducing low-frequency radiated noise from ships; however, technical challenges remain, such as effectively integrating active and passive components, achieving high output force in a compact design, and addressing the poor linearity of actuator output at low frequencies. To address these issues, this paper presented an innovative electromagnetic-hydraulic-rubber integrated vibration isolator. Firstly, the study analyzed the dynamic characteristics of a two-degree-of-freedom isolation system and investigated the influence of active-passive hybrid vibration isolator parameters on control force and vibration reduction performance. Secondly, it was established that the magnetic circuit model and magnetic field strength expressions for the electromagnetic actuator using magnetic circuit analysis derive the analytical relationship between electromagnetic force, current amplitude, and frequency using the energy method. Subsequently, a mathematical model was developed for the rubber-hydraulic suspension component to examine its dynamic characteristics, hydraulic damping, and hydraulic force amplification transmission laws. Lastly, we organically combine the electromagnetic actuator with the rubber-hydraulic suspension and conduct a multi-physics joint simulation of the integrated vibration isolator using Comsol software to verify the effectiveness of the optimized design and vibration isolation control. Experimental research was carried out on the dynamic characteristics, output force properties, and fatigue characteristics of the integrated vibration isolator prototype. Results indicated that the established models and methods can achieve over 90% accuracy in predicting the performance of the electromagnetic actuator's output force and exhibit good linearity within the 5-400 Hz range. The rubber-hydraulic suspension can achieve an amplification factor of up to 1.5 for the electromagnetic force while reducing the transmission of vibrations to the base. The research findings can enhance the low-frequency vibration isolation performance of marine machinery equipment and improve their acoustic stealth capabilities.

AB The deep sea is often viewed as a vast, dark, remote, and inhospitable environment, yet the deep ocean and seafloor are crucial to our lives through the services that they provide. Our understanding of how the deep sea functions remains limited, but when treated synoptically, a diversity of supporting, provisioning, regulating and cultural services becomes apparent. The biological pump transports carbon from the atmosphere into deep-ocean water masses that are separated over prolonged periods, reducing the impact of anthropogenic carbon release. Microbial oxidation of methane keeps another potent greenhouse gas out of the atmosphere while trapping carbon in authigenic carbonates. Nutrient regeneration by all faunal size classes provides the elements necessary for fueling surface productivity and fisheries, and microbial processes detoxify a diversity of compounds. Each of these processes occur on a very small scale, yet considering the vast area over which they occur they become important for the global functioning of the ocean. The deep sea also provides a wealth of resources, including fish stocks, enormous bioprospecting potential, and elements and energy reserves that are currently being extracted and will be increasingly important in the near future. Society benefits from the intrigue and mystery, the strange life forms, and the great unknown that has acted as a muse for inspiration and imagination since near the beginning of civilization. While many functions occur on the scale of microns to meters and timescales up to years, the derived services that result are only useful after centuries of integrated activity. This vast dark habitat, which covers the majority of the globe, harbors processes that directly impact humans in a variety of ways; however, the same traits that differentiate it from terrestrial or shallow marine systems also result in a greater need for integrated spatial and temporal understanding as it experiences increased use by society. In this manuscript we aim to provide a foundation for informed conservation and management of the deep sea by summarizing the important role of the deep sea in society.

AB Ocean buoys play a critical role in marine hydrological, water quality, and meteorological monitoring, with applications in navigation, environmental observation, and communication. However, accurately modeling and deploying a multi-buoy system in the complex marine environment presents significant challenges. To address these challenges, this study proposes an enhanced deployment strategy using the tuna swarm optimizer enhanced with the fractional-order calculus method for marine observation. The proposed method first introduces a detailed observation model that precisely captures the performance of buoys in terms of coverage and communication efficiency. By integrating the observation coverage ratio and communication energy consumption, we establish an optimal multi-buoy deployment model. The proposed method leverages tent chaotic mapping to improve the diversity of initial solution generation and incorporates fractional-order calculus to strengthen its search capabilities. Simulation experiments and statistical analysis verify the effectiveness of the proposed deployment model, with the proposed method achieving the best performance in deploying the multi-buoy system, reaching a final fitness value of 0.190052 at iteration 449, outperforming TSA, PSO, GWO, and WOA. These results highlight the potential of the proposed method in optimizing multi-buoy system deployment in marine observation.

AB Offshore electricity production, mainly by wind turbines, and, eventually, floating PV, is expected to increase renewable energy generation and their dispatchability. In this sense, a significant part of this offshore electricity would be directly used for hydrogen generation. The integration of offshore energy production into the hydrogen economy is of paramount importance for both the techno-economic viability of offshore energy generation and the hydrogen economy. An analysis of this integration is presented. The analysis includes a discussion about the current state of the art of hydrogen pipelines and subsea cables, as well as the storage and bunkering system that is needed on shore to deliver hydrogen and derivatives. This analysis extends the scope of most of the previous works that consider port-to-port transport, while we report offshore to port. Such storage and bunkering will allow access to local and continental energy networks, as well as to integrate offshore facilities for the delivery of decarbonized fuel for the maritime sector. The results of such state of the art suggest that the main options for the transport of offshore energy for the production of hydrogen and hydrogenated vectors are through direct electricity transport by subsea cables to produce hydrogen onshore, or hydrogen transport by subsea pipeline. A parametric analysis of both alternatives, focused on cost estimates of each infrastructure (cable/pipeline) and shipping has been carried out versus the total amount of energy to transport and distance to shore. For low capacity (100 GWh/y), an electric subsea cable is the best option. For high-capacity renewable offshore plants (TWh/y), pipelines start to be competitive for distances above approx. 750 km. Cost is highly dependent on the distance to land, ranging from 35 to 200 USD/MWh.

AB Understanding and predicting biological stability and change in the face of rapid anthropogenic modifications of ecosystems and geosystems are grand challenges facing environmental and life scientists. Physiologically, organisms withstand environmental stress through changes in biochemical regulation that maintain homeostasis, which necessarily demands tradeoffs in the use of metabolic energy. Evolutionarily, in response to environmentally forced energetic tradeoffs, populations adapt based on standing genetic variation in the ability of individual organisms to reallocate metabolic energy. Combined study of physiology and genetics, separating "Nature and Nurture," is, thus, the key to understanding the potential for evolutionary adaptation to future global change. To understand biological responses to global change, we need experimentally tractable model species that have the well-developed physiological, genetic, and genomic resources necessary for partitioning variance in the allocation of metabolic energy into its causal components. Model species allow for discovery and for experimental manipulation of relevant phenotypic contrasts and enable a systems-biology approach that integrates multiple levels of analyses to map genotypic-to-phenotypic variation. Here, we illustrate how combined physiological and genetic studies that focus on energy metabolism in developmental stages of a model marine organism contribute to an understanding of the potential to adapt to environmental change. This integrative research program provides insights that can be readily incorporated into individual-based ecological models of population persistence under global change.

TI Sensitivity of a Red Sea numerical wave model to spatial and temporal

AB Simulating waves using numerical wave models provide essential wave information for navigational safety and coastal protection applications. Accuracy of such simulations depends mainly on the accuracy of the forcing wind fields, which are influenced by the wind fields' spatial and temporal resolutions. In this study, the sensitivity of a SWAN-based Red Sea wave model to spatial and temporal resolutions of forcing wind fields was investigated. The sensitivity analysis showed that forcing the wave model with wind fields of low spatial and/or temporal resolutions will affect the quality of wave model outputs, not only in terms of integrated wave parameters, but also in terms of the overall wave energy distribution in both frequency and directional domains. This study suggests that the spatial resolution of the forcing wind filed plays more significant role than the temporal resolution on the quality of the wave model predictions.

AB Surface current mapping high-frequency radars were installed along the northwest corner of Alaska during the open water periods of 2011-2013. A combination of wind and solar renewable energy inputs supplied electricity to single radar site operating at Point Barrow, Alaska, via an off-grid remote power module (RPM) The radar at Point Bar-row was able to simultaneously collect measurements of ocean surface currents, measure the position and velocity of passing vessels, and provide meteorological data in real time. This paper provides a summary of the performance of the power module from 2011 to 2013 and vessel detection results from 2013 with corresponding Automated Identification System (AIS) data. The RPM provided infrastructure to meteorological stations, high frequency radars and AIS in a resilient and robust manner and serves as an example of how the multi-use capability of integrated sensor modules can provide enhanced maritime domain awareness and persistent surveillance capabilities in remote Arctic environments.

AB A facile and scalable synthesis of mesoporous films impregnated with Au nanoparticles (NPs) as effective dielectrics is demonstrated for enhancing the nanogenerator performance based on vertical contact-separation mode. This technique is so simple and scalable, providing a promising solution for developing large-scale and practical self-powered devices. The spatial distribution of Au NPs made it possible to fabricate an Au NP-embedded mesoporous triboelectric nanogenerator (AMTENG) with a high output power of 13 mW under cycled compressive force, giving over 5-fold power enhancement, compared with a flat film-based TENG under the same mechanical force. It is proposed that the presence of aligned dipoles produced due to the charges created by the contact between Au NPs and PDMS inside the pores can influence the surface potential energy of mesoporous films. With such an enhanced power output and unique device design, we demonstrate various applications such as self-powered shape mapping sensors, foot-step driven large-scale AMTENGs, and integrated circuits with capacitors for powering commercial cell phones for realizing self-powered systems from footsteps, wind power, and ocean waves.

AB We present a new landscape-modelling framework based on a domain-specific language called Ocelet that is used to question our understanding of how mangrove forests cope with fast-changing muddy seashores. For the demonstration, we selected the coast of French Guiana where mangrove physiognomy and extent continuously vary due to successive and recurrent erosion or accretion phases resulting from the alongshore migration of mud banks originating from the Amazon River. We modelled the French Guiana coastal system as a set of ecological and physical processes involving entities (e.g. ocean, mangrove shoreline, mud bank) that are in relation with each other. Interaction functions are written to specify how the entities change when they interact, according to the level of understanding and knowledge available. The scenario then describes what interaction functions are activated at each time step. We applied the approach to explain mangrove shoreline variations from 1986 to 2009 over 45 kilometres, and examined the contribution of alongshore and cross-shore wave energy and current velocities. The model was run with daily ERA-Interim/ECMWF waves and Mercator-Ocean currents as input data, whereas a time series of remote sensing images was used during the initialization and validation phases. We then discuss the flexibility of our approach to integrate existing models of mangrove forest dynamics.

AB Frictional heating during earthquake rupture reveals important information on earthquake mechanisms and energy dissipation. The amount of annealing varies widely and is, as yet, poorly constrained. Here we use magnetic susceptibility versus temperature measurements during cycling to increasingly elevated temperatures to constrain the maximum temperature a slip zone has experienced. The case study comprises sheared clay cored from the Japan Trench subduction plate-boundary fault zone (d,collement), which accommodated the large slip of the 2011 M-w 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake. The d,collement was cored during the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 343, the Japan Trench Fast Drilling Project (JFAST). Heating signatures with estimated maximum temperatures ranging from similar to 300 to over 500 A degrees C are determined close to the multiple slip surfaces within the d,collement. Since it is impossible to tie a specific slip surface to a certain earthquake, thermal evidence for the cumulative effect of several earthquakes is unveiled. This as yet preliminary rock magnetic 'geothermometer' would be a useful tool to detect seismic heating along faults that experienced medium temperature rise, a range which is difficult to assess with other approaches.

AB Undersea optical communication (UOC) has been considered as the most potential next-generation underwater wireless communication technology for ocean exploration. Photodetector is the essential component in UOC system, however, the harsh undersea environment like light attenuation and seawater corrosivity restricts the applications of conventional photodetectors. Herein, a novel natural-electrolyte self-powered photoelectrochemical (PEC) photodetector based on core-shell structured Cu@GaN nanowires (NWs) network is demonstrated and direct utilization of seawater. High quality GaN shell is encapsulated on the Cu NWs network through Ga-coating and high temperature nitridation processes. A Schottky junction along radial direction has formed at the Cu/GaN interface due to the outward diffusion of Cu into the GaN layer. Such a structure provides narrowed band detection on blue light as well as efficient carrier separation. A self-powered undersea PEC photodetector is designed with a mini-pipes connected device chamber, which allows direct indrawing of seawater and blue channel light communication (458 nm). This photodetector works stably for UOC in both shallow and deep-sea conditions in Pacific Ocean area. It shows a high responsivity up to 5.04 mA W-1 and rapid response time of 0.68 ms. This photodetector can be easily integrated to marine equipment without waterproof packaging for the future energy-saving UOC.

AB Hydrodynamic modeling in cold climate regions necessitates more sophisticated approaches that accurately simulate ice-wave interactions. Traditional models often overlook the complex coupling mechanisms between ice and ocean waves, especially the two-way processes where ice attenuates wave energy and waves break ice floes. This oversight can also intensify modeling challenges in coastal areas, including large lakes, where ice-wave interactions influence storm surges, high waves, and coastal erosion. To address this gap, this paper introduces an enhanced modeling approach that integrates both ice-induced wave attenuation and wave- induced ice breakage. To implement these processes, the Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) is coupled with an unstructured-grid wave model (SWAN) and the unstructured-grid version of the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model (UG-CICE) to form the FVCOM-SWAVE-UG-CICE framework. Using this fully coupled model, simulations were conducted for the Great Lakes. Results of the modeled ice concentration, ice thickness, and significant wave heights were reported and validated against observational data from the U.S. National Ice Center (NIC) and in-situ under-ice measurements. To further study the coupling effects, results of the proposed model were also compared with those from no coupling and one-way coupling (focusing only on ice-induced wave attenuation) models. Comparative analyses demonstrated significant improvements in the predicted ice concentration with the proposed fully coupled model. These findings reveal the importance of incorporating ice-wave interactions inaccurately predicting ice cover dynamics in freshwater systems.

AB The productivity of a suspended mussel farm depends on the abundance of naturally available food. This study constructs a tracer decay model that incorporates mussel filtration and integrates it with a well-established 3D ocean circulation model to examine the spatiotemporal variation of seston depletion at a large-scale suspended mussel farm on Gouqi Island, located offshore in the East China Sea. A novel Wirewalker ocean-wave-powered vertical profiling system was deployed to monitor chlorophyll-a concentration at the edge of the mussel farm. The observed profiles of chlorophyll-a concentration revealed that the current exiting the farm during ebb tide is associated with a lower concentration compared to the current entering the farm during flood tide. This suggests that the filter feeding activity of mussels within the farm is primary contributor to this reduced chlorophyll-a concentration. This finding is consistent with the tracer model results, which indicates a higher tracer concentration entering the farm and a lower tracer concentration exiting it. The model results suggest that the blocking effect of the farm can significantly exacerbate seston depletion, particularly during neap tide as opposed to spring tide. The interplay of tidal characteristics and topography has resulted in two areas that are particularly vulnerable to seston depletion: one centrally situated within the mussel farm, and another near the islands. However, it is possible to alleviate seston depletion by aligning the waterway within the farm with the major axis of the tidal ellipse. Consequently, it is crucial to consider tidal conditions surrounding the farm for optimal farm layout design, increased production, and enhanced stock quality in shellfish farms facing seston depletion.

AB With the intensification of global ocean exploration, there is an increasing need for extensive and dispersed wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to meet the requirements of real-time, in-situ, and high-spatial-temporaldensity marine meteorological observations. Nevertheless, providing a reliable power source and ensuring the ongoing maintenance of these WSNs pose significant challenges. Here, an innovative self-powered wireless sensor node is developed to address these challenges, featuring an ultra-high-output triboelectric-electromagnetic hybrid generator (T-EHG) with a swinging mechanism. The T-EHG, which combines triboelectric (TENG) and electromagnetic (EMG) generation, assisted by a universal power management system (UPMS), efficiently converts wave energy into a consistent voltage output between 1.5 V to 3.3 V. Additionally, the self-powered WSNs integrated with T-EHG, UPMS circuits, meteorological sensors, and microcontroller units (MCUs) with LoRa wireless transmission functionality are capable of executing data collection and transmission operations every 10 s under simulated wave conditions. These systems can achieve a maximum wireless transmission range of 1.5 km. Notably, a marine meteorological monitoring system utilizes these autonomous sensor nodes, along with base stations, cloud servers, and terminal devices to effectively implement real-time, on-site measurements of temperature, humidity, and air pressure within the monitored zone. This research underscores the substantial practical utility and extensive application prospects of these advanced self-powered WSNs for marine meteorological surveillance.

TI Megha-Tropiques: mission planning, analysis, and operations
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
AB Climate in the tropics is primarily influenced by variations in energy and water budget exchanges in the land/ocean/atmosphere systems. The interaction of these systems with the general atmospheric circulation is still not fully understood -one of the reasons why weather forecasts and predictions of climatic events are less accurate. The Megha-Tropiques mission, an ISRO-CNES (Indian Space Research Organisation-Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales) collaborative programme, aims to study water cycle and energy exchanges in the tropics, and use the data in climate and meteorology models. Megha-Tropiques is part of the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission, which is an international network of satellites. Of the four payloads on board, MADRAS is jointly developed by ISRO and the French space agency, CNES; SAPHIR and SCARAB completely by CNES; and GPS-ROSA is obtained from TAS-I (Thales Alenia Space Italia, Milan, Italy). GPS-ROSA supplements the geophysical parameters of the other payloads for atmosphere modelling. Mission planning involved integrating and interrelating the efforts of space and ground systems in realizing the operational system that provides the satellite-based science data meeting the turnaround time (TAT). Prelaunch simulations involved usage of a software simulator as a tool for network tests, training of spacecraft operation personnel, and validating the spacecraft health-monitoring software. The required operations were performed to characterize the payloads as well as to calibrate the various attitude sensors of the spacecraft. This paper summarizes mission planning and analysis aiding spacecraft configuration, prelaunch mission simulations, launch and early-orbit operations, and the on-orbit operational guidelines for Megha-Tropiques.

ID TRIBOELECTRIC NANOGENERATOR
AB The self-powered internet of things (IoTs) is in high demand which eliminates batteries with limited lifetime and after-use environmental contaminations. Triboelectric nanogenerators can reveal environmental information through their charge transfer behavior, however, the signal pre-amplification is necessary consuming relatively high external energies and the sensing channels are greatly restricted by the limited information dimensions of the electrical outputs. Herein, we developed a fully-self-powered, natural-light-enabled sensing paradigm by integrating polymer network liquid crystals (PNLCs) triggered by rotary freestanding sliding TENGs (RFSTENGs), color filters and optical fibers, where the friction-modulated natural light instead of the tribo-charge serves as the information carrier without the necessity of pre-amplification of the tribo-charge signal. Compared with previous TENG enabled self-powered sensors, the developed paradigm significantly expands the dimensions of sensed information, enabling simultaneous monitoring of multiple environmental factors including irradiance, wind speed, and humidity. Through the wavelength divisions of the sunlight via color filters, the self-powered sensing can be performed in multiple channels. Experimental validation in an indoorsimulated oceanic atmospheric boundary layer demonstrates the independence of the sensing under different channels, and ultrahigh sensing accuracies of 98.3%, 97.3%, and 96.7% for irradiance, wind speed, and humidity monitoring, respectively.

AB Large-eddy simulations (LES) of the Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL) commonly utilize roughness length to parameterize wave effects on the sea surface. However, this method might not adequately capture the intricacies of wind-wave interactions, especially in swell-dominated conditions. In this study, we integrated a wave-induced stress parameterization method into the open-source LES code, PArallel Large-eddy simulation Model (PALM), and assessed its performance under low wind conditions with varying wave ages and directions. Our method treats windsea effects as surface friction while employing an exponentially decaying profile to represent swell-induced stress. We examined the model's sensitivity to wind and wave parameters and calibrated the wave damping rate values across various scenarios, leveraging data from wave-phase-resolved simulations and field measurements. The enhanced LES model with the proposed wave parameterization effectively reproduces wave-influenced wind characteristics such as upward momentum flux, low-level wind maximum, and negative wind gradients, showing good agreement with previous numerical and observational data. Moreover, our model accounts for wind-wave misalignment scenarios by calculating each directional and spectral wave stress component individually and integrating them over the wave spectrum. We found that the swell-induced stress is the dominant force in the wave boundary layer (WBL) with low wind speed, with its magnitude significantly varying with the wave direction relative to the wind. This variation influences the dynamic equilibrium within the WBL, modifying both wind shear and wind veer, and these effects persist up to the top of the boundary layer flow.
   Ocean waves significantly impact the atmospheric boundary layer flow by modulating the momentum and energy exchange at the wind-wave interface. Understanding these effects is crucial for an accurate modeling of the atmosphere and ocean systems. We incorporated the wave-induced stress into the conventional logarithmic wind profile near the sea surface to improve the presentation of the wind-wave interaction in the numerical simulation. The enhanced model can reproduce complex processes such as the wind-wave misalignment effects, energy transfer from wave to wind field, and wave-induced jet flows. Our findings show that the wave stress is the dominant force in the wave boundary layer and its influence on wind varies with their direction relative to the wind. Swells that follow the wind reduce friction and accelerate wind speed, while opposing swells increase drag, potentially causing slower or even reversed near-surface winds. These wave impacts can extend to the top of the atmospheric boundary layer through turbulent mixing. Incorporating wave-induced stress into large-eddy simulations significantly enhances the representation of offshore wind fields and contributes to research on atmosphere-ocean interactions and offshore meteorology.
   Parameterization of wave-induced stress is integrated into a large-eddy simulation model and verified for the first time The wave growth/damping rate for the proposed parameterization is calibrated by comparison with numerical and observational data Wind-wave misalignment impacts the wind and turbulence by modifying the dynamic equilibrium in the wave boundary layer

AB The ENDURUNS project is a European Research project of the Horizon 2020 framework, which has as its main objective to achieve the optimum and intelligent use of green hydrogen energy for long-term ocean surveys. The ENDURUNS system comprises an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) and an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) with gliding capability. The power pack of the USV integrates Li-ion batteries with photovoltaic panels, whilst the AUV employs Li-ion batteries and a hydrogen fuel cell. It is essential to develop a continuous monitoring ca-pability for the different systems of the vehicles. Data transmission between the devices onboard presents challenges due to the volume and structure of the different datasets. A telecommunications network has been designed to manage the operational components considered in the project. The autonomous vehicles perform measurements, providing their position and other data wirelessly. The system will generate a great volume of various signals during the survey. The Remote Control Centre needs to be interfaced with the vehicles in order to receive, manage and store the acquired data. An Underwater Internet of Things (IoT) platform is designed to establish efficient and smart data management. This study presents an exhaustive survey to analyse the telecommunication systems employed in the autonomous vehicles, including the back-end, user interface and mobile units. This paper presents the novel design of the hardware and software structure of the ENDURUNS project with regard to the literature, where its components and their in-terconnection layers are detailed, which is a novel scientific and technological approach for autonomous seabed surveying in deep oceans or in coastal areas.

TI Porting the WAVEWATCH III (v6.07) wave action source terms to GPU
SO GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT

ID EARTH SYSTEM MODEL; HINDCAST; IMPACTS
AB Surface gravity waves play a critical role in several processes, including mixing, coastal inundation, and surface fluxes. Despite the growing literature on the importance of ocean surface waves, wind-wave processes have traditionally been excluded from Earth system models (ESMs) due to the high computational costs of running spectral wave models. The development of the Next Generation Ocean Model for the DOE's (Department of Energy) E3SM (Energy Exascale Earth System Model) Project partly focuses on the inclusion of a wave model, WAVEWATCH III (WW3), into E3SM. WW3, which was originally developed for operational wave forecasting, needs to be computationally less expensive before it can be integrated into ESMs. To accomplish this, we take advantage of heterogeneous architectures at DOE leadership computing facilities and the increasing computing power of general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs). This paper identifies the wave action source terms, W3SRCEMD, as the most computationally intensive module in WW3 and then accelerates them via GPU. Our experiments on two computing platforms, Kodiak (P100 GPU and Intel(R) Xeon(R) central processing unit, CPU, E5-2695 v4) and Summit (V100 GPU and IBM POWER9 CPU) show respective average speedups of 2x and 4x when mapping one Message Passing Interface (MPI) per GPU. An average speedup of 1.4x was achieved using all 42 CPU cores and 6 GPUs on a Summit node (with 7 MPI ranks per GPU). However, the GPU speedup over the 42 CPU cores remains relatively unchanged (similar to 1.3x) even when using 4 MPI ranks per GPU (24 ranks in total) and 3 MPI ranks per GPU (18 ranks in total). This corresponds to a 35 %-40 % decrease in both simulation time and usage of resources. Due to too many local scalars and arrays in the W3SRCEMD subroutine and the huge WW3 memory requirement, GPU performance is currently limited by the data transfer bandwidth between the CPU and the GPU. Ideally, OpenACC routine directives could be used to further improve performance. However, W3SRCEMD would require significant code refactoring to make this possible. We also discuss how the trade-off between the occupancy, register, and latency affects the GPU performance of WW3.

AB The dynamic complexity of the sea surface, characterized by the simultaneous presence of multiple wave systems, necessitates a detailed analysis beyond the scope of traditional integrated bulk wave parameters, which, in the case of multimodal seas, can provide inaccurate information. This research leverages spectral techniques to identify wave system populations - referred to as wave families - in order to investigate wave climatology along the U.S. East and Gulf coasts. Utilizing in-situ directional spectral buoy measurements from NOAA's National Data Buoy Center, the frequency-direction wave spectra are constructed using the maximum entropy method. The wave spectra are then partitioned into wave systems using the watershed algorithm, enabling the generation of the occurrence distribution of the spectral partitions' peak energy density. The occurrence distribution at each buoy location is further partitioned to identify predominant wave families, each one with unique meteorological and geographical origins. Our analysis presents notable spatiotemporal variability in wave family characteristics, such as wave family significant wave height, wave period, and directional range, across different buoy locations and seasons, thus accentuating the complexity of wind-generated waves and their potential implications on coastal dynamics.

AB In oceanic and atmospheric flows, the eddy vorticity flux divergence-denoted "F'' herein-emerges as a key dynamical quantity, capturing the average effect of fluctuations on the time-mean circulation. For a barotropic system, F is derived from the horizontal velocity covariance matrix, which itself can be represented geometrically in terms of the so-called variance ellipse. This study proves that F may be decomposed into two different components, with distinct geometric interpretations. The first arises from variations in variance ellipse orientation, and the second arises from variations in the kinetic energy of the anisotropic part of the velocity fluctuations, which can be seen as a function of variance ellipse size and shape. Application of the divergence theorem shows that F integrated over a closed region is explained entirely by separate variations in these two quantities around the region periphery. A further decomposition into four terms shows that only four specific spatial patterns of ellipse variability can give rise to a nonzero eddy vorticity flux divergence. The geometric decomposition offers a new tool for the study of eddy-mean flow interactions, as is illustrated with application to an unstable eastward jet on a beta plane.

AB Mercury (Hg2+) and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) are ubiquitous and persistent pollutants with multiple toxicities in bivalve molluscs. Here, the toxicological responses in the gills of Manila clams, Ruditapes philippinarum, to Hg2+ (10 mu g L-1), BaP (3 mu g L-1),and their mixture were analysed using transcriptomics and metabolomics approaches. Comparisons of the transcriptomes and metabolomes of Hg2+- and/or BaP-treated clams with control animals revealed the involvement of the detoxification metabolism, immune defence, energy-related pathways, and osmotic regulation in the stress response of R. philippinarum. Exposure to Hg2+ alone primarily enhanced the detoxification and energy metabolic pathways by significantly increasing the expression of genes associated with heat-shock proteins and oxidative phosphorylation. However, co-exposure to Hg2+ and BaP caused greater immunotoxicity and disrupted detoxification metabolism, the TCA cycle, glycolysis, and ATP generation. The expression levels of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), and myosin (MYO), and the activity of electron transport system (ETS) in gills were detected, supporting the underlying toxic mechanisms of Hg2+ and BaP. We suggest that the presence of BaP enhances the toxicity of Hg2+ by 1) hampering the detoxification of Hg2+, 2) increasing the immunotoxicity of Hg2+, and 3) constraining energy availability for clams.

AB The vast energy stored in the ocean, which receives an average solar power of approximate to 60 000 TW per year, surpasses human energy consumption by three orders of magnitude. Harnessing even a small fraction of it holds great promise in addressing global energy and water crises. Here, an integrated device that achieves unprecedented power density up to 1.1 W m-2 with excellent stability through a salinity concentration gradient induced by solar evaporation, while simultaneously producing clean water at a rate of 1.25 kg m-2 h-1 under one sun irradiation is presented. The remarkable electricity generation capability stems from the unique interlayer structure of polyaniline-graphene oxide-MnO2 (PANI@GO/MnO2) electrodes, enabling the recovery of electrochemical potentials from a wide range of ion salinity concentrations within the device and the additional Donnan potential generated by the anion-exchange membrane. Furthermore, periodic flipping of the device effectively reactivates the electrodes and suppresses salt accumulation, enabling long-term operation. Notably, a prototype device of 8 x 25 cm2 exhibits a short-circuit current of 10 mA and an open-circuit voltage of 10.2 V, as well as a clean water production rate of 24.8 g per hour. These findings shed light on the reliable technology for power and freshwater supply in marine environments.

AB The Western Pacific sees more tropical typhoons and storms annually as compared to other ocean basins. The destructive typhoons caused economic and infrastructure damage and have left many devastated communities. The use of solar photovoltaic power is also increasing, and in the event of extended power cuts, it can provide power to the affected communities, particularly during the response and recovery periods. However, solar installations are also vulnerable to typhoon-force winds and can suffer extensive damages. Currently, limited work has been conducted on approaches that optimise solar panels installation in low-rise residential buildings in terms of structural and energy performance. A solution that can reduce solar installation damage and frequency is necessary, especially for developing countries. A framework based on fluid-structure interaction (FSI) modelling and building energy simulation (BES) was proposed to evaluate roof-mounted solar panels' structural and energy performance. The FSI simulation was carried out for a typical low-rise building design with solar panels subjected to typhoon-strength approach winds. Different configurations were simulated in BES to predict the building energy demand and optimise the solar photovoltaic energy generation. Based on the evaluated configurations and conditions, it was observed that the panels failed on the roof's leeward side, and maximum destruction occurs at 45 degrees wind direction. A balance between structural resilience and energy generation was observed for the building with a roof pitch of 37 degrees, sustaining the occupant's energy requirements even in the face of typhoons and other extreme storms. The framework proposed in this study can support decision-makers and stakeholders in planning and designing typhoon resilient solar PV rooftop installations.

AB Solar irradiation (Rs) is the electromagnetic radiation energy emitted by the Sun. It plays a crucial role in sustaining life on Earth by providing light, heat, and energy. Furthermore, it serves as a key driver of Earth's climate and weather systems, influencing the distribution of heat across the planet, shaping global air and ocean currents, and determining weather patterns. Variations in Rs levels have significant implications for climate change and long-term climate trends. Moreover, Rs represents an abundant and renewable energy resource, offering a clean and sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. By harnessing solar energy, we can actively reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the utilization of Rs comes with its own challenges that must be addressed. One problem is its variability, which makes it difficult to predict and plan for consistent solar energy generation. Its intermittent nature also poses difficulties in meeting continuous energy demand unless appropriate energy storage or backup systems are in place. Integrating large-scale solar energy systems into existing power grids can present technical challenges. Rs levels are influenced by various factors; understanding these factors is crucial for various applications, such as renewable energy planning, climate modeling, and environmental studies. Overcoming the associated challenges requires advancements in technology and innovative solutions. Measuring and harnessing Rs for various applications can be achieved using various devices; however, the expense and scarcity of measuring equipment pose challenges in accurately assessing and monitoring Rs levels. In order to address this, alternative methods have been developed with which to estimate Rs, including artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) models, like neural networks, kernel algorithms, tree-based models, and ensemble methods. To demonstrate the impact of feature selection methods on Rs predictions, we propose a Multivariate Time Series (MVTS) model using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with a decision tree (DT), Pearson correlation (Pr), logistic regression (LR), Gradient Boosting Models (GBM), and a random forest (RF). Our article introduces a novel framework that integrates various models and incorporates overlooked factors. This framework offers a more comprehensive understanding of Recursive Feature Elimination and its integrations with different models in multivariate solar radiation forecasting. Our research delves into unexplored aspects and challenges existing theories related to solar radiation forecasting. Our results show reliable predictions based on essential criteria. The feature ranking may vary depending on the model used, with the RF Regressor algorithm selecting features such as maximum temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and relative humidity for specific months. The DT algorithm may yield a slightly different set of selected features. Despite the variations, all of the models exhibit impressive performance, with the LR model demonstrating outstanding performance with low RMSE (0.003) and the highest R2 score (0.002). The other models also show promising results, with RMSE scores ranging from 0.006 to 0.007 and a consistent R2 score of 0.999.

ID PREDICTION
AB Accurate forecasting of significant wave heights (SWH) plays an important role in the generation and conversion of ocean wave energy, being a promising clean energy source, while a challenging task since the SWH is produced by a complex natural process. Additionally, some deep forecasting models integrate parallel and recursive structures via unexplained ways to present intelligent fitting, leading to insufficient inheritance of hybrid advantages. Since biological multisensory systems automatically cope with complex time series, this paper explores a bio-multisensory-inspired gate-attention coordination network (BGC-Net) for forecasting SWH. Specifically, inspired by the multisensory cognitive process, the BGC-Net includes sensory capture, brain memory, and forecasting components, and their collaboration offers a clear multi-level handling process. In internal implementations, through mimicking that multiple senses independently capture external stimuli, the first component adopts several activation functions for suppressing data fluctuations and detecting the complex nonlinear and linear features. Through mimicking that the left and right hemispheres interact and collaborate electrical impulses, the second component integrates both gate-driven recursive and self-attention-driven parallel structures to extract multivariate and temporal dependencies at the feature level. Through mimicking that a higher cerebral cortex fuses extracted information for the final cognition, the third component proposes three feature fusion ways of concatenate, attention, and gated fusion, and takes the best one to generate SWH forecasts. In summary, the BGC-Net not only has interpretability at the biological level but also effectively integrates the advantages of parallel and recursive structures. Five experiments and six analyses all indicate that the BGC-Net exceeds 17 baselines, has root mean squared error (RMSE) average improvements with 22.30% and 19.22% for two datasets, and provides references to support SWH forecasting.

AB Robust prediction of population responses to changing environments requires the integration of factors controlling population dynamics with processes affecting distribution. This is true everywhere but especially in polar pelagic environments. Biological cycles for many polar species are synchronised to extreme seasonality, while their distributions may be influenced by both the prevailing oceanic circulation and sea-ice distribution. Antarctic krill (krill, Euphausia superba) is one such species exhibiting a complex life history that is finely tuned to the extreme seasonality of the Southern Ocean. Dependencies on the timing of optimal seasonal conditions have led to concerns over the effects of future climate on krill's population status, particularly given the species' important role within Southern Ocean ecosystems. Under a changing climate, established correlations between environment and species may breakdown. Developing the capacity for predicting krill responses to climate change therefore requires methods that can explicitly consider the interplay between life history, biological conditions, and transport. The Spatial Ecosystem And Population Dynamics Model (SEAPODYM) is one such framework that integrates population and general circulation modelling to simulate the spatial dynamics of key organisms. Here, we describe a modification to SEAPODYM, creating a novel model - KRILLPODYM - that generates spatially resolved estimates of krill biomass and demographics. This new model consists of three major components: (1) an age-structured population consisting of five key life stages, each with multiple age classes, which undergo age-dependent growth and mortality, (2) six key habitats that mediate the production of larvae and life stage survival, and (3) spatial dynamics driven by both the underlying circulation of ocean currents and advection of sea-ice. We present the first results of KRILLPODYM, using published deterministic functions of population processes and habitat suitability rules. Initialising from a non-informative uniform density across the Southern Ocean our model independently develops a circumpolar population distribution of krill that approximates observations. The model framework lends itself to applied experiments aimed at resolving key population parameters, life-stage specific habitat requirements, and dominant transport regimes, ultimately informing sustainable fishery management.

AB El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the leading mode of global interannual variability, usually intensifies the Hadley Circulation (HC), and meanwhile constrains its meridional extension, leading to an equatorward movement of the jet system. Previous studies have investigated the response of HC to ENSO events using different reanalysis datasets and evaluated their capability in capturing the main features of ENSO-associated HC anomalies. However, these studies mainly focused on the global HC, represented by a zonal-mean mass stream function (MSF). Comparatively fewer studies have evaluated HC responses from a regional perspective, partly due to the prerequisite of the Stokes MSF, which prevents us from integrating a regional HC. In this study, we adopt a recently developed technique to construct the three-dimensional structure of HC and evaluate the capability of eight state-of-the-art reanalyses in reproducing the regional HC response to ENSO events. Results show that all eight reanalyses reproduce the spatial structure of HC responses well, with an intensified HC around the central-eastern Pacific but weakened circulations around the Indo-Pacific warm pool and tropical Atlantic. The spatial correlation coefficient of the three-dimensional HC anomalies among the different datasets is always larger than 0.93. However, these datasets may not capture the amplitudes of the HC responses well. This uncertainty is especially large for ENSO-associated equatorially asymmetric HC anomalies, with the maximum amplitude in Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) being about 2.7 times the minimum value in the Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR). One should be careful when using reanalysis data to evaluate the intensity of ENSO-associated HC anomalies.

AB The East Australian Current (EAC) is the complex and highly energetic poleward western boundary current of the South Pacific Ocean. A full-depth current meter and property (temperature and salinity) mooring array was deployed from the continental shelf to the abyssal waters off Brisbane Australia (27 degrees S) for 18 months from April 2012 to August 2013. The EAC mooring array is an essential component of the Australian Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS). During this period the EAC was coherent with an eddy kinetic to mean kinetic energy ratio of less than 1. The 18-month, mean, poleward-only mass transport above 2000 m is 22.1 +/- 7.5 Sverdrups (Sv; 1 Sv equivalent to 10(6) m(3) s(-1)). The mean, poleward-only heat transport and flow-weighted temperature above 2000 m are -1.35 +/- 0.42 PW and 15.33 degrees C, respectively. A difference in the poleward-only and net poleward mass and heat transports above 2000 m of 6.3 Sv and 0.24 PW reflects the presence of an equatorward EAC retroflection at the eastern (offshore) end of the mooring array. A complex empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of the along-slope velocity anomalies finds that the first two modes explain 72.1% of the velocity variance. Mode 1 is dominant at periods of approximately 60 days, and mode 2 is dominant at periods of 120 days. These dominant periods agree with previous studies in the Tasman Sea south of 27 degrees S and suggest that variability of the EAC in the Tasman Sea may be linked to variability north of 27 degrees S.

AB In the latest geophysical survey crossing the Ninety East Ridge of the Indian Ocean, a new method was employed to perform proportional double seismic source excitation and synchronously receive signals from the sea surface and the seabed. The two seismic sources used for excitation were two sets of gun arrays with different energies and dominant frequencies, a G gun array and a Bolt gun array. The G gun array consisted of 3 G.II guns with a total capacity of 450 in(3) and a dominant frequency of 20-100 Hz. The Bolt gun array consisted of 4 Bolt 1500LL air guns with a total capacity of 6000 in(3) and a dominant frequency of 10-40 Hz. The seismic receiving system comprised a 480-channel seismic streamer towed from the sea surface and 21 ocean bottom seismometers (OBS). During offshore operations, the integrated navigation system produced equidistant trigger signals at an interval of 50 m. The trigger signals were distributed to the G gun array and Bolt gun array at a ratio of 3:1 after passing through a pulse signal proportional distributor. The two sets of gun arrays fired alternatingly at a given ratio. The receiving equipment on the sea surface and seabed simultaneously received the seismic signals excited by the two sets of gun arrays. After targeted data processing, in addition to the seismic profile generated by the conventional G gun seismic source, the deep seismic profile generated by the Bolt gun seismic source and the survey profile of the active-source OBS were obtained simultaneously. The penetration depths of the three sets of profiles reach 2 km, 6 km, and 30 km, respectively, greatly improving the efficiency of offshore deep-sea seismic surveys.

AB Multi-purpose offshore structures are very complex systems to be designed as many different requirements have to be taken into account simultaneously. Experimental tests on scaled models can be very useful to verify structural behavior and to validate numerical models. The definition of the scale can play a key role in performing tests as high scales, closer to full-scale, are generally related to more reliable results. The present paper concerns the design of a wind turbine model for a large-scale model of a Multi-purpose offshore Platform developed within the EU project H2020 Blue Growth Farm. This project aims at developing an offshore farm, based on a modular floating structure that integrates wave energy converters and a wind turbine with aquaculture. The scale model of the complete structure will be deployed at the Natural Ocean Engineering Laboratory (NOEL). The paper will focus on the strategies adopted to scale 1:15 the DTU 10 MW wind turbine in order to represent both the main aeroelastic features and all the functionalities of a real machine. The complete design of the machine and its control will be also provided.

AB In this study, an attempt is made to analyze the sensitivity of land surface process and the associated moisture budget characteristics of the cyclonic storm Yemyin (2007), which originated over the Bay of Bengal, crossed the entire Indian subcontinent, entered into the Arabian Sea and made a 2nd landfall at the Pakistan Coast. Sensitivity of land surface processes is carried using the WRF-ARW model with a focus on the sustainability and re-intensification of the system over land along with the available observations. Our results suggest that the transport of moisture and soil moisture played a major role in the maintenance and re-intensification of the system over land. Transport of the strong moisture by the monsoon currents from the Arabian Sea to land furnished the energy required for the system. The transport of the vertically integrated moisture helped to increase the moisture convergence over the Indian landmass which gave the energy to sustain the system on land. An early period of rainfall before reaching the system helped to increase the soil moisture which releases the latent heat over land. Evaporation over land played an important role in amplifying the mid-tropospheric moisture, which contributed to the precipitation along with moisture flux convergence. The Noah and RUC land surface physics produced the least errors in the movement of the system while the RUC scheme gives significant results for intensification. The soil moisture zero experiment failed to provide the good results for movement and intensity of the system compared to other experiments. The soil moisture zero experiment did not yield give good results due to lack of sufficient soil moisture.

AB The effects of atmospheric thermal structure on the surface energy flux are poorly understood over the Arctic sea-ice surface. Here, we explore the mechanism of sensible heat exchange under different types of thermal structures over the Arctic sea-ice surface by using data collected during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate expedition. The quadrant analysis indicates that strong surface temperature inversions below 100 m enhance non-local effects on the positive (upward) sensible heat flux ((w'theta') over bar) through entrainment of large eddies from the convective boundary layer aloft. However, strong surface inversions restrict the contributions of large eddies to the negative (downward) (w'theta') over bar due to intensified surface stability. By inspecting the existing parameterization schemes, we found that the European Center for MediumRange Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecasting System scheme fails to predict the impacts of non-local processes on the positive (w'theta') over bar, and an adjustment term to correct the bias of parameterized (w'theta') over bar is proposed.
   Plain Language Summary Since pre-industrial times, the increase of Arctic near-surface air temperature has been 2-3 times larger than the global average, known as the Arctic amplification. The atmospheric physical processes occurring in the boundary layer are essential for understanding the ongoing climate changes because they modulate the surface energy budget over the Arctic. However, scarce observations limit our understanding of surface heat flux exchange in this area. Recently, the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition was conducted in the central Arctic to support the urgent need for understanding and modeling the rapidly changing Arctic atmosphere-ice-ocean system. Based on the MOSAiC observations, we investigate the role of non-local effects on sensible heat flux under different types of atmospheric thermal structures over the Arctic sea-ice surface. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first time that the effects of strong surface inversions on negative and positive sensible heat fluxes over the Arctic sea-ice surface are found to be opposite. In addition, we propose a method for taking non-local effects into account, which can be applied in the European Center for MediumRange Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecasting System flux parameterization or other numerical models to correct the bias in parameterized positive sensible heat flux.

AB As an extension and novel category of the Internet of Things (IoT), the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) attracts growing interest in sensing and exploiting ocean. Underwater Sensor Networks (UWSNs) are the existing application to support the concept of IoUT but faced with many challenges in information acquisition as well. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) assisted hierarchical information acquisition system composed of a marine stationary sensor layer and an AUV motion layer. Different from the most existing data-gathering schemes that ignored the energy management of underwater sensor nodes and the angle control in AUV operation, this work designs an energy-aware clustering protocol based on the improved K-Means algorithm (ECBIK) to achieve energy efficiency of sensor nodes and proposes a novel Ant Colony (ACO) algorithm integrating with Markov Reward Process (R-ACO) to optimize the distance and angle in AUV path planning. Specifically, in the sensor layer, we first calculate the accurate number of clusters according to the Elbow method, and then introduce a cluster head dynamic conversion mechanism by considering energy load and node survival rate. In the AUV motion layer, we establish a reliable AUV trajectory model to quantify the angle change during its operation. Meanwhile, we apply far-sighted feature of MRP to path optimization. Finally, simulation results validate the performance of our designed algorithms. Compared with the traditional clustering methods of K-Means and LEACH-L, the node survival rates of the proposed ECBIK are increased by 26% and 129.1% respectively. And in the aspect of path planning, the distance and angle under R-ACO are reduced by 4% and 18% respectively compared with ACO.

AB Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations predict that CaSiO3 perovskite melts at 5600 K at 136 GPa, and 6400 K at 300 GPa, significantly higher than MgSiO3 perovskite. The entropy of melting (1.8 k(B) per atom) is much larger than that of many silicates at ambient pressure and of simple liquids and varies little with pressure. The volume of melting decreases rapidly with increasing pressure, to 3 % at 136 GPa, producing a melting slope that diminishes rapidly with pressure. We determine the melting temperature via the ZW method, combining the Z method, for which we clarify the theoretical basis, with a waiting time analysis. The ZW method results are internally confirmed by integrating the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which also yields our results for the entropy and volume of melting. We find the eutectic composition on the MgSiO3-CaSiO3 join to be x(Ca) = 0.26 at 136 GPa and that metasilicate melt is denser than coexisting silicates.

AB In this study, the newly developed (2 + 1)-dimensional Davey-Stewartson system, characterized by parabolic law nonlinearity, is examined. This equation is recognized as significant for modeling surface wave patterns in finite-depth conditions. The model is initially transformed into lower dimensions using the wave transformation. Various soliton solutions, including kink, anti-kink, periodic, and chirped solitons, are derived using the generalized logistic equation method. These soliton structures have practical applications in fields such as optical pulse propagation in fiber optics, signal transmission in communication systems, energy transport in ocean engineering, and biological wave modeling, particularly in understanding nonlinear wave dynamics in shallow water and geophysical flows. To deepen our understanding of the physics behind these solutions, they are visualized using various representations, including 3D plots, 2D plots, density plots, and polar plots. Following this, a phase portrait analysis is conducted on the critical points of the unperturbed dynamical system. Subsequently, an outward force is introduced, and the perturbed system's behavior is examined using advanced chaos detection techniques. These include Poincar & eacute; maps, time series graphs, multistability analysis, chaotic attractors, return maps, power spectra, and Lyapunov exponents. A newly introduced bidirectional scatter plot approach is employed to perform a comparative analysis of solution behaviors, effectively highlighting overlapping regions and distinctions within their solution spaces through data points. This study contributes to the understanding of nonlinear wave systems and provides new tools for future research in applied mathematics.

AB Seismic slip zones convey important information on earthquake energy dissipation and rupture processes. However, geological records of earthquakes along exhumed faults remain scarce. They can be traced with a variety of methods that establish the frictional heating of seismic slip, although each has certain assets and disadvantages. Here we describe a mineral magnetic method to identify seismic slip along with its peak temperature through examination of magnetic mineral assemblages within a fault zone in deep-sea sediments cored from the Japan Trenchone of the seismically most active regions around Japanduring the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 343, the Japan Trench Fast Drilling Project. Fault zone sediments and adjacent host sediments were analyzed mineral magnetically, supplemented by scanning electron microscope observations with associated energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses. The presence of the magnetic mineral pyrrhotite appears to be restricted to three fault zones occurring at similar to 697, similar to 720, and similar to 801m below sea floor in the frontal prism sediments, while it is absent in the adjacent host sediments. Elevated temperatures and coseismic hot fluids as a consequence of frictional heating during earthquake rupture induced partial reaction of preexisting pyrite to pyrrhotite. The presence of pyrrhotite in combination with pyrite-to-pyrrhotite reaction kinetics constrains the peak temperature to between 640 and 800 degrees C. The integrated mineral-magnetic, microscopic, and kinetic approach adopted here is a useful tool to identify seismic slip along faults without frictional melt and establish the associated maximum temperature.

AB Ice-covered waterbodies are far from being quiescent systems. In this paper, we investigate ice-covered freshwater basins heated by solar radiation that penetrates across waters with temperatures below or near the temperature of maximum density. In this scenario, solar radiation sets a radiative buoyancy flux, Phi(r), that forces increments of temperature/density in the upper fluid volume, which can become gravitationally unstable and drive convection. The goal of this study is twofold. We first focus on formulating the mechanical energy budget, putting emphasis on the conversion of Phi(r) to available potential energy, E-a. We find that E-a results from a competition among Phi(r) and the irreversible mixing controlled by the diapycnal and the laminar mixing rates, respectively. Secondly, and based on the above result, we introduce an integral formulation of the mixing efficiency to quantify the rate of mixing over the relevant time scale tau, eta(c) = Delta E-b,E-tau/E-r,E-tau where Delta E-b,E-tau and E-r,E-tau are the change of background potential energy and the time-integrated Phi(r) over r. The above definition is applied to estimate eta(c) for the first time, finding an approximate value of eta(c) approximate to 0.65. This result suggests that radiatively heated ice-covered waterbodies might be subject to high mixing rates. Overall, the present work provides a framework to examine energetics and mixing in ice-covered waters.

AB Due to the rapid growth in global plastic production, in short-term applications, and negative impacts on natural ecosystems, plastics have received much attention. Additionally, the entire plastic value chain generates a significant amount of GHGs, and plastic use reductions should be considered as interventions addressing the climate crisis. This work investigates the life cycle of plastics in non-durable goods holistically. It identifies interventions to improve the sustainability and circularity of the system of production and analyzes the potential benefit of these interventions as climate change solutions. A baseline global market for plastics is defined and forecast to 2050, to which four interventions are applied: (1) plastic reduction through elimination and reuse; (2) replacement with paper; (3) replacement with recycled feedstock, (4) replacement with bioplastics. The highest potential in GHG emissions reduction lies in plastic reduction, followed by replacement with recycled plastics, paper, and, finally, bioplastics. Together the integrated system can reduce between 9.5 and 14.9 Gt CO2-eq from 2020 to 2050. The environmental and social impact of applying all these interventions in parallel is significant, as plastics are at the intersection of many challenges, including waste production, energy use, ocean pollution, and land disruption from fossil extraction.

AB Inland waters receive a significant quantity of carbon (C) from land. The fate of this C during transit, whether it is emitted to the atmosphere, accumulated in sediments or transported to the ocean, can considerably reshape the landscape C balance. However, these different fates of terrestrial C are not independent but are instead linked via several catchment and aquatic processes. Thus, according to mass conservation, any environmental change inducing a shift in a particular C fate should come at the expense of at least one other fate. Nonetheless, studies that have investigated C emission, accumulation and transport concertedly are scarce, resulting in fragmented knowledge of the role of inland waters in the global C cycle. Here, we propose a framework to understand how different C fates in aquatic systems are interlinked and covary under environmental changes. First, to explore how C fates are currently distributed in streams, rivers, reservoirs and lakes, we compiled data from the literature and show that 'C fate allocation' varies widely both within and among inland water systems types. Secondly, we developed a framework that integrates C fates in any inland water system by identifying the key processes underlying their linkages. Our framework places the partitioning between the different C forms, and how this is controlled by export from land, internal transformations and hydrology, as central to understanding C fate allocation. We argue that, by focusing on a single fate, studies could risk drawing misleading conclusions regarding how environmental changes will alter the role of inland waters in the global C cycle. Our framework thus allows us to holistically assess the consequences of such changes on coupled C fluxes, setting a foundation for understanding the contemporary and future fate of land-derived C in inland water systems.

AB The rapid development of offshore wind farms (OWFs) has raised concerns about the increasing conflicts and synergies with existing marine activities, especially the traditional fishery industry, from socioeconomic and environmental perspectives. Quantifying the conflicts and synergies require frameworks that can consider environment and economic systems simultaneously. This study builds on and extends a well-established computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to incorporate a natural capital and ecosystem service into the modelling framework, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the two-way interactions between the economy and natural environment. Our results suggest that expansion of OWFs has significant negative impacts on the seafood sectors, whereas fish stocks benefit slightly as fewer fish are harvested. Moreover, the increase in fish stocks due to the closed areas and artificial reef effect could bring benefits to the fishing sector, and pass onto the wider economy. The combined impacts of expansion of OWFs and increased fish stock demonstrate the potential benefits of multi-use of marine spaces by the OWFs and fishing activities. This modelling approach provides an illustration of the potential and importance of incorporating natural capital into CGE models in practice, which could be used for policy making regarding marine renewable energy and sustainable development planning in the marine environment.

AB The sixth generation (6G) wireless communication aims to enable ubiquitous intelligent connectivity in future space-air-ground-ocean-integrated networks, with extremely low latency and enhanced global coverage. However, the explosive growth in Internet of Things devices poses new challenges for smart devices to process the generated tremendous data with limited resources. In 6G networks, conventional mobile edge computing (MEC) systems encounter serious problems to satisfy the requirements of ubiquitous computing and intelligence, with extremely high mobility, resource limitation, and time variability. In this article, we propose the model of wireless computing power networks (WCPNs), by jointly unifying the computing resources from both end devices and MEC servers. Furthermore, we formulate the new problem of task transfer, to optimize the allocation of computation and communication resources in WCPN. The main objective of task transfer is to minimize the execution latency and energy consumption with respect to resource limitations and task requirements. To solve the formulated problem, we propose a multiagent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to find the optimal task transfer and resource allocation strategies. The DRL agents collaborate with others to train a global strategy model through the proposed asynchronous federated aggregation scheme. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme can improve computation efficiency, speed up convergence rate, and enhance utility performance.

AB Satellite based top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and surface radiation budget observations are combined with mass corrected vertically integrated atmospheric energy divergence and tendency from reanalysis to infer the regional distribution of the TOA, atmospheric and surface energy budget terms over the globe. Hemispheric contrasts in the energy budget terms are used to determine the radiative and combined sensible and latent heat contributions to the cross-equatorial heat transports in the atmosphere (AHT(EQ)) and ocean (OHTEQ). The contrast in net atmospheric radiation implies an AHT(EQ) from the northern hemisphere (NH) to the southern hemisphere (SH) (0.75 PW), while the hemispheric difference in sensible and latent heat implies an AHT(EQ) in the opposite direction (0.51 PW), resulting in a net NH to SH AHT(EQ) (0.24 PW). At the surface, the hemispheric contrast in the radiative component (0.95 PW) dominates, implying a 0.44 PW SH to NH OHTEQ. Coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 (CMIP5) models with excessive net downward surface radiation and surface-to-atmosphere sensible and latent heat transport in the SH relative to the NH exhibit anomalous northward AHT(EQ) and overestimate SH tropical precipitation. The hemispheric bias in net surface radiative flux is due to too much longwave surface radiative cooling in the NH tropics in both clear and all-sky conditions and excessive shortwave surface radiation in the SH subtropics and extratropics due to an underestimation in reflection by clouds.

AB The E3SM Diagnostics Package (E3SM Diags) is a modern, Python-based Earth system model (ESM) evaluation tool (with Python module name e3sm_diags), developed to support the Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). E3SM Diags provides a wide suite of tools for evaluating native E3SM output, as well as ESM data on regular latitude-longitude grids, including output from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) class models. E3SM Diags is modeled after the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Atmosphere Model Working Group diagnostics package. In its version 1 release, E3SM Diags included a set of core essential diagnostics to evaluate the mean physical climate from model simulations. As of version 2.7, more process-oriented and phenomenon-based evaluation diagnostics have been implemented, such as analysis of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), streamflow, the diurnal cycle of precipitation, tropical cyclones, ozone and aerosol properties. An in situ dataset from DOE's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program has been integrated into the package for evaluating the representation of simulated cloud and precipitation processes. This tool is designed with enough flexibility to allow for the addition of new observational datasets and new diagnostic algorithms. Additional features include customizable figures; streamlined installation, configuration and execution; and multiprocessing for fast computation. The package uses an up-to-date observational data repository maintained by its developers, where recent datasets are added to the repository as they become available. Finally, several applications for the E3SM Diags module were introduced to fit a diverse set of use cases from the scientific community.

AB Experience in numerical weather prediction suggests that singular value decomposition (SVD) of a forecast can yield useful a priori information about the growth of forecast errors. It has been shown formally that SVD using the inverse of the expected analysis error covariance matrix to define the norm at initial time yields the Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) of the forecast error covariance matrix at the final time. Because of their connection to the 2nd derivative of the cost function in 4-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation, the initial time singular vectors defined in this way are often referred to as the Hessian Singular Vectors (HSVs). In the present study, estimates of ocean forecast errors and forecast error covariance were computed using SVD applied to a baroclinically unstable temperature front in a re-entrant channel using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). An identical twin approach was used in which a truth run of the model was sampled to generate synthetic hydrographic observations that were then assimilated into the same model started from an incorrect initial condition using 4D-Var. The 4D-Var system was run sequentially, and forecasts were initialized from each ocean analysis. SVD was performed on the resulting forecasts to compute the HSVs and corresponding EOFs of the expected forecast error covariance matrix. In this study, a reduced rank approximation of the inverse expected analysis error covariance matrix was used to compute the HSVs and EOFs based on the Lanczos vectors computed during the 4D-Var minimization of the cost function. This has the advantage that the entire spectrum of HSVs and EOFs in the reduced space can be computed. The associated singular value spectrum is found to yield consistent and reliable estimates of forecast error variance in the space spanned by the EOFs. In addition, at long forecast lead times the resulting HSVs and companion EOFs are able to capture many features of the actual realized forecast error at the largest scales. Forecast error growth via the HSVs was found to be significantly influenced by the non-normal character of the underlying forecast circulation, and is accompanied by a forward energy cascade, suggesting that forecast errors could be effectively controlled by reducing the error at the largest scales in the forecast initial conditions. A predictive relation for the amplitude of the basin integrated forecast error in terms of the mean aspect ratio of the forecast error hyperellipse (quantified in terms of the mean eccentricity) was also identified which could prove useful for predicting the level of forecast error a priori. All of these findings were found to be insensitive to the configuration of the 4D-Var data assimilation system and the resolution of the observing network. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Size spectrum of biological particles directly affects nutrient cycling and energy flow distribution of marine ecosystems. Fast and accurate detection of the size and distribution of marine phytoplankton plays a very important role for in-depth study of physiological characteristics of marine phytoplankton community structure and function. In this paper, a novel detection method and system of size spectrum of microalgae cells on a microfluidic chip is presented. In this device, a microfluidic resistance pulse sensor (RPS) technology is adopted to determine the particle size of microalgae cells; chlorophyll fluorescence intensity is used to judge if a particle is a live microalgae cell or not. Inside a waterproof case, the system mainly comprises a microfluidic chip platform, a sample acquisition module, an optoelectronic detection unit, and a module performing data acquisition, data processing and system control. To demonstrate the performance of the developed system, experiments were conducted with three species of microalgae cells (Isochrysis galbana, Dunaliella sauna and Tetraselmis chui), typical phytoplankton cells in marine environments, as samples. Comparison experiments between the developed detection system and a commercial flow cytometer were conducted. The results demonstrate that the developed system is reliable and accurate. The limit of detection of microalgae cell size is 3 tun for the current device and can be improved in the future. The presented microfluidic system provides a very promising method of size spectrum detection of microalgae cells with the advantages such as fast detection, small size and easy operation. It has a great potential for in-situ underwater detection of micro phytoplanktons pending further product development. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB High-CO2 induced ocean acidification (OA) reduces the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) saturation level (Omega) and the pH of oceans. Consequently, OA is causing a serious threat to several ecologically and economically important biomineralising molluscs. Biomineralisation is a highly controlled biochemical process by which molluscs deposit their calcareous structures. In this process, shell matrix proteins aid the nucleation, growth and assemblage of the CaCO3 crystals in the shell. These molluscan shell proteins (MSPs) are, ultimately, responsible for determination of the diverse shell microstructures and mechanical strength. Recent studies have attempted to integrate gene and protein expression data of MSPs with shell structure and mechanical properties. These advances made in understanding the molecular mechanism of biomineralisation suggest that molluscs either succumb or adapt to OA stress. In this review, we discuss the fate of biomineralisation process in future high-CO2 oceans and its ultimate impact on the mineralised shell's structure and mechanical properties from the perspectives of limited substrate availability theory, proton flux limitation model and the omega myth theory.
   Furthermore, studying the interplay of energy availability and differential gene expression is an essential first step towards understanding adaptation of molluscan biomineralisation to OA, because if there is a need to change gene expression under stressors, any living system would require more energy than usual. To conclude, we have listed, four important future research directions for molecular adaptation of molluscan biomineralisation in high-CO2 oceans: 1) Including an energy budgeting factor while understanding differential gene expression of MSPs and ion transporters under OA. 2) Unraveling the genetic or epigenetic changes related to biomineralisation under stressors to help solving a bigger picture about future evolution of molluscs, and 3) Understanding Post Translational Modifications of MSPs with and without stressors. 4) Understanding carbon uptake mechanisms across taxa with and without OA to clarify the OA theories on Omega.

AB The rapid expansion of offshore wind farms (OWFs) in European seas is accompanied by many challenges, including efficient and safe operation and maintenance, environmental protection, and biodiversity conservation. Effective decision-making for industry and environmental agencies relies on timely, multi-disciplinary marine data to assess the current state and predict the future state of the marine system. Due to high connectivity in space (land-estuarial-coastal sea), socioeconomic (multi-sectoral and cross-board), and environmental and ecological processes in sea areas containing OWFs, marine observations should be fit for purpose in relation to multiple OWF applications. This study represents an effort to map the major observation requirements (Part-I), identify observation gaps, and recommend solutions to fill those gaps (Part-II) in order to address multi-dimension challenges for the OWF industry. In Part-I, six targeted areas are selected, including OWF operation and maintenance, protection of submarine cables, wake and lee effects, transport and security, contamination, and ecological impact assessments. For each application area, key information products are identified, and integrated modeling-monitoring solutions for generating the information products are proposed based on current state-of-the-art methods. The observation requirements for these solutions, in terms of variables and spatial and temporal sampling needs, are therefore identified.

AB Interest in the study of next-generation underwater sensor networks for ocean investigation has increased owing to developing concerns over its utilization in areas, such as oceanography, commercial operations in maritime areas, and military surveillance. The underwater base station controller, in the form of a surface buoy, communicates with underwater base stations (UBSs) while the UBSs transceiver information with underwater sensor nodes via acoustic communications. This paper provides a link-level and system-level study of downlinks using an orthogonal frequency-division multiple access techniques for underwater acoustic communications (UAC) networks. We present an approach to link-level-to-system-level (L2S) mapping at the link level that provides an abstraction model of the link-level performance to be accessed by system-level simulation (SLS). In this paper, an exponential effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) mapping (EESM) method is adopted, which elaborates on how multi-state channels are integrated into a single state in an SLS, and why an effective SNR can represent the characteristics of a multiple subcarrier SNR. Moreover, we explain the beta calibration procedure in detail for a UAC network. The simulation results are provided to verify the beta calibration of the UAC network. Furthermore, we employ a link adaptation strategy by evaluating system throughput based on a proportional fair (PF) scheduler at the system level. Hence, the simulation results confirm the effectiveness of link adaptation strategy for UAC networks.

AB Using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instrument, and a radiative transfer model (RTM), we provide a quantitative assessment of regional cloud-free diurnally averaged shortwave Aerosol Radiative Effects (AREs) at the top of atmosphere (TOA) and at the surface over Southeast Asia (SEAS, 10 degrees S-20 N and 90 degrees E-130 degrees E). The spatial and temporal variations of the annual ARE are calculated based on satellite and ground-based measurements, supplemented by radiative transfer simulations. During 2001-2010, our results indicate that the TOA diurnally averaged ARE is -5.6 +/- 0.8 Wm(-2) over land and -4.8 +/- 0.7 Wm(-2) over ocean, respectively. In contrast, the surface ARE is -13.8 +/- 3.2 Wm(-2) based on radiative transfer calculations. For aerosol layers of 2 km in height with midvisible optical depth of 1.41 and single scattering albedo of 0.91, the shortwave radiative heating can exceed 0.8 K/day. Our results indicate significant inter-annual variability of aerosol radiative properties, which is extremely large over major emission outflow regions like SEAS. This study suggests that an integrated system of satellite data, model calculations coupled with ground-based and meteorological data sets is needed to assess Aerosol Radiative Effects on regional earth-atmosphere energy budgets.

AB Accidental release of nuclides into the ocean is causing health risks to marine organisms and humans. All life forms are susceptible to gamma radiation with a high variation, depending on various physical factors such as dose, mode, and time of exposure and various biological factors such as species, vitality, age, and gender. Differences in sensitivity of gamma radiation are also associated with different efficiencies of mechanisms related to protection and repair systems. Gamma radiation may also affect various other integration levels: from gene, protein, cells and organs, population, and communities, disturbing the energy flow of food webs that will ultimately affect the structure and functioning of ecosystems. Depending on exposure levels, gamma radiation induces damages on growth and reproduction in various organisms such as zooplankton, benthos, and fish in aquatic ecosystems. In this paper, harmful effects of gamma-irradiated aquatic organisms are described and the potential of marine copepods in assessing the risk of gamma radiation is discussed with respect to physiological adverse effects that even affect the ecosystem level.

AB When tropical cyclones (TCs) move to the mid-latitudes, they oftentimes undergo extratropical transition (ET) by which they lose their symmetry and warm-core characteristics. Upon transforming into extratropical cyclones (ETCs), they tend to impact larger areas and thus larger populations. In light of the increased TC intensity due to global warming identified in previous studies, here we examine its effect on the frequency and destructiveness of ET events globally using a high-resolution fully coupled Earth System model (0.25 & DEG; for atmosphere; 0.1 & DEG; for ocean) prescribed with present-day, doubling, and quadrupling CO2 concentrations. Our findings indicate that ETCs originated from the tropics with higher destructiveness (indicated by integrated kinetic energy) become more frequent in response to greenhouse warming, although the number of ET events does not change significantly. The key factor in the change in the destructiveness of ETCs is the increase in wind speed and the high-wind area at ET. Despite the uncertainty in the Northern Hemisphere, our results underscore the necessity for climate resilience in the mid-latitudes against global warming.

AB Polymetallic nodules found in the deep oceans are viewed as potential resources for meeting the world's demand of many metals in the near future. Polymetallic nodule mining systems require subsea crushing systems for reducing the size of nodules to facilitate energy-efficient and safe pumping through risers of optimum size. Polymetallic nodules are friable, and deep-sea crushing has to be done with care to minimize the formation of fines, while obtaining the required size reduction. The crusher could also encounter objects with greater hardness during operation like small rocks, splinters, long fish bones, and shark teeth. All components in the crusher should be capable of operating in the deep ocean environment, which is hyperbaric and sediment laden. The equipment should be compact with minimum weight. Reversal of direction and dumping arrangements in the event of stalling are other essential design requirements. An underwater crusher capable of crushing mined nodules from a maximum size of 100 mm to a crushed size of 30 mm was developed using principles of design synthesis. The crusher was tested in land and integrated into a remotely operated crawler-based underwater mining machine that could mine and pump nodules through a flexible riser. The system was tested using artificial nodules at 512-m water depth off the Malvan coast in the Arabian Sea. This paper describes developmental methodology, land-based performance tests, and sea trials conducted on the developed crusher.

AB Estuarine systems are critical transition zones influenced by sea, land and freshwater. An array of human activi-ties impacts these areas leading to multiple-stressor interactions. Temperature and salinity are among the most relevant drivers in estuaries, shaping species growth, reproduction and distribution. However, few studies provide an overview of cellular rewiring processes under multiple-stressor environments. Here, we tested how salinity could shape the response of ragworms Hediste diversicolor, an important bioindicator and commercial species, to elevated temperature. We exposed polychaetes to three temperatures for a month, simulating control, ocean warming and heatwave conditions (24, 27 and 30 degrees C, respectively) combined with two salinities (20 and 30). We quantified whole-organism performance (wet weight gain and survival), along with cellular stress re-sponse (CSR) and energy reserves of worms after 14 and 28 days of exposure. Significant three-way interactions between temperature, salinity and exposure time show the non-linearity of molecular responses. Worms at a salinity of 20 were more sensitive to warming than worms exposed to a salinity of 30. The combination of high temperature and low salinity can act synergistically to induce oxidative stress and macromolecular damage in worm tissues. This finding was supported by an induction of the CSR, with a concomitant decrease of energy reserves, pointing towards a metabolic compensation strategy. However, under a higher salinity (30), the need for a CSR upon thermal challenge was reduced and energy content increased with temperature, which suggests that environmental conditions were within the optimum range. Heatwaves striking low-salinity areas of estuaries can therefore negatively impact the cellular physiology of H. diversicolor, with greater metabolic costs. However, extreme stress levels were not reached as worms incremented wet weight and survival was high under all conditions tested. Our findings are important for the optimization of ragworm aquaculture and adaptive conservation strategies of estuarine systems. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The increasing demand for renewable energy is projected to result in a 40-fold increase in offshore wind electricity in the European Union by 2030. Despite a great number of local impact studies for selected marine populations, the regional ecosystem impacts of offshore wind farm (OWF) structures are not yet well assessed nor understood. Our study investigates whether the accumulation of epifauna, dominated by the filter feeder Mytilus edulis (blue mussel), on turbine structures affects pelagic primary productivity and ecosystem functioning in the southern North Sea. We estimate the anthropogenically increased potential distribution based on the current projections of turbine locations and reported patterns of M. edulis settlement. This distribution is integrated through the Modular Coupling System for Shelves and Coasts to state-of-the-art hydrodynamic and ecosystem models. Our simulations reveal non-negligible potential changes in regional annual primary productivity of up to 8% within the OWF area, and induced maximal increases of the same magnitude in daily productivity also far from the wind farms. Our setup and modular coupling are effective tools for system scale studies of other environmental changes arising from large-scale offshore wind farming such as ocean physics and distributions of pelagic top predators.

AB This project explored the integrated use of satellite, ground observations and hydrological distributed models to support water resources assessment and monitoring in High Mountain Asia (HMA). Hydrological data products were generated taking advantage of the synergies of European and Chinese data assets and space-borne observation systems. Energy-budget-based glacier mass balance and hydrological models driven by satellite observations were developed. These models can be applied to describe glacier-melt contribution to river flow. Satellite hydrological data products were used for forcing, calibration, validation and data assimilation in distributed river basin models. A pilot study was carried out on the Red River basin. Multiple hydrological data products were generated using the data collected by Chinese satellites. A new Evapo-Transpiration (ET) dataset from 2000 to 2018 was generated, including plant transpiration, soil evaporation, rainfall interception loss, snow/ice sublimation and open water evaporation. Higher resolution data were used to characterize glaciers and their response to environmental forcing. These studies focused on the Parlung Zangbo Basin, where glacier facies were mapped with GaoFeng (GF), Sentinal-2/Multi-Spectral Imager (S2/MSI) and Landsat8/Operational Land Imager (L8/OLI) data. The geodetic mass balance was estimated between 2000 and 2017 with Zi-Yuan (ZY)-3 Stereo Images and the SRTM DEM. Surface velocity was studied with Landsat5/Thematic Mapper (L5/TM), L8/OLI and S2/MSI data over the period 2013-2019. An updated method was developed to improve the retrieval of glacier albedo by correcting glacier reflectance for anisotropy, and a new dataset on glacier albedo was generated for the period 2001-2020. A detailed glacier energy and mass balance model was developed with the support of field experiments at the Parlung No. 4 Glacier and the 24 K Glacier, both in the Tibetan Plateau. Besides meteorological measurements, the field experiments included glaciological and hydrological measurements. The energy balance model was formulated in terms of enthalpy for easier treatment of water phase transitions. The model was applied to assess the spatial variability in glacier melt. In the Parlung No. 4 Glacier, the accumulated glacier melt was between 1.5 and 2.5 m w.e. in the accumulation zone and between 4.5 and 6.0 m w.e. in the ablation zone, reaching 6.5 m w.e. at the terminus. The seasonality in the glacier mass balance was observed by combining intensive field campaigns with continuous automatic observations. The linkage of the glacier and snowpack mass balance with water resources in a river basin was analyzed in the Chiese (Italy) and Heihe (China) basins by developing and applying integrated hydrological models using satellite retrievals in multiple ways. The model FEST-WEB was calibrated using retrievals of Land Surface Temperature (LST) to map soil hydrological properties. A watershed model was developed by coupling ecohydrological and socioeconomic systems. Integrated modeling is supported by an updated and parallelized data assimilation system. The latter exploits retrievals of brightness temperature (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer, AMSR), LST (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MODIS), precipitation (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and FengYun (FY)-2D) and in-situ measurements.
   In the case study on the Red River Basin, a new algorithm has been applied to disaggregate the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) soil moisture retrievals by making use of the correlation between evaporative fraction and soil moisture.

AB The Itsukushima Shrine is located in northern Hiroshima Bay in the Seto Inland Sea (SIS). This structure of great cultural value is preserved as one of the World Heritage Sites in Japan. The shrine was built seaside, 30 cm above the highest tide, to prevent it from submerging. However, from 2011 to 2019, the shrine was submerged four times during September due to internal surges. To study the abnormal tide event on 29 September 2011, a high-resolution numerical ocean circulation model was established using Semi-implicit Cross-scale Hydroscience Integrated System Model (SCHISM). Observed subtidal components of surface elevation in the northern part of the bay decreased due to northerly winds when the typhoon passed east off the bay. After 7-8 days of typhoon passage, the component increased abnormally in the northern part of the bay. Simulation results revealed that a destabilized density stratification by the typhoon winds most likely caused bay-scale internal waves. The internal wave developed after the typhoon passed and was caught from the kinetic energy filtered in the possible internal wave periods. The internal wave propagated southward after the typhoon passage and returned to the northern bay, causing the subtidal component to increase after 7-8 days. Sensitivity tests with various scales of the typhoon were performed, and the test results exhibited a positive relationship between the abnormal tide level and typhoon intensity to some extent. The results can be generally applied to a semi-closed bay or closed water body for internal wave generation and propagation under specific meteorological conditions for coastal protection and disaster prevention.

AB Shipping carries virtually all internationally traded goods. Major commercial ports are fully integrated into transnational production and distribution systems, enabling the circulation of massive flows of energy and materials in the global economy. Port activity and development are usually associated with positive socio-economic effects, such as increased GDP and employment, but the industry's continuous expansion produces adverse outcomes including air and water pollution, the destruction of marine and coastal environments, waterfront congestion, health risks, and labor issues. In its quest to marry economic growth and environmental sustainability in the maritime industries, proponents of the newly coined blue growth paradigm assume the negative impacts of ports and shipping to be fixable mostly through technological innovation. This paper questions the validity of the premise that the unlimited growth of the port and shipping industries is compatible with environmental sustainability and analyses the feasibility of technological improvements to offset the sector's associated negative impacts. Based on insights from ecological economics and political ecology, ports can be described as power-laden assemblages of spaces, flows, and actors, which produce unequally distributed socio-ecological benefits and burdens at multiple scales. Focusing on the case of the Port of Barcelona, this study argues that the continuous expansion of port activity increases seldom accounted-for negative socio-environmental impacts, acquiring an uneconomic character for port cities and regions. In contrast, de-growth is presented as a radical sustainability alternative to ocean-based growth paradigms. The paper concludes by discussing its prospective 'blue' articulation in the context of maritime transportation while offering some avenues for future research and policymaking.

AB Field experiments were conducted to test and evaluate the initial atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) measurement capability of airborne, high-energy, double-pulsed, 2-mu m integrated path differential absorption (IPDA) lidar. This IPDA was designed, integrated, and operated at the NASA Langley Research Center on-board the NASA B-200 aircraft. The IPDA was tuned to the CO2 strong absorption line at 2050.9670 nm, which is the optimum for lower tropospheric weighted column measurements. Flights were conducted over land and ocean under different conditions. The first validation experiments of the IPDA for atmospheric CO2 remote sensing, focusing on low surface reflectivity oceanic surface returns during full day background conditions, are presented. In these experiments, the IPDA measurements were validated by comparison to airborne flask air-sampling measurements conducted by the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory. IPDA performance modeling was conducted to evaluate measurement sensitivity and bias errors. The IPDA signals and their variation with altitude compare well with predicted model results. In addition, off-off-line testing was conducted, with fixed instrument settings, to evaluate the IPDA systematic and random errors. Analysis shows an altitude-independent differential optical depth offset of 0.0769. Optical depth measurement uncertainty of 0.0918 compares well with the predicted value of 0.0761. IPDA CO2 column measurement compares well with model-driven, near-simultaneous air-sampling measurements from the NOAA aircraft at different altitudes. With a 10-s shot average, CO2 differential optical depth measurement of 1.0054 +/- 0.0103 was retrieved from a 6-km altitude and a 4-GHz on-line operation. As compared to CO2 weighted-average column dry-air volume mixing ratio of 404.08 ppm, derived from air sampling, IPDA measurement resulted in a value of 405.22 +/- 4.15 ppm with 1.02% uncertainty and 0.28% additional bias. Sensitivity analysis of environmental systematic errors correlates the additional bias to water vapor. IPDA ranging resulted in a measurement uncertainty of < 3 m. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America

AB Coastal regions are essential to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) given their importance for human habitation, resource provisioning, employment, and cultural practice. They are also regions where different ecological, disciplinary, and jurisdictional boundaries both overlap and are obscured. We thus propose the land sea interface as areas where governance systems are most in need of frameworks for systems analysis to meet the SDGs-which are inherently interconnected- and integrate complex interdependencies between human livelihoods, energy, transport, food production, and nutrient flows (among others). We propose a strategic land sea governance framework built on the sustainable transitions literature to plan for governance to achieve sustainable development across the land-sea interface. To illustrate our proposal, we compare governance planning processes across four case based scenarios: an industrialized coastal country, a least developed coastal country, a developing coastal country with local dependencies on ocean resources, and a small island developing state primarily dependent on tourism. Through the lens of aligning governance actors and actions vertically (subnational to national), horizontally (across sectors), and programmatically (from goals to implementation), we propose scales at which governance systems may be misaligned, such as where different agencies that affect marine systems have conflicting visions and goals, leading to stalled progress or counterproductive actions. Where possible, we also highlight strategies to align across scales of high level strategic policy, tactical scale institutional mandates and cooperation, and on the ground activities and operations, such as aligning actors based on an analysis of interdependencies of goals.

AB This paper aims to study the effects of fish nets on the nonlinear dynamic performance of a floating offshore wind turbine integrated with a steel fish farming cage (FOWT-SFFC). Fully coupled aero-hydro-servo-elastic numerical models of FOWT-SFFC, with and without nets, are constructed to probe the nonlinear time-domain stochastic response. The first-order potential flow model with quadratic drag forces is employed to calculate the hydrodynamic loading on the foundation. The effects of nets on the damping ratios of 6 degree-of-freedom motions and on their displacement response amplitude operators (RAOs) are respectively investigated in numerical decay tests and monochromatic regular waves. The results show that the nets help to increase the damping level for the whole system and reduce motion RAOs when wave periods are around the natural periods of motions, while nets play insignificant role in motions when wave periods are far away from motion natural periods. The dynamic performances of FOWT-SFFC with and without nets under random ocean waves, the combined random wind and random waves as well as current are comprehensively compared and discussed. The simulation results indicate that in wind-sea dominated conditions, the nets tend to slightly increase the dynamic responses of FOWT-SFFC, especially the components corresponding to natural periods. Nonetheless, under sea states that comprise both wind-sea waves and swell, nets help to reduce the dynamic responses of FOWT-SFFC by introducing additional damping.

AB Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC) offer a valuable alternative to recover waste heat from internal combustion engines (ICE) in transportation systems, leading to fuel energy savings and reduced emissions. Nevertheless, the additional weight of the ORC affects the net energy balance of the overall system and the ORC occupies additional volume that competes with vehicle transportation capacity. A lower income from delivered freight or passenger tickets will be therefore achieved. This work defines a benchmark for the economic feasibility of integrating an ORC into an ICE and the resulting economic impact of weight and volume in the transportation sector. It additionally investigates the current ORC situation on the market.
   The applied methodology defines a maximum allowable change of transport capacity caused by the integration of the ORC. The procedure is applied to a typical city bus, a truck of 40 t of payload capacity, a middle-size freight train (1000 t), an inland water vessel (Va RoRo, 2500 t) and ocean vessel (25,000 t). The results are compared with commercial ORC products.
   The findings of the present study are a theoretical and practical approach for the economic application of ORCs in the transportation sector. For maritime transportation, the situation appears highly favorable. For integration for trains and trucks appeared successful, but close to the limit line. For busses, a competitive integration requires a strong reduction in weight and volume.
   In future works, the potential for volume and mass reduction of the ORC has to be addressed together with the integration of an economic assessment for the ORC. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In shallow water acoustical environment, the propagation of radiated noise of complex structure is determined by the frequency responding properties, spatial directivity, seabed acoustic absorption and the stratification of the sound speed of water. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the propagated noise of complex structure in ocean acoustic environment. In this study, a shaft-hull system (SHS) is established based on the Suboff submarine, the coupled finite element / boundary element (FE/BE) method is adopted to acquire the source strength distribution of the structure, the ray-normal mode theory is used to obtain the sound field Green function in shallow waters, and the closed virtual impedance surface (CVIS) method is employed to eliminate the irregular frequency. On these bases, the radiated sound intensity level (SIL) is decomposed according to the coupling pattern of dry structural modes and sound field normal modes, and the smooth average sound energy is extracted of the radiated noise. It is found that: (1) the non -dimensional irregular frequency of Suboff hull can be estimated with fair precision with reference to the analytical expression of the irregular frequency of slender cylindrical shell (SCS) because the main structure of Suboff is an SCS; (2) the decaying smooth average properties of complex structures can be obtained by only considering the incoherent energy induced by identical sound field normal mode; (3) the far field decaying pattern of complicated structures is approximately similar to that of a monopole source in shallow sea with a soft seabed.

AB The use of a multi-functional autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) as a platform for making turbulence measurements in the ocean is developed. The layout optimization of the turbulence package and platform motion performance are limitation problems in turbulent AUV design. In this study, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method has been used to determine the optimized layout position and distance of the shear probe integrated into an AUV. When placed 0.8 D ahead of the AUV nose along the axis, the shear probe is not influenced by flow distortion and can contact the water body first. To analyze the motion of the turbulence AUV, the dynamic model of turbulence AUV for planar flight is obtained. Then, the mathematical equations of speed and angle of attack under steady-state motion have also been obtained. By calculating the hydrodynamic coefficients of the turbulence AUV and given system parameters, the simulation analysis has been conducted. The simulation results demonstrated that the speed of turbulent AUV is 0.5-1 m/s, and the maximum angle of attack is less than 6.5 degrees, which meets the observation requirements of the shear probe. In addition, turbulence AUV conducted a series of sea-trials in the northern South China Sea to illustrate the validity of the design and measurement. Two continuous profiles (1000 m) with a horizontal distance of 10 km were completed, and numerous high-quality spatiotemporal turbulence data were obtained. These profiles demonstrate the superior flight performance of turbulence AUV. Analysis shows that the measured data are of high quality, with the shear spectra being in very good agreement with the Nasmyth spectrum. Dissipation rates are consistent with background shear. When shear velocity is weak, the measurement of dissipation rate is 10(-10) W Kg(-1). All indications are that the turbulence AUV is suitable for long-term, contiguous ocean microstructure measurements, which will provide data needed to understand the temporal and spatial variability of the turbulent processes in the oceans.

AB Marine ecosystems are characterized by an intricate set of interactions. One of the most important occurs through the exchange of dissolved organic matter (DOM) provided by phototrophs and used by heterotrophic bacteria as their main carbon and energy source. This metabolic interaction represents the foundation of the entire ocean food-web.
   Here we have assembled a synthetic ecosystem to assist the systems-level investigation of this biological association. This was achieved by building an integrated, genome-scale metabolic reconstruction using two model organisms (a diatom Phaeodactylurn tricornutum and an heterotrophic bacterium, Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis). The model was initially analysed using a constraint-based approach (Flux Balance Analysis, FBA) and then turned into a dynamic (dFBA) model to simulate a diatom-bacteria co-culture and to study the effect of changes in growth parameters on such a system. Furthermore, we developed a simpler dynamic Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) system that, fed with dFBA results, was able to qualitatively describe this synthetic ecosystem and allowed performing stochastic simulations to assess the effect of noise on the overall balance of this co-culture.
   We show that our model represents known metabolic cross-talks of a phototroph-heterotroph system, including mutualism and competition for inorganic ions (i.e., phosphate and sulphate). In addition, the dynamic simulation predicts realistic growth rates for both the diatom and the bacterium and a steady-state balance between diatom and bacterial cell concentration that matches those determined in experimental co-cultures. This steady state, however, is reached following an oscillatory trend, a behaviour that is typically observed in the presence of metabolic co-dependencies. Finally, we show that, at high diatom/bacteria cell concentration ratio, stochastic fluctuations can lead to the extinction of bacteria from the co-culture, causing an explosion of diatom population. We anticipate that the developed synthetic ecosystem will serve as a basis for the generation of testable hypotheses and as a scaffold for integrating and interpreting-omits data from experimental co-cultures.

TI A compact NaI(Tl) with avalanche photodiode gamma spectrometer for in
   situ radioactivity measurements in marine environment
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
LA English
DT Article
AB In situ radioactivity measurements in a deep ocean environment are essential for marine environmental pollution monitoring and seabed geological exploration. In the past, the most widely used gamma spectrometers were based on towed instrumentation, which could only be operated underwater at a depth of less than 1500 m. In this study, a compact gamma spectrometer with small-size, light weight, and low power consumption was designed for working in a marine in situ environment. This spectrometer, with two essential parts: detector and electronics, was designed to work on different underwater platforms in the real-time control mode or autonomous operation mode. Multiple small volume avalanche photodiodes were coupled with NaI(Tl), which can significantly reduce the spectrometer volume compared with the option of the photomultiplier tube. Integrated readout electronics were employed to digitize all detector signals for miniaturization and low power consumption. The field programmable gate array (FPGA) was used to obtain the energy spectrum in real-time and an online multi-channel summation with temperature calibration algorithm was employed to improve detection efficiency. Relevant tests were also conducted in the laboratory to evaluate critical techniques and system performance. Results show that the energy resolution (full width at half maximum over the peak position) was similar to 7.5% at 662 keV, verifying the online multi-channel summation with temperature calibration based on the FPGA. Moreover, the compact prototype spectrometer worked well in the power-on hydraulic test.

AB As changes to Earth's polar climate accelerate, the need for robust, long-term sea ice thickness observation datasets for monitoring those changes and for verification of global climate models is clear. By linking an algorithm for retrieving snow-ice interface temperature from passive microwave satellite data to a thermodynamic sea ice energy balance relation known as Stefan's law, we have developed a retrieval method for estimating thermodynamic sea ice thickness growth from space: Stefan's Law Integrated Conducted Energy (SLICE). With an initial condition at the beginning of the sea ice growth season, the method can model basin-wide absolute sea ice thickness by combining the one-dimensional SLICE retrieval with an ice motion dataset. The advantages of the SLICE retrieval method include daily basin-wide coverage, lack of atmospheric reanalysis product input requirement, and a potential for use beginning in 1987. Validation of the retrieval against measurements from 10 ice mass balance buoys shows a mean correlation of 0.89 and a mean bias of 0.06 m over the course of an entire sea ice growth season. Despite its simplifications and assumptions relative to models like the Pan-Arctic Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS), basin-wide SLICE performs nearly as well as PIOMAS when compared against CryoSat-2 and Operation IceBridge using a linear correlation between collocated points.

TI Transformation of internal solitary waves at the edge of ice cover
SO NONLINEAR PROCESSES IN GEOPHYSICS

DT Article
ID SIMULATIONS; SYSTEM
AB Internal wave-driven mixing is an important factor in the balance of heat and salt fluxes in the polar regions of the ocean. Transformation of internal waves at the edge of the ice cover can enhance the mixing and melting of ice in the Arctic Ocean and Antarctica. In the polar oceans, internal solitary waves (ISWs) are generated by various sources, including tidal currents over bottom topography, the interaction of ice keels with tides, time-varying winds, vortices, and lee waves. In this study, a numerical investigation of the transformation of ISWs propagating from open water in the stratified sea under the edge of the ice cover is carried out to compare the depression ISW transformation and loss of energy on smooth ice surfaces, including those on the ice shelf and glacier outlets, with the processes beneath the ridged underside of the ice. They were carried out using a non-hydrostatic model that is based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations in the Boussinesq approximation for a continuously stratified fluid. The Smagorinsky turbulence model extended for stratified fluid was used to describe the small-scale turbulent mixing explicitly. Two series of numerical experiments were carried out in an idealized 2D setup. The first series aimed to study the processes of the ISWs of depression transformation under an ice cover of constant submerged ice thickness. Energy loss was estimated based on a budget of depth-integrated pseudoenergy before and after the wave transformation. The transformation of ISWs of depressions is controlled by the blocking parameter beta , which is the ratio of the minimum thickness of the upper layer under the ice cover to the incident wave amplitude. The energy loss was relatively small for large positive and large negative values of beta . The maximal value of energy loss was about 38 %, and it was reached at beta approximate to 0 for ISWs. In the second series of experiments, a number of keels were located on the underside of the constant-thickness ice layer. The ISW transformation under ridged ice also depends on the blocking parameter beta . For large keels ( beta < 0 ), more than 40 % of energy is lost on the first keel, while for relatively small keels ( beta > 0.3 ), the losses on the first keel are less than 6 %. Energy losses due to all keels depend on the distance between them, which is characterized by the parameter mu , i.e. the ratio of keel depth to the distance between keels. In turn, for a finite length of the ice layer, the distance between keels depends on the keel quantity.

AB Production of electricity using hydrokinetic tidal turbines has many challenges that must be overcome to ensure reliable, economic and practical solutions. Kinetic energy from flowing water is converted to electricity by a system comprising diverse mechanical and electrical components from the rotor blades up to the electricity grid. To date these have often been modelled using simulations of independent systems, lacking bi-directional, real-time, coupling. This approach leads to critical effects being missed. Turbulence in the flow, results in large velocity fluctuations around the blades, causing rapid variation in the shaft torque and generator speed, and consequently in the voltage seen by the power electronics and so compromising the export power quality. Conversely, grid frequency and voltage changes can also cause the generator speed to change, resulting in changes to the shaft speed and torque and consequently changes to the hydrodynamics acting on the blades. Clearly, fully integrated, bi-directional, models are needed. Here we present two fully coupled models which use different approaches to model the hydrodynamics of rotor blades. The first model uses the Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT), resulting in an efficient tool for turbine designers. The second model also uses BEMT, combines this with an actuator line model of the blades coupled to an unsteady computational fluid dynamics simulation by OpenFOAM (CFD/BEMT). Each model is coupled to an OpenModelica model of the electro-mechanical system by an energy balance to compute the shaft speed. Each coupled system simulates the performance of a 1.2 m diameter, three-bladed horizontal axis tidal turbine tested in the University of Edinburgh FloWave Ocean Energy Research Facility. The turbulent flow around the blades and the mechanical-electrical variables during the stable period of operation are analysed. Time series and tabulated average values of thrust, torque, power, and rotational speed, as well as, electrical variables of generator power, electromagnetic torque, voltage and current are presented for the coupled system simulation. The relationship between the mechanical and electrical variables and the results from both tidal turbine approaches are discussed. Our comparison shows that while the BEMT model provides an effective design tool (leading to slightly more conservative designs), the CFD/BEMT simulations show the turbulence influence in the mechanical and electrical variables which can be especially important in assessing an additional source of stresses in the whole electro-mechanical system (though at an increased computational cost).

AB In this work, we present a novel MPC-integrated multiphase IB framework that can compute the optimal energy-maximizing control force "on-the-fly"by dynamically interacting with a high-fidelity numerical wave tank (NWT). The computational model closely mimics the working setup of the device at its site of operation. Due to the requirement of solving a constrained optimization problem at each time step of the IB simulation, the MPC algorithm utilizes a low-dimensional dynamical model of the device that is based on the linear potential theory (LPT). The multiphase IB solver, on the other hand, is based on the high-dimensional fictitious domain Brinkman penalization (FD/BP) method, which fully-resolves the hydrodynamic non-linearities associated with the wave-structure interaction (WSI). A time-series forecasting auto-regressive model is implemented that predicts wave heights (from the past NWT data) to estimate the future wave excitation/Froude-Krylov forces for the MPC algorithm. Moreover, we also experiment with non-linear Froude-Krylov (NLFK) forces for the first time in an MPC formulation. The NLFK forces are computed efficiently using a static Cartesian grid, in which the WEC geometry is implicitly represented by a signed distance function. Under varying sea conditions, the predictions of the MPC-integrated multiphase IB solver are compared to the widely popular LPT-based solvers. In agitated sea conditions and/or under aggressive control, the LPT-based WSI solvers produce too optimistic (and misleading) power output values. Overall, six WSI/MPC solver combinations are compared for a heaving vertical cylinder to determine the reasons for discrepancies between high-and low-fidelity predictions. We also determine the pathway of energy transfer from the waves to the power take-off (PTO) system and verify the relationships using IB simulations. Additionally, three different sea states are simulated within the IB simulation to test the adaptive capability of MPC for WECs. MPC is demonstrated to adapt to changing sea conditions and find the optimal solution for each sea state.The interaction between the distributed-memory parallel multiphase IB solver (written in C++) and the serial MPC solver (written in MATLAB) is fully described to facilitate reproducibility. A bespoke communication layer between the two solvers is developed, which can be easily modified by the WEC community to experiment with other optimal controllers and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers. All codes for this work are made open-source for pedagogical and research purposes.

AB In this study, the global surface divergent eddy heat flux (EHF) is estimated using remote sensing observations of sea surface height (SSH) and sea surface temperature (SST) over two decades (1993-2017). These results are used as a metric to assess model fidelity in a mesoscale eddy-resolving version of the Community Earth System Model. The estimated EHFs show that the midlatitudes significantly contribute to the poleward transport of heat because of strong regional variability in SSH and SST. A Helmholtz decomposition is performed on the global EHFs to remove prominent nondynamic rotational wave-like structures that appear in these fluxes. The dynamic divergent EHFs are responsible for driving cross-frontal exchange and positive Baroclinic Conversion (BC) rates, suggesting a conversion of mean potential energy to eddy potential energy within the mixed layer. The results show that the model captures the same spatial patterns of EHFs and BC rates, but with relatively higher values in the midlatitudes than observations. The mixed layer geostrophic meridional eddy heat transport reaches maximums of 0.07 PW and 0.1 PW in the midlatitudes in the observations and climate model, respectively. The global integrated BC rate is 0.11 TW in the observations, which is similar to 30% weaker than the climate model (0.16 TW). A cross-spectral analysis further shows that the model has higher energy in low-frequency bands for periods greater than 10 months in the northern hemisphere western boundary currents, but can capture the major spectral peaks in EHFs that are seen in observations.

AB Within the current global climate, precedence has been set on achieving greater sustainable development within process industries. The ammonia process (BAU case) has been labelled as a significant greenhouse gas (GHG) producer-mainly due to high energy demand and CO(2)emissions. This places the process under substantial scrutiny in terms of its climate change impacts and thus, provides a strong case study for viable transition towards greater sustainable operations. Here we examine, for the first time, sustainable eco-park designs for the diversification of the ammonia industry utilizing industrial symbiosis. The network considers several carbon capture and utilization (CCU) applications as well as ammonia (NH3) integration to produce the following downstream products: NH3, urea, Urea Ammonium Nitrate (UAN), Melamine (Mel) and Methanol (MeOH). Our results demonstrate improved energy efficiency with the inclusion of MeOH while UAN decreases net energy demand. Economically, the incorporation of MeOH gave attractive returns on investment due to increased productivity. Insights into environmental sustainability, through the assessment of Planetary Boundaries (PBs), revealed high risk operations aligned to climate change and ocean acidification earth systems linked to BAU operations. These impacts improved considerably with the addition of MeOH, resulting in safe operations of the ammonia process, attributed to increased waste recovery. These results were further supported using Life Cycle Sustainability Assessments, highlighting the potential of the BAU + urea + UAN + Mel + MeOH eco-park design for enhanced sustainable development. Overall, the findings of our paper suggest that upcoming and existing ammonia facilities can exploit industrial symbiosis to achieve greater sustainability through diversification of process operations.

TI Motion and Mooring Load Responses of a Novel 12-MW Semi-Submersible

AB Due to the complexity of the integrated Floating Wind Turbine (FWT) system, obtaining reliable results necessitates extensive experiments. This paper conducts a comprehensive study on the motion performance and mooring load responses of a novel 12-MW semi-submersible FWT through model tests carried out in a wave basin. A multi-blade large-scale wind-generation system, equipped with a rectifier network, was enhanced and constructed to provide a dependable wind field. And a flexible tower was designed and fabricated, achieving an accurate simulation of the tower's stiffness characteristic and its impact on the overall dynamic response. The marine environmental conditions encompass various combinations of wind, waves, and currents. Rigorous calibration and identification tests were undertaken to validate the environmental conditions and the model system. The findings reveal that, under mild wave parameters, the mooring load is primarily influenced by the resonance response with platform motions, particularly surge resonance. The load effect of wind and current induces mean surge and pitch motions, while their damping effect reduces the standard deviation of responses, notably suppressing the pitch response peak at its natural motion frequency. Wave loads predominantly dictate the vibration range of motion responses. When the current velocity reaches a sufficient magnitude, the coupling effect between current and wave in the wave-frequency region significantly amplifies the mooring response. Notably, motions and mooring loads in the 60-deg and 90-deg directions surpass those in the 0-deg direction, with the maximum responses occurring at 60 deg.

AB The structural design of offshore wind turbines is based on the consideration of coupled dynamic phenomena. Wave loads cause the dynamic oscillation of the monopile, and the dynamic oscillation of the monopile affects the wave loads. The boundary conditions of the gravity-based foundation-monopile-turbine system are mostly affected by the flexural stiffness of the foundation plate, the elastic and creep behavior of the soil, and the inertia (translational and rotational) of the wind turbine mass. The design of the foundation should consider the dynamic response of the soil and the monopile, and the dynamic response of the soil and the monopile is affected by the design parameters of the foundation. The initial conditions of the system yield transient dynamic phenomena. A braking wave at t = 0 causes different dynamic response than the steady-state conditions due to a harmonic wave load. In the present work, an integrated analytical model simulating the above dynamic phenomena is proposed. With the aid of double integral transforms and generalized function properties, a solution of the corresponding differential equations for the monopile-soil-foundation system and the boundary and initial conditions is derived. A parametric study is carried out, and results of the effect of the design parameters and soil properties are presented and discussed.

AB The incorporation of sulfur (S) into the apatite structure and the partitioning of S between apatite and silicate melt (D-S(ap/m)) have been proposed to vary systematically as a function of prevailing redox conditions. In this study, we experimentally equilibrated apatite with mafic silicate melt at 1000 degrees C, 300 MPa and a range of oxygen fugacity (fO(2); log fO(2) [DFMQ] = -1, 0, +0.3, +1.2, and +3 where FMQ is the fayalite-magnetite-quartz mineral redox buffer) to explore the partitioning behavior of S, including different oxidation states of S, between apatite and silicate melt. The data reveal that D-S(ap/m) values increase systematically with increasing fO(2), from 0.02 +/- 0.01 at log fO(2) [DFMQ] of -1 to 3.20 +/- 0.19 at log fO(2) [DFMQ] of +3. The bulk S content (similar to 0.37 and similar to 0.28 wt.% S added) imparts a minor influence on D-S(ap/m) at reducing conditions.
   Micro X-ray absorption near edge structure (mu-XANES) spectroscopy at the S K-edge was used to measure, in situ, the oxidation states of S in experimentally crystallized apatite. The SXANES analyses reveal that with increasing fO(2), apatite progressively incorporates S6+ >> S2- > S4+ > S1+. The integrated S6+/Sigma S peak area ratios and centroid energies (eV) were determined for apatite crystals in apatite from experiments at all fO(2) conditions. The orientation effects occurring during S-XANES analyses of apatite were considered by merging spectra from multiple grains with random crystallographic orientation. The S-XANES data reveal that S6+/Sigma S peak area ratios and the centroid energies increase systematically with fO(2), demonstrating that the S6+/Sigma S ratio in apatite can be used as an oxybarometer.
   The results demonstrate that both the S6+/Sigma S and C-eV calibration methods are highly sensitive in the redox range of similar to FMQ to similar to FMQ + 1.2 at the conditions and compositions evaluated in this study. As a result, the S-in-apatite oxybarometer is particularly applicable to mafic systems such as mid ocean ridge basalts (MORB), relatively reduced ocean island basalts (OIB), and back-arc basin basalt (BABB). Owing to the ubiquity of apatite in magmatic and magmatic-hydrothermal systems, measuring the concentration and oxidations state(s) of S-in-apatite has the potential to serve as a powerful sulfo- and oxybarometer for a broad range of natural systems.

AB To meet UN Sustainable Development goals, a clean-energy transition with minimal ecological impact from its raw-material supply chain is essential. Polymetallic nodules lying unattached on the abyssal seafloor of the Pacific Ocean's Clarion Clipperton Zone contain four critical metals (nickel, cobalt, manganese, copper) in large quantities, and the International Seabed Authority may soon enact regulations to allow their commercial exploitation. There are complex global ecological implications of doing so. Nodule exploitation would damage abyssal habitats and may impact midwater-column organisms; but in the absence of nodule exploitation, terrestrial mining's environmental and social impacts would intensify. This paper adds to the growing systems-based literature on nodule collection by contributing a preliminary material flow analysis of global-average cradle-to-gate waste streams using either nodules or terrestrial sources as part of a preliminary life cycle assessment, as well as integrated risk assessments of those waste streams. System endpoints are battery precursors (nickel sulfate, cobalt sulfate, manganese sulfate), copper cathode, and a 40% or 75% manganese product. Overburden, tailings, and processing and refining wastes from terrestrial mining are compared to the nodule industry's anticipated offshore and onshore wastes, including sediment disrupted by nodule-collection machines. Robustness to offshore technology assumptions is tested using Monte Carlo simulation, while onshore mass-flow scenarios incorporate a "negligible-waste" flowsheet and high-waste flowsheets where manganese is not recovered. A billion-EV scenario incorporates the effects of declining terrestrial copper and nickel ore grades. Results imply that metal production from nodules may produce less waste of lower severities, caveated by uncertain impacts of disrupted sediment.

AB Cities are increasingly depending on energy-intensive water sources, such as distant rivers and the ocean, to meet their water demand. However, such expensive sources could be avoided using alternative local sources of water such as wastewater, rainwater, and stormwater. Many cities do not have robust accounts of those localized water resources, as estimating those resources requires comprehensive accounting in complex urban water systems. In this article, we investigate whether an urban metabolism evaluation framework built on the urban water mass balance can help analyze these resources, especially in a rapidly growing developing city. We first refined the water mass balance equation developed by Kenway and his colleagues in 2011 for a developing country context with the inclusion of some significant components such as system loss. Then, we applied the refined equation for the first time to Bangalore city in India, a developing country, for the year 2013-2014 as a real case example, which is a rare water mass balance analysis of its kind. The refined equation helped analyze Bangalore's urban water system. The total available wastewater, stormwater, and rainwater were 656 gigaliters (GL). The gap between water demand and supply could be met if 54% of this recycled potential were harnessed. Wastewater had enough potential (362 GL) to replace the whole centralized water supply from the Cauvery. A scenario analysis showed that the gap between water demand and supply in 2021 can be met if 60% of total recycled potential is utilized. This approach can be used to help other cities identify the potential of alternative water sources and support integrated water planning and monitoring water metabolic performance.

AB Over the past two decades, numerous ecosystem surveys and process studies have emerged to monitor and assess the large marine ecosystems of Alaska. Several regional collaborative integrated ecosystem research projects (IERPs) were conducted to gain understanding of fish population fluctuations in relation to the surrounding environment. The Gulf of Alaska (GOA) IERP is one example of such an effort. Products of this program include a suite of in situ observations from fully integrated ecosystem surveys, laboratory experiments of physical thresholds for fish condition, and high-resolution oceanographic, planktonic, and habitat distribution models. When coupled, the synthesis products of this program can be utilized to understand system connectivity and highlight the primary ecosystem drivers of the GOA. Much of this information was included in annual GOA ecosystem status reports through individual indicator contributions. However, assimilation of these data into single-species stock assessments has remained limited. We provide a clear and direct avenue for including the products of these IERPs through the new ecosystem and socioeconomic profile (ESP) framework that identifies mechanistic relationships and tests ecosystem linkages within the stock assessment process. We present a case study using a data synthesis of the five commercially and ecologically valuable focal species of the GOAIERP (sablefish, pollock, Pacific cod, arrowtooth flounder, and Pacific ocean perch). Information was organized along the categories of distribution, phenology, and condition by life history stage to develop life history narratives for each species. These narratives identified critical ecosystem processes that could impact survival of each species. We then used habitat distribution models, seasonal phenology, and energy allocation strategies to sequentially reduce two gridded temperature datasets to reflect the life experience of the stock. This method essentially aligns ecosystem information at a spatial and temporal scale relevant to a stock and creates informed indicators that could then be related to a stock assessment parameter of interest, such as recruitment. Informed temperature indicators differed in magnitude and variability when compared to non-informed indicators and demonstrating species and stage-specific thermal preferences. The difference between the informed indicators and the non informed indicators can also highlight thresholds and trends in habitat preference that could be further investigated with targeted process studies or laboratory experiments. The coordinated nature of the IERP allowed for the creation of these informed indicators that would not be possible with the results of any one process study. Both the stock-specific narratives and the informed indicators can be included into the ESPs for further monitoring and development. This integration ensures that the identified ecosystem linkages are evaluated concurrently with the stock assessment and ultimately transferred to fishery managers in an efficient and effective format for informing management decisions.

AB Recently, various Earth Observation Networks (EONs) have been designed, developed and launched by in-situ, on-site and off-site collected data from fixed and moving marine sensors and remote sensing (RS) satellite data. This information can significantly help a wide range of public and private end-users better understand the medium- and high-resolution numerical models for regional, national and global coverage. In this context, such EON core services' operational numerical data can be seen of the growing demand result for marine sustainability development of developing countries and the European Union (EU). In this case, marine platforms can offer a wide range of benefits to users of human communities in the same environment using meticulous analyses. Furthermore, marine platforms can contribute to a deeper discourse on the ocean, given the required regulations, technical and legal considerations and users to a common typology using clear scientific terminology. In this regard, firstly, the following six steps have been used to develop a better understanding of the essential data structure that is commensurate with the efficiency of the marine end-user's service: (1) steps and challenges of collecting data, (2) stakeholder engagement to identify, detect and assess the specific needs of end-users, (3) design, develop and launch the products offered to meet the specific needs of users, (4) achieve sustainable development in the continuous provision of these products to end-users, (5) identify future needs and challenges, and (6) online platform architecture style related to providing these products to end-users. Secondly, the innovation of the ODYSSEA (Operating a Network of Integrated Observatory Systems in the Mediterranean Sea) platform project has been evaluated and reviewed as a successful project on marine online platforms to better understand how marine online platforms are being used, designed, developed and launched. The ODYSSEA platform provides a system that bridges the gap between operational oceanographic capabilities and the need for information on marine conditions, including for the end-user community. The project aims to develop a fully integrated and cost-effective cross-platform, multi-platform network of observation and forecasting systems across the Mediterranean Sea.

AB Hydrological changes due to climate change will impact the sustainability of social-ecological systems (SES). It is essential to develop methodologies, capable of addressing economic as well as the environmental aspects, to take care of the water-associated system through improving the system adaptive capacity, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas. Through the application of the Post-Modern Portfolio Theory (PMPT), we propose a new approach to water allocation problem in the face of climate change, as a case of Lake Tashk-Bakhtegan basin, Southern Iran. The economic model based on PMPT is adapted for designing water allocation schemes to maximize local economic return, minimize its risk and minimize the Gini coefficient indicative of social inequities. The climatic variables were generated by three Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models. The temperature and precipitation will increase and decrease by about +2.4% and -10% on average in the future compared to those in the historical period, respectively. In order to identify hydrological and socio-economic implications of climate change in the basin, an integrated system dynamic model was developed. Finally, the decision space of equally effective solutions has been determined in the form of Pareto points at the efficient portfolio plane. The findings showed a decrease in the economic return (on average by 5.7% in the both RCPs) and the ratio of employment to unemployment (average 10% in most of sub-basin), owing to the reduction of water resources, especially in agriculture. Base on Portfolio results, the ratio of economic return to risk doubled and tripled in optimized condition compared to the normal condition in the future. The efficient plane of the portfolio can be used to allocate water to economic activities according to a risk-taking attitude of a decision-maker. Following the model results, services and industrial sectors would need to be developed in order to sustain local water resources with possible additional allocations for environmental requirements, with simultaneous improvement of economic return on water resources.

AB This study investigates impacts of a wave farm on waves, currents and coastal morphology adjacent to the wave farm, which is located in the Southwest of England (the Wave Hub). In this study, we focus on the interaction between waves and tides due to the presence of the wave farm and its effects on wave radiation stresses, bottom shear stresses and consequently on the sediment transport and the coast adjacent to the wave farm, using an integrated numerical modelling system. The modelling system consists of the near-shore wave model SWAN, the ocean circulation model ROMS and a sediment transport model for morphological evolution. The results show that tidal elevation and tidal currents can have a significant effect on waves and that tidal forcing and waves have a significant effect on bottom shear stresses. Waves can impact on the processes related to the bottom boundary layer and mixing intensity in the water column. The wave farm has an impact on the gradients of radiation shear stresses and bottom shear stresses that modify current speeds and wave heights, which in turn impact on the near-shore sediment transport and the resulting morphological changes. Bed load transport rates show a decrease when the wave farm is present, even during storm conditions. The results highlight the importance of the interactions between waves and tides when modelling coastal morphology with presence of wave energy devices.

AB In the ocean, nitrogen availability is an important control of primary production and influences the amount of energy flowing through food webs. Mesoscale eddies play important roles in modulating the spatial distributions of physical and biogeochemical properties in the Gulf of Mexico (GM), including the availability of nitrate + nitrite (NN). In this study, we explore an oceanographic station classification based on the integrated NN stock that we have named the "nitracentric classification" and a classification based on hydrographic variables that we call the Best Fit Variables (BFVs), such as the depth of the 20 degrees C isotherm and the depth of the 26 kg m(-3) isopycnal, to identify stations under the influence of mesoscale eddies. We analyzed hydrographic profiles of CTD data and the NN concentrations in discrete samples collected in June 2016 during the oceanographic campaign XIXIMI-5, which was conducted in the deep-water region of the GM. The best station separation was produced when the NN concentration was integrated between the surface and 200 m depth, which was supported by the station classification based on the BFVs. Our classification system produces a better separation between station groups when compared to other classifications that rely on the use of altimetric variables and hydrographic criteria that have been previously employed to study biogeochemical and physical processes in the GM. We obtained parameterizations that accurately predicted the NN profiles between 100-500 m of stations sampled under stratified conditions in two other XIXIMI cruises in the gulf, although the parameterization has to be adapted to obtain accurate predictions under winter mixing conditions. Our results can be used to predict nitrate stocks and profiles based on a single BFV value obtained from the existing hydrographic databases of the GM as well as from CTD data at the time of sampling. The analysis of the CLIVAR Section A22 in the Caribbean Sea indicates that the nitracentric and hydrographic classification methodology developed in this study can also be applied to other oligotrophic basins where mesoscale eddies play important roles in controlling the distributions of hydrographic and biogeochemical properties.

AB A model for tsunamis propagation is derived by coupling a weakly compressible liquid layer, standing for the ocean, to a viscoelastic solid layer of constant depth, representing the upper layer of the Earth. Below this layer, the Earth is assumed to be perfectly rigid. The resulting equations are averaged over the depth of the water layer for the liquid part and are integrated over the thickness of the solid layer for the solid part. The obtained system of equations is hyperbolic and admits an exact equation of energy conservation. The model is dispersive and includes an elastic branch, an acoustic branch and a gravity branch. The elasticity of the solid layer entails: (1) a reverse dispersion effect i.e. the phase velocity of the gravity branch decreases for small wave numbers if the wave number decreases; (2) an arrival time delay of the tsunami and (3) a leading negative phase i.e. a negative water elevation before the arrival of the main wave. All these effects are absent if the sea floor is assumed to be perfectly rigid. The arrival time delay due to elasticity comes in addition to the delay due to seawater compressibility. These effects are in agreement with previous works on tsunamis propagation. This preliminary model is a promising alternative approach for tsunamis propagation due to its ability to capture the main physical effects with a relatively simple mathematical structure of equations, which is easy to solve numerically.(c) 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Offshore Wind (OW) speed assessment is a key aspect for the development of new wind farms at sea. Satellites can be used to globally obtain ocean and sea distribution, compensating limited in-situ measurements. In this study, a new methodology to estimate the wind's speed potential is here proposed. Preliminary, Sentinel-1 (S-1) images have been analyzed by means of the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) software, extrapolating wind speed data for each cell pixel size of a testing area. Then GIS (Geographic Information System) software has been used to map wind data and find the best pixel location comparing these data with in-situ data. Furthermore, wind speed has been analyzed using the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset for areas within 11 km and 40 km from the Lillgrund OW farm in the Baltic Sea to better understand wind regimes. Finally, wind speed parameters obtained by S-1 in Sea Surface Water (SSW) with the 10 m standard high have been compared with wind speed recorded by Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems of two turbine using wind profile formula. Obtained results show the comparison accuracy of wind speed assessment for each center of the pixels by S-1 satellite images and in-situ (SCADA) measurements. Data actually depends on the distance between the selected center pixel and the location of the turbines. The obtained wind speed differences (0.26 m/s -RMSE = 1.38 and 0.92 m/s -RMSE = 1.82) pinpointed the direct effect of the distance between the selected pixel center and the in-situ measurements location in the S-1 imagery for wind speed potential assessment. Obtained results proved an improvement of the OW assessment accuracy using multiple satellite observations, demonstrating that SAR wind maps can support OW speed sites assessment by introducing observations in different phases of an OW farm project.

AB The utilization of oscillating water column (OWC) converters with existing hydraulic/coastal structures has emerged as a crucial approach for the development of economically viable and environmentally sustainable green power generation devices. Integrating OWC converters into offshore wind turbine (OWT) monopiles is a promising solution in wind power industrialization. This paper presents an experimental investigation of the flow characteristics of an OWT-OWC system under regular wave conditions, focusing on the evolution of vortex structures. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) is employed to measure the flow field surrounding the OWC converter under different wave heights and wave period conditions. Based on the measured velocity field data, the evolution of vortices is examined using the Q-criterion. The results indicate that the wave period significantly affects the flow patterns. Specifically, an increase in wave period enhances the three-dimensional nature of the flow field. The vortices outside the OWC chamber are observed to connect and form a three-dimensional vortex ring, hindering efficient wave energy conversion. Conversely, the variation in wave height exhibits limited impact on the flow field evolution. However, as the wave height increases, the vortex strength and asymmetry experience a significant rise, making it difficult to form a stable three-dimensional vortex ring. Moreover, based on optimal geometric design considerations, it is recommended to increase the lateral angle and height of the sidewall openings to prevent vortex ring formation and minimize obstructions, while ensuring the structural safety of the OWT.

AB Aim Latitudinal gradients of species richness represent Earth's first-order biodiversity pattern. Most species groups display a near-monotonic decline in richness from the equator to the poles, yet there exists little mechanistic theory to derive such patterns from first principles. Here we integrate two key advances - neutral theory and the metabolic theory of ecology - to reconstruct global species richness gradients and test underlying causes.
   Location Simulated global meta-community.
   Methods We constructed a spatially explicit global meta-community with constant per capita rates of disturbance, speciation and dispersal. No gradient emerged in this neutral base model. Focusing on the oceans as a model system, we added a water temperature gradient of 0-30 degrees C that independently affected rates of community turnover and speciation based on established metabolic scaling laws. We also added a gradient in habitat area that roughly parallels the observed decrease in ocean area from tropical to polar waters.
   Results Thermal effects on the community turnover rate caused a transient latitudinal gradient that ultimately disappeared. Thermal effects on speciation produced a dynamically stable but relatively weak gradient. Increasing habitat area towards the equator in combination with thermal effects on speciation rate produced a more realistic gradient that emerged from the combined effects of species-area and species-energy theory.
   Main conclusions This reasonably simple model provides a platform to explore support for processes underpinning large-scale biodiversity gradients, and the ability of prominent ecological theories, independently or in combination, to capture them.

AB Integrating behavior and physiology is critical to formulating new hypotheses on the evolution of animal life-history strategies. Migratory capital breeders acquire most of the energy they need to sustain migration, gestation, and lactation before parturition. Therefore, when predicting the impact of environmental variation on such species, a mechanistic understanding of the physiology of their migratory behavior is required. Using baleen whales as a model system, we developed a dynamic state variable model that captures the interplay among behavioral decisions, energy, reproductive needs, and the environment. We applied the framework to blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) in the eastern North Pacific Ocean and explored the effects of environmental and anthropogenic perturbations on female reproductive success. We demonstrate the emergence of migration to track prey resources, enabling us to quantify the trade-offs among capital breeding, body condition, and metabolic expenses. We predict that periodic climatic oscillations affect reproductive success less than unprecedented environmental changes do. The effect of localized, acute anthropogenic impacts depended on whales' behavioral response to the disturbance; chronic, but weaker, disturbances had little effect on reproductive success. Because we link behavior and vital rates by modeling individuals' energetic budgets, we provide a general framework to investigate the ecology of migration and assess the population consequences of disturbance, while identifying critical knowledge gaps.

AB Conserving and using the oceans, seas, and marine resources sustainably is a high-level management goal encouraged by the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development and endorsed by most national policies. Estuaries are complex Social-Ecological Systems (SES) impacted by pressures from multi-sectoral activities. In these contexts, a holistic management approach, such as Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM), is essential to prevent the loss of ecosystem services. The Guadalquivir estuary-Gulf of Cadiz (Ge-GoC) is an intricate SES that faces pressures from numerous sectoral activities, including fishing, agriculture, shipping, aquaculture, and mining. The cumulative effects of these pressures (such as juvenile exploitation, eutrophication, pollution, riverbank erosion, and the introduction of alien species) could potentially drive the SES toward an ecological regime shift and deplete current ecosystem services such as its nursery role. Although there is a good understanding of the Ge-GoC ecosystem dynamics, no efforts have been made to consider and incorporate the human dimension, which is essential for successful EBM implementation. Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a tool from social sciences that characterizes the relationships among stakeholders within a given social setting. In an effort to frame the Ge-GoC social system, the first SNA was conducted, involving interviews with 55 stakeholders representing 11 sectors. The SNA identified key stakeholders from the government, fishing, shipping, surveillance, local city councils energy and NGO sectors due to their high centrality. While the shipping and energy sectors displayed significant influence in estuary management, they demonstrated limited interest and, in some cases, disagreement with the overall SES objectives, in contrast to the NGO and surveillance sectors. The primary management goals identified by stakeholders include reducing water pollution, controlling invasive species, combating drug trafficking, and addressing illegal fishing. However, the majority of stakeholders expressed reluctance regarding the goal of shipping optimization. The information extracted through SNA provides a valuable knowledge base for creating participatory processes that can guide complex SES toward EBM.

AB Radiative convective equilibrium has been applied in past studies to various models given its simplicity and analogy to the tropical climate. At convection-permitting resolution, the focus has been on the organization of convection that appears when using fixed sea surface temperature (SST). Here the SST is allowed to freely respond to the surface energy. The goals are to examine and understand the resulting transient behavior, equilibrium state, and perturbations thereof, as well as to compare these results to a simulation integrated with parameterized cloud and convection. Analysis shows that the coupling between the SST and the net surface energy acts to delay the onset of self-aggregation and may prevent it, in our case, for a slab ocean of less than 1 m. This is so because SST gradients tend to oppose the shallow low-level circulation that is associated with the self-aggregation of convection. Furthermore, the occurrence of self-aggregation is found to be necessary for reaching an equilibrium state and avoiding a greenhouse-like climate. In analogy to the present climate, the self-aggregation generates the dry and clear subtropics that allow the system to efficiently cool. In contrast, strong shortwave cloud radiative effects, much stronger than at convection-permitting resolution, prevent the simulation with parameterized cloud and convection to fall into a greenhouse state. The convection-permitting simulations also suggest that cloud feedbacks, as arising when perturbing the equilibrium state, may be very different, and in our case less negative, than what emerges from general circulation models.

AB The assimilation of Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) brightness temperature (T-B) data in numerical weather prediction systems influences the state of the soil, which in turn affects the exchange of energy and water fluxes between the soil and the near-surface atmosphere, with potential implications for the prediction of atmospheric variables. In this paper, the impact of assimilating SMOS T-B alone or in combination with screen-level observations and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) soil moisture retrievals is assessed. Independent quality controlled insitu soil moisture observations belonging to several networks included in the International Soil Moisture Network, were used to validate the quality of both the new soil moisture analyses and the skill to predict soil moisture up to 5 days ahead. The impact on atmospheric variables is indirect and was evaluated through computation of the forecast skill at different lead times. The analysis period was selected to be around the boreal summer, a period of the year when evaporatranspiration fluxes are stronger, and when it is therefore expected that the assimilation of remote-sensing data provides the largest impact on the state of the soil. The results show that the soil moisture state benefits from the direct assimilation of SMOS T-B, especially in better representing the temporal variations of soil moisture. The skill of atmospheric variables is mainly driven by the screen-level observations. Despite the clear benefits to the soil state, remote-sensing data need to be used with screen-level variables to add value to the state of the atmosphere, pointing to inconsistencies in the physical coupling between the land and near-surface components of the ECMWF Earth system.

AB The 1997 New Year's flood event was the most costly in California's history. This compound extreme event was driven by a category 5 atmospheric river that led to widespread snowmelt. Extreme precipitation, snowmelt, and saturated soils produced heavy runoff causing widespread inundation in the Sacramento Valley. This study recreates the 1997 flood using the Regionally Refined Mesh capabilities of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (RRM-E3SM) under prescribed ocean conditions. Understanding the processes causing extreme events informs practical efforts to anticipate and prepare for such events in the future, and also provides a rich context to evaluate model skill in representing extremes. Three California-focused RRM grids, with horizontal resolution refinement of 14 km down to 3.5 km, and six forecast lead times, 28 December 1996 at 00Z through 30 December 1996 at 12Z, are assessed for their ability to recreate the 1997 flood. Planetary to synoptic scale atmospheric circulations and integrated vapor transport are weakly influenced by horizontal resolution refinement over California. Topography and mesoscale circulations, such as the Sierra barrier jet, are better represented at finer horizontal resolutions resulting in better estimates of storm total precipitation and storm duration snowpack changes. Traditional time-series and causal analysis frameworks are used to examine runoff sensitivities state-wide and above major reservoirs. These frameworks show that horizontal resolution plays a more prominent role in shaping reservoir inflows, namely the magnitude and time-series shape, than forecast lead time, 2-to-4 days prior to the 1997 flood onset.

AB Fire danger poses a pressing threat to ecosystems and societies worldwide. Adequate preparation and forewarning can help reduce these threats, but these rely on accurate prediction of extreme fire danger. With the knowledge that climatic conditions contribute heavily to overall fire danger, this study evaluates the skill with which episodes of extreme fire danger in Australia can be predicted from the activity of large-scale climate driver patterns. An extremal dependence index for extreme events is used to depict the historical predictive skill of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's subseasonal climate prediction system in replicating known relationships between the probability of top-decile fire danger and climate driver states at a lead time of 2-3 weeks. Results demonstrate that the El Nino Southern Oscillation, Southern Annular Mode, persistent modes of atmospheric blocking, Indian Ocean Dipole and Madden-Julian Oscillation are all key for contributing to predictability of fire danger forecasts in different regions during critical fire danger periods. Northwest Australia is found to be particularly predictable, with the highest mean index differences (>0.50) when certain climate drivers are active, compared with the climatological index mean. This integrated approach offers a valuable resource for decision-making in fire-prone regions, providing greater confidence to users relying on fire danger outlooks for key management decisions, such as those involved in the sectors of national park and forest estate management, agriculture, emergency services, health and energy. Furthermore, the results highlight strengths and weaknesses in both the Australian Fire Danger Rating System and the operational climate model, contributing additional information for improving and refining future iterations of these systems.

AB In this paper, we find the optimal precursors which can cause double-gyre regime transitions based on conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation (CNOP) method with Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). Firstly, we simulate the multiple-equilibria regimes of double-gyre circulation under different viscosity coefficient and obtain the bifurcation diagram, then choose two equilibrium states (called jet-up state and jet-down state) as reference states respectively, propose Principal Component Analysis-based Simulated Annealing (PCASA) algorithm to solve CNOP-type initial perturbations which can induce double-gyre regime transitions between jet-up state and jet-down state. PCASA algorithm is an adjoint-free method which searches optimal solution randomly in the whole solution space. In addition, we investigate CNOP-type initial perturbations how to evolve with time. The results show: (1) the CNOP-type perturbations present a two-cell structure, and gradually evolves into a three-cell structure at predictive time; (2) by superimposing CNOP-type perturbations on the jet-up state and integrating ROMS, double-gyre circulation transfers from jet-up state to jet-down state, and vice versa, and random initial perturbations don't cause the transitions, which means CNOP-type perturbations are the optimal precursors of double-gyre regime transitions; (3) by analyzing the transition process of double-gyre regime transitions, we find that CNOP-type initial perturbations obtain energy from the background state through both barotropic and baroclinic instabilities, and barotropic instability contributes more significantly to the fast-growth of the perturbations. The optimal precursors and the dynamic mechanism of double-gyre regime transitions revealed in this paper have an important significance to enhance the predictability of double-gyre circulation.

AB Despite the complexity of the global ocean system, numerous attempts have been made to scale the strength of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC), principally in the North Atlantic, with large-scale, basin-wide hydrographic properties. In particular, various approaches to scaling the MOC with meridional density gradients have been proposed, but the success of these has only been demonstrated under limited conditions. Here we present a scaling relationship linking overturning to twice vertically-integrated meridional density gradients via the hydrostatic equation and a "rotated" form of the geostrophic equation. This provides a meridional overturning streamfunction as a function of depth for each basin. Using a series of periodically forced experiments in a global, coarse resolution configuration of the general circulation model NEMO, we explore the timescales over which this scaling is temporally valid. We find that the scaling holds well in the upper Atlantic cell (at 1000 m) for multi-decadal (and longer) timescales, accurately reconstructing the relative magnitude of the response for different frequencies and explaining over 85 % of overturning variance on timescales of 64-2048 years. Despite the highly nonlinear response of the Antarctic cell in the abyssal Atlantic, between 76 and 94 % of the observed variability at 4000 m is reconstructed on timescales of 32 years (and longer). The scaling law is also applied in the Indo-Pacific. This analysis is extended to a higher resolution, stochastically forced simulation for which correlations of between 0.79 and 0.99 are obtained with upper Atlantic MOC variability on timescales > 25 years. These results indicate that meridional density gradients and overturning are linked via meridional pressure gradients, and that both the strength and structure of the MOC can be reconstructed from hydrography on multi-decadal and longer timescales provided that the link is made in this way.

AB Satellite-derived shoreline observations combined with dynamic shoreline models enable fine-scale predictions of coastal change across large spatiotemporal scales. Here, we present a satellite-data-assimilated, "littoral-cell"-based, ensemble Kalman-filter shoreline model to predict coastal change and uncertainty due to waves, sea-level rise (SLR), and other natural and anthropogenic processes. We apply the developed ensemble model to the entire California coastline (approximately 1,760 km), much of which is sparsely monitored with traditional survey methods (e.g., Lidar/GPS). Water-level-corrected, satellite-derived shoreline observations (obtained from the CoastSat toolbox) offer a nearly unbiased representation of in situ surveyed shorelines (e.g., mean sea-level elevation contours) at Ocean Beach, San Francisco. We demonstrate that model calibration with satellite observations during a 20-year hindcast period (1995-2015) provides nearly equivalent model forecast accuracy during a validation period (2015-2020) compared to model calibration with monthly in situ observations at Ocean Beach. When comparing model-predicted shoreline positions to satellite-derived observations, the model achieves an accuracy of <10 m RMSE for nearly half of the entire California coastline for the validation period. The calibrated/validated model is then applied for multi-decadal simulations of shoreline change due to projected wave and sea-level conditions, while holding the model parameters fixed. By 2100, the model estimates that 24%-75% of California's beaches may become completely eroded due to SLR scenarios of 1.0-3.0 m, respectively. The satellite-data-assimilated modeling system presented here is generally applicable to a variety of coastal settings around the world owing to the global coverage of satellite imagery.

AB Two spectacular cliff lines occur along Australia's south and west coasts: the Great Southern Scarp (new name) and the Zuytdorp Cliffs. Detailed measurements of their length show that they are exceptionally long and unusually continuous. The Great Southern Scarp is the southern edge of the Nullarbor Plain's Bunda Plateau; it is cut into shallow marine sediments and extends for 820 km. Once a continuous sea-cliff, local uplift has isolated two sections from the ocean, so it now comprises the Bunda Cliffs (210 km of coastal cliff, 180 km of which is uninterrupted cliff line), Hampton Range (inland; 300 km), Baxter Cliffs (160 km of coastal cliff) and Wylie Scarp (inland; 160 km). The Zuytdorp Cliffs are coastal cliffs cut into eolianite, and extend for 210 km with an uninterrupted section of 120 km. The length of the Great Southern Scarp and the Zuytdorp Cliffs results from an unusual combination of circumstances. They are both composed of poorly jointed, relatively homogenous biogenic calcarenites, presented to high-energy ocean waves by regional uplift. The carbonates are sufficiently well cemented to maintain a steep vertical cliff face, but susceptible to disintegration under direct wave attack. Cliff retreat has been fairly uniform because of the broad spatial scale of both lithology and erosion. The arid climate, absence of nearby non-karstic catchments and karstic nature of the cliffs' hinterlands has discouraged integrated drainage development, so no significant fluvial systems dissect the cliffs; this is a key factor in cliff edge preservation. In the case of the Great Southern Scarp, these processes have formed the longest continuous cliff line in Australia and probably the world. Referenced against criteria from Australia's National Heritage List, the cliffs have potentially international/national levels of significance for the rarity of their scale, their demonstration of landscape evolution, and their spectacular beauty.

AB We introduce BinPo, an open-source Python code to compute electronic properties of two-dimensional electron systems. A bulk tight binding Hamiltonian is constructed from relativistic density functional theory calculations represented in the basis of maximally localized Wannier functions. BinPo has a Schrodinger-Poisson solver, integrating an electric field-dependent relative permittivity to obtain self -consistently the confining electrostatic potential energy term in the derived tight binding slab system. The band structure, energy slices, and other properties, along with different projections and orientations can be computed. High resolution and publishable figures of the simulations can be generated. In BinPo, priority has been given to ease-of-use, efficiency, readability and modularity, therefore becoming suitable to produce reliable electronic structures simulations at low computational cost. Along with the code itself, we provide files from first-principles calculations for some materials, instructions of use, and detailed examples of its wide range of capabilities. The code was developed with a focus on the ABO(3) perovskite structure-based systems, such as SrTiO3 and KTaO3, because of their increasing impact in the materials community. Some features, such as the projection onto orbital states, are restricted to calculations using the relevant t(2g) orbitals for this family of materials, yet it is possible to include more elements in the basis for the band structure determination of other systems. The use of a relativistic approach allows for the inspection of the role of spin-orbit coupling and the resulting Rashba effect on the systems. We detail the approaches used in the code, so that it can be further exploited and adapted to other problems, such as adding new materials and functionalities which can strength the initial code scopes.Program summaryProgram title: BinPoCPC Library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /zk4xy7vfy4 .1Developer's repository link: https://github .com /emanuelm33 /BinPoCode Ocean capsule: https://codeocean .com /capsule /0987578Licensing provisions: GPLv3Programming language: PythonExternal routines/libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, ASE.Nature of problem: Compute the band structure and other electronic properties in two-dimensional electron systems.Solution method: Construction of a slab Hamiltonian from one built using a basis of maximally localized Wannier functions.

AB It is widely known from energy balances that global oceans play a fundamental role in atmospheric seasonal anomalies via coupling mechanisms. However, numerical weather prediction models still have limitations in long-term forecasting due to their nonlinear sensitivity to initial deep oceanic conditions. As the Mediterranean climate has highly unpredictable seasonal variability, we designed a complementary method by supposing that 1) delayed teleconnection patterns provide information about ocean-atmosphere coupling on subseasonal time scales through the lens of 2) partially predictable quasi-periodic oscillations since 3) forecast signals can be extracted by smoothing noise in a continuous leadtime horizon. To validate these hypotheses, the subseasonal predictability of temperature and precipitation was analyzed at 11 reference stations in the Mediterranean area in the 1993-2021 period. The novel method, presented here, consists of combining lag-correlated teleconnections (15 indices) with self-predictability techniques of residual quasi-oscillation based on wavelet (cyclic) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) (linear) analyses. The prediction skill of this teleconnection-wavelet-ARIMA (TeWA) combination was cross-validated and compared to that of the ECMWF's Seasonal Forecast System 5 (SEAS5)-ECMWF model (3 months ahead). Results show that the proposed TeWA approach improves the predictability of first-month temperature and precipitation anomalies by 50%-70% compared with the forecast of SEAS5. On a moving-averaged daily scale, the optimum prediction window is 30 days for temperature and 16 days for precipitation. The predictable ranges are consistent with atmospheric bridges in teleconnection patterns [e.g., Upper-Level Mediterranean Oscillation (ULMO)] and are reflected by spatial correlation with sea surface temperature (SST). Our results suggest that combinations of the TeWA approach and numerical models could boost new research lines in subseasonalto-seasonal forecasting.

AB Geographic isolation, a relatively low species richness and high endemism make oceanic islands excellent natural laboratories for ecological and evolutionary studies. Here we used Baited Remote Underwater stereo-Video systems (stereo-BRUVS) to investigate the taxonomic, trophic and size structures of fish assemblages from pelagic and mesophotic reef ecosystems in the smallest archipelago of the equatorial Atlantic Ocean, the Saint Peter and Saint Paul's Archipelago (SPSPA). The occurrence of steep reef walls favors studies on the ecological connections between pelagic and reef ecosystems. We performed five pelagic stereo-BRUVS deployments and fourteen benthic stereo-BRUVS deployments, totaling 1440 min of footage. We recorded 14 species from eight families in the pelagic ecosystem, with Carangidae and Balistidae as the most diverse families. The most abundant species were Elagatis bipinnulata (Quoy and Gaimard, 1825), Melichthys niger (Bloch, 1786), and Caranx crysos (Mitchill, 1815), which together accounted for over 75% of the total relative abundance. The carnivores were the most diverse and abundant trophic group. On the mesophotic reefs, 41 taxa were recorded, with carnivores and planktivores being the most diverse, whereas omnivores were the most abundant. Here, the most abundant species were M. niger, Azurina multileneata, Chromis vanbebberae, Seriola rivoliana, Caranx lugubris and Stegastes sanctipauli. Nine species were recorded in both ecosystems, with Melichthys niger, Caranx lugubris and S. rivoliana being the main species linking them (i.e., occurring in both). These species are known to forage in both pelagic and mesophotic reef ecosystems, and thus represent potential ecological links between them. Such links combined with the endangered status of some species, suggest the need for an integrated management strategy in this remote archipelago.

AB Information on spectral wave characteristics is an essential prerequisite for ocean engineering-related activities and also to understand the complex wave environment at any given location. To the best of our knowledge, there are no comprehensive studies attempted so far to study the wave spectral characteristics over the head Bay of Bengal, a low-lying deltaic environment. The present study is an attempt to describe the spectral characteristics of wave evolution across different locations over this deltaic region based on numerical simulations. Therefore, it implements a multi-scale nested modeling approach using two state-of-art wave models, WAM and SWAN, and forced with ERA-Interim winds spanning the year of 2016. Model-computed integrated wave parameters are validated against wave rider buoy data as well as remotely sensed SARAL/AltiKa and merged altimeter data. Analysis of the monthly averaged one-dimensional spectrum reveals a single peak during the southwest monsoon and existence of double peaks from November to January, and occasionally up to March. Variance energy density undergoes inter-seasonal variation and attains its maxima during the month of July. Transformation of swell wave energy as a function of depth is found to be mostly associated with physical processes such as wave-bottom interaction and attenuation by opposing winds during the northeast (NE) monsoon. Fetch restriction for the evolution of wind seas (from the NE), modification in wind shear stress by opposing swells, and bottom effects remarkably contribute to the reduction in wind sea energy at shallow water depths. This study indicates that the influence of swells is higher along the eastern side of the basin as compared to the western side, and marginally higher variance is also observed over the east except during February-April. The two-dimensional wave spectra exhibit differential wave systems approaching from various directions attributed to a reflected swell system from the south-southeast throughout the year, southwest swells, reversing wind seas following local winds, and reflected wind seas from the land boundary.

AB Despite advancements in direct sensing technologies, accurately capturing complex wave-structure interactions remain a significant challenge in ship and ocean engineering. Ensuring the safety and reliability of floating structures requires precise monitoring of dynamic water interactions, particularly in extreme sea conditions. Recent developments in computer vision and artificial intelligence have enabled advanced image-based sensing techniques that complement traditional measurement methods. This study investigates the application of Computerized Video Analysis (CVA) for water surface tracking in maritime experimental tests, marking the first exploration of digitalized experimental video analysis at the Australian Maritime College (AMC). The objective is to integrate CVA into laboratory data acquisition systems, enhancing the accuracy and robustness of wave interaction measurements. A novel algorithm was developed to track water surfaces near floating structures, with its effectiveness assessed through a Wave Energy Converter (WEC) experiment. The method successfully captured wave runup interactions with the hull form, operating alongside traditional sensors to evaluate spectral responses at a wave height of 0.4 m. Moreover, its application in irregular wave conditions demonstrated the algorithm's capability to reliably detect the waterline across varying wave heights and periods. The findings highlight CVA as a reliable and scalable approach for improving safety assessments in maritime structures. Beyond controlled laboratory environments, this method holds potential for real-world applications in offshore wind turbines, floating platforms, and ship stability monitoring, contributing to enhanced structural reliability under operational and extreme sea states.

AB Ship motion planning constitutes the most critical part in the autonomous navigation systems of marine autonomous surface ships (MASS). Weather and ocean conditions can significantly affect their navigation, but there are relatively few studies on the influence of wind and current on motion planning. This study investigates the motion planning problem for USV, wherein the goal is to obtain an optimal path under the interference of the navigation environment (wind and current), and control the USV in order to avoid obstacles and arrive at its destination without collision. In this process, the influences of search efficiency, navigation safety and energy consumption on motion planning are taken into consideration. Firstly, the navigation environment is constructed by integrating information, including the electronic navigational chart, wind and current field. Based on the environmental interference factors, the three-degree-of-freedom kinematic model of USVs is created, and the multi-objective optimization and complex constraints are reasonably expressed to establish the corresponding optimization model. A multi-objective optimization algorithm based on HA* is proposed after considering the constraints of motion and dynamic and optimization objectives. Simulation verifies the effectiveness of the algorithm, where an efficient, safe and economical path is obtained and is more in line with the needs of practical application.</p>

ID NANOGENERATOR
AB In recent years, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have attracted increasing attention in sensing applications. Numerous studies have confirmed that TENG can be used as a sensor to monitor various environmental parameters. However, these works often concentrate solely on a single parameter. Here, we report a highly sensitive multiparameter triboelectric wave sensor (MTWS), comprising a sliding-mode TENG incorporated into flexible magnet layers, a foam ball buoy, and a connecting bar constrained within a linear bearing. A theoretical model, coupled with magnetic prestress, is formulated to predict the electro-mechano behavior of the sensor in response to actual test waves. The experimental results indicate that external magnetic prestress enhances sensor sensitivity, and the predicted wave height aligns well with the commercial sensor results. Based on the proficient energy transmutation advantage of sliding-mode TENG, a remarkable sensitivity of 33.627 mu A/(m/s) and a minimal resolution of 0.00137 m/s are reached in wave velocity monitoring. Importantly, the MTWS shows the ability to monitor wave height, wave speed, and wave period simultaneously. Our research establishes the substantial potential of MTWS as a multifaceted wave-sensing apparatus, rendering it highly adaptable for integration within marine wave surveillance systems.

AB The Dynamics of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (DYNAMO) field campaign, conducted over the Indian Ocean from October 2011 to March 2012, was designed to study the initiation of the Madden Julian oscillation (WO). Two prominent MJOs occurred in the experimental domain during the special observing period in October and November. Data from a northern and a southern sounding array (NSA and SSA, respectively) have been used to investigate the apparent heat sources and sinks (Q(1) and Q(2)) and radiative heating rates Q(R) throughout the life cycles of the two MJO events. The MJO signal was far stronger in the NSA than the SSA. Time series of Q(1), Q(2), and the vertical eddy flux of moist static energy reveal an evolution of cloud systems for both MJOs consistent with prior studies: shallow, nonprecipitating cumulus during the suppressed phase, followed by cumulus congestus, then deep convection during the active phase, and finally stratiform precipitation. However, the duration of these phases was shorter for the November MJO than for the October event. The profiles of Q(1) and Q(2) for the two arrays indicate a greater stratiform rain fraction for the NSA than the SSA a finding supported by TRMM measurements. Surface rainfall rates and net tropospheric QR determined as residuals from the budgets show good agreement with satellite-based estimates. The cloud radiative forcing was approximately 20% of the column-integrated convective heating and of the same amplitude as the normalized gross moist stability, leaving open the possibility of radiative convective instability for the two MJOs.

AB Mayotte Island is characterized by a vast coral reef-lagoon complex comprising significant mangrove development and numerous pocket beaches nested between volcanic headlands. Since 2005, field experiments involving topographic surveys, observations and hydrodynamic measurements have been coupled with the analysis of aerial photographs (1950-2016) in order to improve understanding of the morphodynamic interactions between mangroves, beaches and the coral reefs. The results, integrated in a coastal observatory of Mayotte Island, highlight a remarkably variable mangrove system subject to advance or stability in the north and east of the island but exhibiting a clearly regressive pattern along the southern and western shores. This variability largely reflects the impact of humans on mangrove stability. The hydrodynamic data acquired during the field experiments clearly bring out the spatial and temporal variations in wave patterns involved in these differences. These data also shed light on the short-term morphodynamics of small pocket beaches associated with these mangroves. Patterns of beach morphological change driven by residual wave energy following reef attenuation are strongly affected by the importance of beach embayment. These patterns affect, in turn, mangrove resilience, which is weak on the more exposed south and west coasts of the island, where all the mangrove stands fronting the lagoon have retreated, compared to the more stable stands on the north coast. These results highlight the complex time and space-varying morphodynamic interactions involved in a reef shoreline environment, and how these can also reflect the consequences of humans on mangrove stability. The results should, within the framework of the Mayotte coastal observatory, contribute to the management and conservation of the coast.

AB Under climate change, model ensembles suggest that declines in phytoplankton biomass amplify into greater reductions at higher trophic levels, with serious implications for fisheries and carbon storage. However, the extent and mechanisms of this trophic amplification vary greatly among models, and validation is problematic. In situ size spectra offer a novel alternative, comparing biomass of small and larger organisms to quantify the net efficiency of energy transfer through natural food webs that are already challenged with multiple climate change stressors. Our global compilation of pelagic size spectrum slopes supports trophic amplification empirically, independently from model simulations. Thus, even a modest (16%) decline in phytoplankton this century would magnify into a 38% decline in supportable biomass of fish within the intensively-fished mid-latitude ocean. We also show that this amplification stems not from thermal controls on consumers, but mainly from temperature or nutrient controls that structure the phytoplankton baseline of the food web. The lack of evidence for direct thermal effects on size structure contrasts with most current thinking, based often on more acute stress experiments or shorter-timescale responses. Our synthesis of size spectra integrates these short-term dynamics, revealing the net efficiency of food webs acclimating and adapting to climatic stressors.
   Using a global synthesis of size spectra data from pelagic food webs, this study finds that size structure is not driven by temperature as often suggested, but by the nutrient status of the system. This means that modest phytoplankton declines projected for key fishing grounds at mid-latitudes will amplify into substantial reductions in the supportable biomass of fish.

ID IMPACT
AB According to the Ministry of Energy, more than 93% of Morocco's energy resources are imported. In 2008, the Moroccan Government has developed the National Energy Strategy, which includes the Moroccan Integrated Wind Energy Program. Morocco is rich in wind energy resources. Morocco launched the renewable energy development program, which aims to achieve a total installed capacity 2000 MW from wind power by 2020. The aim of this study is to determine the characteristics of the distribution of wind power density in Morocco in 2021-2050 and determine the areas with favorable conditions for the development of wind energy in the near future. The article presents the calculation results of wind power density for the period 20212050 at 50 m height. As a base value of the wind speed was used value of wind speed calculated by the ensemble of the regional climate models (R.M) of the CORDEX-Africa project. The RCM modeling was carried out for the region of Africa, in a rectangular coordinate system with a spatial resolution of similar to 44 km. Model calculation was performed taking into account the greenhouse gas concentration trajectory of RCP 4.5. Eleven climate models were used for the calculation. The results of the regional climate modeling of the CORDEX-Africa project showed that in Morocco in 2021-2050, in terms of wind power density at 50 m height, the fair and good wind power class would be the Atlantic coast area between Cape Beddouza and Cape Ghir, where wind power farms in Jbel Lahdid, Essaouira, are located. The richest wind resources in the coming decades are projected on the Atlantic coast to the south of the city of Tarfaya, where the Akhfenir, Tiskrad, and Boujdour wind power farms are located. The Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region, where the Tanger and Koudia wind farms are located, will be characterized by fair wind power class during the period from February to April. The coast of the Atlantic Ocean, where the Jbel Lahdid, Essaouira, wind farms are located, will have a good and above wind power class over the period from April to September, and the coastal areas of the Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra region can be described by the RCM as a good and above wind power class throughout the year.

AB Maritime transport carries over 80% of global trade by volume and remains the most energy-efficient mode for long-distance goods movement. However, the sector contributes approximately 3% of global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, a share that could rise to 17% by 2050 without effective regulation. In response, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has introduced initial and short-term measures to enhance energy efficiency and reduce emissions. In 2023, IMO Strategy expanded on these efforts with medium-term measures, including Market-Based Mechanisms (MBMs) such as a GHG levy, a feebate system, and fuel intensity regulations combined with carbon pricing. This study evaluates the economic and environmental impacts of these measures using an integrated computational simulation model that combines Ocean Engineering and Economics. Our results indicate that all proposed measures support the IMO's intermediate emission reduction targets through 2035, cutting absolute emissions by more than 50%. However, economic impacts vary significantly across regions, with most of Africa, Asia, and South America experiencing the greatest adverse effects on GDP and trade. Among the measures, the GHG levy exerts the strongest pressure on economic activity and food prices, while a revised fuel intensity mechanism imposes lower costs, particularly in the short term. Revenue redistribution mitigates GDP losses but does so unevenly across regions. By leveraging a general equilibrium model (GTAP) to capture indirect effects often overlooked in prior studies, this analysis provides a comprehensive comparison of policy impacts. The findings underscore the need for equitable and pragmatic decarbonization strategies in the maritime sector, contributing to ongoing IMO policy discussions.

ID RISK ANALYSIS; DECISION
AB A multi-sectoral assessment of risks can support the management and investment decisions necessary for emerging blue economy industries to succeed. Traditional risk assessment methods will be challenged when applied to the complex socio-ecological systems that characterise offshore environments, and when data available to support management are lacking. Therefore, there is a need for assessments that account for multiple sectors. Here we describe the development of an efficient method for an integrated hazard analysis that is a precursor to full risk assessments. Our approach combines diverse disciplinary expertise, expert elicitation and multi-criteria analysis to rank hazards, so it encompasses all types of hazards including human-caused, natural and technological. We demonstrate our approach for two sectors that are predicted to grow rapidly in Australia: offshore aquaculture and marine renewable energy. Experts ranked Climate Change as the hazard with the highest overall concern, but hazards including Altered Ecosystem Function, Biosecurity, Cumulative Effects, Structural Failure and Social Licence were also highly ranked. We show here how outputs from this approach (multi-criteria scores and ranks) could be used to identify hazards that; i) could be safely retired, ii) should be progressed to more quantitative risk assessments or iii) require ongoing information collection. The approach can encompass all types of hazards, which enables it to holistically consider priorities. The expert-based multi-criteria approach outlined here represents a pragmatic way to solve some of the challenges of applying risk assessments to emerging industries by using a method that can be applied across multiple blue economy sectors.

AB The European Atlas of the Seas offers a snapshot of environmental and socio-economic features that characterize the coastal and marine environment. The latest release (Version 4) addresses the public in general, but also non-specialist experts involved with environmental issues, human activities or policies related to Europe's coasts and seas. The information content of the Atlas comprises a series of geographical layers, subdivided in "background maps", "thematic maps" (i.e. maritime Europe, natural setting, sea bottom, sea level rise, security, transport, tourism, energy, wind, fisheries and fish consumption) and "do-it-yourself maps" (dealing with marine knowledge, nature and environment, socio-economics, fisheries, aquaculture, transport, energy, sea bed mining, coastal tourism, Maritime Spatial Planning, integrated maritime surveillance, and international ocean governance). All maps follow consistent cartographic rules and can be extracted for external use. The Atlas database is updated regularly, but historical data remain accessible after the updates, so that time series may be constructed. Tools for map exploration and combination can be used to combine together more layers, providing professional users with analysis and interpretation capabilities, to couple data into graphical indicators. The Atlas aims to supports also policy making, on marine environment, maritime issues and economic sectors, both within and outside the European Institutions (e.g. on Common Fisheries Policy or Maritime Spatial Planning). Further, it expands the same support to near-coastal issues and matters related to land-sea interactions. The web application for accessing Atlas contents offers links to other Marine Information Systems, and is available to a broad audience from computers, tablets and mobile devices.

ID GENERATOR
AB The rapid development of the Internet of Things has resulted in the harvesting of distributed sustainable energy receiving increasing attention. Recently, a study on triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) for collecting low-frequency and irregular-amplitude ocean wave energy has attracted significant interest. Herein, a self-powered seesaw-structured spherical triboelectric-electromagnetic hybrid nanogenerator (SSTE-HNG) combining various working modes is presented for harvesting wide-frequency wave energy from different directions and self-powered sea surface wireless positioning. The electrical output performances were systematically investigated and optimized via studying the effects of the configuration parameters, including the central slider mass, oscillation frequency, and swing amplitude of each module and the entire device; the instantaneous maximum output power densities of the origami zigzag-multilayer structured (OZ), freestanding layer rolling (FL), and electromagnetic generator (EMG) modules can reach 17, 4.8, and 9.8 W m(-3), respectively, at an oscillation frequency of 0.7 Hz, and around 410 LEDs can be lit when operating the SSTE-HNG. Finally, the output voltage of the SSTE-HNG was stabilized using a transistor-controlled power management circuit for charging a 4.7 mF commercial capacitor in the range of 2.7 to 3.3 V; the seesaw-structured spherical buoy was used to drive a global positioning system (GPS) module for dynamic sea surface real-time wireless positioning, and our lab building on campus was successfully located upon installing the SSTE-HNG in a water tank. This study provides an ingenious design for achieving synchronized movements among hybrid effect/mode-based generators, and a self-powered buoy with a hybrid nanogenerator for sea surface wireless positioning was realized, which has the potential to be integrated with distributed electronics, such as sensors that collect sea surface meteorological information, in the future in the field of smart marine technology.

AB A low-cost floating photobioreactor (PBR) without the use of aeration and/or an agitation device, in which carbon was supplied in the form of bicarbonate and only wave energy was utilized for mixing, was developed in our previous study. Scaling up is a common challenge in the practical application of PBRs and has not yet been demonstrated for this new design. To fill this gap, cultivation of Spirulina platensis was conducted in this study. The results demonstrated that S. platensis had the highest productivity at 0.3molL(-1) sodium bicarbonate, but the highest carbon utilization (104 +/- 2.6%) was obtained at 0.1molL(-1). Culture of Spirulina aerated with pure oxygen resulted in only minor inhibition of growth, indicating that its productivity will not be significantly reduced even if dissolved oxygen is accumulated to a high level due to intermittent mixing resulting from the use of wave energy. In cultivation using a floating horizontal photobioreactor at the 1.0m(2) scale, the highest biomass concentration of 2.24 +/- 0.05gL(-1) was obtained with a culture depth of 5.0cm and the highest biomass productivity of 18.9gm(-2)day(-1) was obtained with a depth of 10.0cm. This PBR was scaled up to 10m(2) (1000L) with few challenges; biomass concentration and productivity during ocean testing were little different than those at the 1.0m(2) (100L) scale. However, the larger PBR had an apparent carbon utilization efficiency of 45.0 +/- 2.8%, significantly higher than the 39.4 +/- 0.9% obtained at the 1m(2) scale. These results verified the ease of scaling up floating horizontal photobioreactors and showed their great potential in commercial applications.

AB Gazi Bay located on the Kenyan South Coast is a semi-enclosed shallow tropical coastal ecosystem supporting an economically important multi-species and multi-gear artisanal fishery. In this study, we integrated the available scientific information of the system to develop a preliminary trophic mass-balance model to characterize the ecosystem structure and functioning, evaluate the ecological impacts of fishing on the ecosystem, and compare the results of the ecosystem assessment to those of previous single-species stock assessments. The model includes 23 functional groups aggregated into linear food chains, which resulted in nine discrete trophic levels sensu Lindeman (1942). Results from the mixed trophic impacts showed a bottom-up control in the system where herbivory dominated the energy flow to higher trophic levels but with a significant export of detritus out of the system. With a mean transfer efficiency of 12.6%, Finn cycling index 7.3%, path length 2.7, system omnivory index 0.19, and system ascendency and overhead 27 and 73%, respectively, it would appear that Gazi Bay is immature and perturbed likely due to fishery-induced exploitation. Overall, the fishery is operating at a level of primary consumers with a mean trophic level of the catch of 2.38. Fishing mortality is by far the leading cause of total mortality with the computed exploitation rates suggesting heavy exploitation of the key commercial species (F/Z > 0.5). A comparison of the results of the percentage of primary production required to sustain fisheries and the average trophic level of catch (%PPR-TLc) with those from similar tropical coastal systems shows that Gazi Bay is comparable to some of the most intensively exploited coastal ecosystems. This implies the impacts of the fishery are evident both at the species and ecosystem level, and there may be a need for precautionary measures for fisheries management.

ID EMISSION
AB Liquified natural gas (LNG) is a low-cost, cleaner fuel that reduces air pollutants and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, LNG-fueled engines have a methane slip issue, leading to increased carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e or CDE) emissions. This research introduced a new approach to combine the LNG-fueled engine with hybrid electric propulsion and real-time optimal control to maximize fuel efficiency and minimize CO2e emissions. In addition to low-cost LNG fuel, the approach controls and reduces the battery degradation costs to provide a clean and economical marine propulsion solution. An integrated globally optimal propulsion system design and real-time optimal control strategy for the LNG-fueled hybrid electric ships effectively addressed the methane slip-triggered emissions issue of natural gas (NG) engines, reducing CO2e emissions by 12.28% and the high-cost and relatively short life of the hybrid propulsion system's battery energy storage system (BESS), decreasing battery capacity loss by 12%. The optimal sizing of the NG-diesel dual-fuel compression ignition (CI) engine and BESS and the optimal baseline power control and energy management strategy (EMS) are jointly created using dynamic programming (DP) for the vessel's statistical data-based, normal operation profile. As marine vessels have more variations of propulsion power demand than road vehicles due to varying ocean operation conditions, two new methods are introduced to accurately predict the varying propulsion power demands and dynamically update the BESS's state of health (SOH) in real-time. The former applies an extended Kalman filter (EKF) on both real-time vessel operation data and the statistical vessel operation cycle to more accurately predict vessel power demand, and the latter compares the instantly measured battery output voltage data with the battery performance and degradation models built using extensive battery test data to capture the state of the BESS more precisely. These two new update schemes lead to an extended model predictive control (MPC) approach for the real-time optimal power control and energy management of the hybrid electric ship operation, considering the NG fuel consumption, CO2e emissions and BESS degradation associated costs. The newly introduced NG-engine hybrid electric propulsion system component size and EKF-MPC real-time control optimization techniques have been tested using the technical specification and operation data of a real mediumsized vehicle and passenger ferry in operation, with reduced CO2e emissions and battery capacity loss and lowered ferry operating costs by $305,286 over 10 years of operations.

AB Under the Atmospheric River Reconnaissance (AR Recon) Program, ocean drifting buoys (drifters) that provide surface pressure observations were deployed in the northeastern Pacific Ocean to improve forecasts of U.S. West Coast high-impact weather. We examine the impacts of both AR Recon and non-AR Recon drifter observations in the U.S. Navy's global atmospheric data assimilation (DA) and forecast system using data-denial experiments and forecast sensitivity observation impact (FSOI) analysis, which estimates the impact of each observation on the 24-h global forecast error total energy. Considering all drifters in the eastern North Pacific for the 2020 AR Recon season, FSOI indicates that most of the beneficial impacts come from observations in the lowest quartile of observed surface pressure values, particularly those taken late in the DA window. Observations in the upper quartile have near-neutral impacts on average and are slightly nonbeneficial when taken late in the DA window. This may occur because the DA configuration used here does not account for model biases, and innovation statistics show that the forecast model has a low pressure bias at high pressures. Case studies and other analyses indicate large beneficial impacts coming from observations in regions with large surface pressure gradients and integrated vapor transport, such as fronts and ARs. Data-denial experiments indicate that the assimilation of AR Recon drifter observations results in a better-constrained analysis at nearby non-AR Recon drifter locations and counteracts the NAVGEM pressure bias. Assimilating the AR Recon drifter observations improves 72- and 96-h Northern Hemisphere forecasts of winds in the lower and middle troposphere, and geopotential height in the lower, middle, and upper troposphere. Significance StatementThe purpose of this study is to understand how observations of atmospheric pressure at the ocean surface provided by drifting buoys impact weather forecasts. Some of these drifting buoys were deployed under a program to study atmospheric rivers (ARs) to improve forecasts of high-impact weather on the West Coast. We find that these observations are most effective at reducing forecast errors when taken in regions near fronts and cyclones. The additional drifting buoys deployed under the AR Reconnaissance project reduce forecast errors at 72 and 96 h over North America and the Northern Hemisphere. These results are important because they illustrate the potential for improving forecasts by increasing the number of drifting buoy surface pressure observations over the world oceans.

AB By synthesising remote-sensing measurements made in the central Arctic into a model-gridded Cloudnet cloud product, we evaluate how well the Met Office Unified Model (UM) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) capture Arctic clouds and their associated interactions with the surface energy balance and the thermodynamic structure of the lower troposphere. This evaluation was conducted using a 4-week observation period from the Arctic Ocean 2018 expedition, where the transition from sea ice melting to freezing conditions was measured. Three different cloud schemes were tested within a nested limited-area model (LAM) configuration of the UM - two regionally operational single-moment schemes (UM_RA2M and UM_RA2T) and one novel double-moment scheme (UM_CASIM-100) - while one global simulation was conducted with the IFS, utilising its default cloud scheme (ECMWF_IFS). Consistent weaknesses were identified across both models, with both the UM and IFS overestimating cloud occurrence below 3 km. This overestimation was also consistent across the three cloud configurations used within the UM framework, with >90% mean cloud occurrence simulated between 0.15 and 1 km in all the model simulations. However, the cloud microphysical structure, on average, was modelled reasonably well in each simulation, with the cloud liquid water content (LWC) and ice water content (IWC) comparing well with observations over much of the vertical profile. The key microphysical discrepancy between the models and observations was in the LWC between 1 and 3 km, where most simulations (all except UM_RA2T) overestimated the observed LWC. Despite this reasonable performance in cloud physical structure, both models failed to adequately capture cloud-free episodes: this consistency in cloud cover likely contributes to the ever-present near-surface temperature bias in every simulation. Both models also consistently exhibited temperature and moisture biases below 3 km, with particularly strong cold biases coinciding with the overabundant modelled cloud layers. These biases are likely due to too much cloud-top radiative cooling from these persistent modelled cloud layers and wereconsistent across the three UM configurations tested, despite differences in their parameterisations of cloud on a sub-grid scale. Alarmingly, our findings suggest that these biases in the regional model were inherited from the global model, driving a cause-effect relationship between the excessive low-altitude cloudiness and the coincident cold bias. Using representative cloud condensation nuclei concentrations in our double-moment UM configuration while improving cloud microphysical structure does little to alleviate these biases; therefore, no matter how comprehensive we make the cloud physics in the nested LAM configuration used here, its cloud and thermodynamic structure will continue to be overwhelmingly biased by the meteorological conditions of its driving model.

TI Jarzynski equality and Crooks relation for local models of air-sea

SO EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID WIND STRESS; ENERGY; INPUT
AB We show that the most prominent of the work theorems, the Jarzynski equality and the Crooks relation, can be applied to the momentum transfer at the air-sea interface using a hierarchy of local models. In the more idealized models, with and without a Coriolis force, the variability is provided from Gaussian white noise which modifies the shear between the atmosphere and the ocean. The dynamics is Gaussian, and the Jarzynski equality and Crooks relation can be obtained analytically solving stochastic differential equations. The more involved model consists of interacting atmospheric and oceanic boundary layers, where only the dependence on the vertical direction is resolved, the turbulence is modeled through standard turbulent models and the stochasticity comes from a randomized drag coefficient. It is integrated numerically and can give rise to a non-Gaussian dynamics. Also in this case the Jarzynski equality allows for calculating a dynamic beta beta(D) of the turbulent fluctuations (the equivalent of the thermodynamic beta beta = (k(B) T)(-1) in thermal fluctuations). The Crooks relation gives the beta(D) as a function of the magnitude of the work fluctuations. It is well defined (constant) in the Gaussian models and can show a slight variation in the more involved models. This demonstrates that recent concepts of stochastic thermodynamics used to study micro-systems subject to thermal fluctuations can further the understanding of geophysical fluid dynamics with turbulent fluctuations.

AB Hydrogen peroxide is part of an important radiolytic cycle on Europa and may be a critical source of oxidants to the putative subsurface ocean. The surface geographic distribution of hydrogen peroxide may constrain the processes governing its abundance as well as its potential relevance to the subsurface chemistry. However, maps of Europa's hydrogen peroxide beyond hemispherical averages have never been published. Here, we present spatially resolved L-band (3.16-4 mu m) observations of Europa's 3.5 mu m hydrogen peroxide absorption, which we obtained using the Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSPEC) and the adaptive optics system on the Keck II telescope. Using these data, we map the strength of the 3.5 mu m absorption across the surface at a nominal spatial resolution of similar to 300 km. Though previous disk-integrated data seemed consistent with the laboratory expectation that Europa's hydrogen peroxide exists primarily in its coldest and iciest regions, we find nearly the exact opposite at this finer spatial scale. Instead, we observe the largest hydrogen peroxide absorptions at low latitudes on the leading and anti-Jovian hemispheres, correlated with chaos terrain, and relative depletions toward the cold, icy high latitudes. This distribution may reflect the effects of decreased hydrogen peroxide destruction due to efficient electron scavenging by CO2 within chaos terrain.

AB Climate model components involve both high-dimensional input and output fields. It is desirable to efficiently generate spatio-temporal outputs of these models for applications in integrated assessment modelling or to assess the statistical relationship between such sets of inputs and outputs, for example, uncertainty analysis. However, the need for efficiency often compromises the fidelity of output through the use of low complexity models. Here, we develop a technique which combines statistical emulation with a dimensionality reduction technique to emulate a wide range of outputs from an atmospheric general circulation model, PLASIM, as functions of the boundary forcing prescribed by the ocean component of a lower complexity climate model, GENIE-1. Although accurate and detailed spatial information on atmospheric variables such as precipitation and wind speed is well beyond the capability of GENIE-1's energy-moisture balance model of the atmosphere, this study demonstrates that the output of this model is useful in predicting PLASIM's spatio-temporal fields through multi-level emulation. Meaningful information from the fast model, GENIE-1 was extracted by utilising the correlation between variables of the same type in the two models and between variables of different types in PLASIM. We present here the construction and validation of several PLASIM variable emulators and discuss their potential use in developing a hybrid model with statistical components.

ID PLASTIC NANOPARTICLES; MICROPLASTICS; PATHWAY
AB Polystyrene (PS) often found in the ocean is one of the most commonly used plastic polymers in the world and can exist in different particle sizes. In particular, PS degrades relatively faster and widely accumulates at the nanoscale. There-fore, the penetration is strong and it is easy to enter the body and cause adverse effects. However, the persistence or recovery of their toxicity remains largely unclear. Here, we designed two subexperiments (exposure and recovery ex-periments) and investigated the persistence of the toxicity of polystyrene (PS) NPs at a wide concentration range (0.01-10 mg/L) to diatoms (Phaeodactylum tricornutum). PS-NPs significantly inhibited algal growth and clearly wrin-kled the surfaces of cells, membrane permeability was significantly increased, and the steady-state state of cell redox and mitochondrial membrane potential was disturbed. However, in the recovery experiment, the increased membrane permeability was observed to persist, but the induced oxidative damage was reversible, and the absorbed NPs could be excreted. Integrated omics techniques (metabolomics and transcriptomics) revealed that PS-NPs significantly disrupts cell metabolism, including disturbances in fatty acid biosynthesis and enhanced biosynthesis of phenylalanine, tyro-sine, and tryptophan. Inhibition of fatty acid, amino acid, energy and carbohydrate metabolism and disturbance of the antioxidant system contribute to the persistence of toxicity. These findings highlight the phenomena and mecha-nisms of the persistence of phytotoxicity and are critical to the accurate assessment of NPs.

AB The stability of variable cross-section cold-water pipes (CWPs) is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) systems under complex marine conditions. This paper introduces a novel semi-analytical framework to assess the stability of CWPs subjected to multiple clump weights, which is ignored by previous works. The dynamic response equation is established based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, accounting for both inertia forces and gravitational effects of the clump weights. To efficiently and accurately compute the dynamic stability of variable cross-section CWPs, a hybrid method integrating the SturmLiouville Eigenvalues Using Theta matrices (SLEUTH) with the Generalized Integral Transform Technique (GITT) is proposed. The problem is transformed into an auxiliary eigenvalue problem and a second-order differential equation with time-dependent coefficients. Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are computed at discrete points using the SLEUTH method, while coefficients of the differential equation are determined through numerical techniques like the Newton-Cotes formula, Gaussian functions, and exponential functions. The GITT method is employed to solve the transverse vibration equation. Validation with numerical examples demonstrates rapid convergence and high accuracy. Further investigation reveals that the weight, position, and number of clump weights significantly influence CWP stability, providing key insights for OTEC design improvements.

AB In this research, we use several ansatz transformations to study analytical solutions of different nonlinear waves (such as lump soliton, periodic waves, multi-waves, lump one kink, and lump two kink) for a well-known model, the Landau-Ginzburg-Higgs model. The Landau-Ginzburg-Higgs (LGH) model combines concepts from particle physics and condensed matter physics to describe phase transitions and symmetry-breaking processes. It integrates the particle physics concepts of the Higgs mechanism, the Landau theory of phase transitions, and the Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity. A lump soliton is a confined wave phenomenon that travels through a medium without changing form or amplitude. These solitons are produced in a variety of nonlinear systems, including optical fibers and some kinds of fluid dynamics equations, where they are essential for transferring energy and information. Periodic waves are defined by consistent, recurring oscillation patterns in both space and time. These waves are essential to many technology applications and natural phenomena, such as electromagnetic radiation and ocean waves. A confined wave disturbance with a single sudden shift in amplitude is referred to as a soliton with one kink, or single-kink soliton. A soliton with two kinks is a solution for a solitary wave that has two localized areas where the wave profile bends or alters abruptly. The solutions are graphically displayed using contour, 3D, and 2D graphs.

AB Australia is one of the two largest exporting nations for beef and lamb in the world and the USA is a major export market for both products. To inform the Australian red meat industry regarding the environmental performance of exported food products, this study conducted the first multi-impact analysis of Australian red meat export supply chains including all stages through to warehousing in the USA. A large, integrated dataset based on case study farms and regional survey was used to model beef and lamb from major representative production regions in eastern Australia. Per kilogram of retail-ready red meat, fresh water consumption ranged from 441.7 to 597.6 L across the production systems, stress-weighted water use from 108.5 to 169.4 L H2O-e, fossil energy from 28.1 to 46.6 MJ, crop land occupation from 2.5 to 29.9 m(2) and human edible protein conversion efficiency ranged from 7.9 to 0.3, with major differences observed between grass finished and grain finished production. GHG emissions excluding land use and direct land use change ranged from 16.1 to 27.2 kg CO2-e per kilogram, and removals and emissions from land use and direct land use change ranged from -2.4 to 8.7 kg CO2-e per kilogram of retail retail ready meat.
   Process based life cycle assessment shows that environmental impacts and resource use were highest in the farm and feedlot phase. Transportation contributed <= 5% of greenhouse gas emissions, water and land, confirming that food miles is not a suitable indicator of environmental impacts for red meat transported by ocean shipping. The contribution of international transportation to total energy demand was higher, ranging from 14 to 23%. These beef and lamb supply chains were found to rely on small volumes of water from stressed water catchments, and occupied only small amounts of crop land suited to other food production systems. Production of high quality protein foods for human consumption used only small amounts of protein from human edible grain. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Coastal wetlands represent an ecotone between ocean and terrestrial ecosystems, providing important services, including flood mitigation, fresh water supply, erosion control, carbon sequestration, and wildlife habitat. The environmental setting of a wetland and the hydrological connectivity between a wetland and adjacent terrestrial and aquatic systems together determine wetland hydrology. Yet little is known about regional-scale hydrological interactions among uplands, coastal wetlands, and coastal processes, such as tides, sea level rise, and saltwater intrusion, which together control the dynamics of wetland hydrology. This study presents a new regional-scale, physically based, distributed wetland hydrological model, PIHM-Wetland, which integrates the surface and subsurface hydrology with coastal processes and accounts for the influence of wetland inundation on energy budgets and evapotranspiration (ET). The model was validated using in situ hydro-meteorological measurements and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ET data for a forested and herbaceous wetland in North Carolina, USA, which confirmed that the model accurately represents the major wetland hydrological behaviours. Modelling results indicate that topographic gradient is a primary control of groundwater flow direction in adjacent uplands. However, seasonal climate patterns become the dominant control of groundwater flow at lower coastal plain and land-ocean interface. We found that coastal processes largely influence groundwater table (GWT) dynamics in the coastal zone, 300 to 800m from the coastline in our study area. Among all the coastal processes, tides are the dominant control on GWT variation. Because of inundation, forested and herbaceous wetlands absorb an additional 6% and 10%, respectively, of shortwave radiation annually, resulting in a significant increase in ET. Inundation alters ET partitioning through canopy evaporation, transpiration, and soil evaporation, the effect of which is stronger in cool seasons than in warm seasons. The PIHM-Wetland model provides a new tool that improves the understanding of wetland hydrological processes on a regional scale. Insights from this modelling study provide benchmarks for future research on the effects of sea level rise and climate change on coastal wetland functions and services.

AB One of the fundamental factors contributing to the spatiotemporal inaccuracy in climate modeling is the mapping of solution field data between different discretizations and numerical grids used in the coupled component models. The typical climate computational workflow involves evaluation and serialization of the remapping weights during the preprocessing step, which is then consumed by the coupled driver infrastructure during simulation to compute field projections. Tools like Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) (Hill et al., 2004) and TempestRemap (Ullrich et al., 2013) offer capability to generate conservative remapping weights, while the Model Coupling Toolkit (MCT) (Larson et al., 2001) that is utilized in many production climate models exposes functionality to make use of the operators to solve the coupled problem. However, such multistep processes present several hurdles in terms of the scientific workflow and impede research productivity. In order to overcome these limitations, we present a fully integrated infrastructure based on the Mesh Oriented datABase (MOAB) (Tautges et al., 2004; Mahadevan et al., 2015) library, which allows for a complete description of the numerical grids and solution data used in each submodel. Through a scalable advancing-front intersection algorithm, the supermesh of the source and target grids are computed, which is then used to assemble the high-order, conservative, and monotonicity-preserving remapping weights between discretization specifications. The Fortran-compatible interfaces in MOAB are utilized to directly link the submodels in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) to enable online remapping strategies in order to simplify the coupled workflow process. We demonstrate the superior computational efficiency of the remapping algorithms in comparison with other state-of-the-science tools and present strong scaling results on large-scale machines for computing remapping weights between the spectral element atmosphere and finite volume discretizations on the polygonal ocean grids.

AB One of the potential options for usage in wave energy conversion systems of the oscillating water column (OWC) type is the Wells turbine. Because of its relatively small output power and limited operating range, the cost of producing power increases, so the Wells turbine can only be used in a few ocean locations. Early deterioration of the turbine's performance resulted from the early turbine stall, which limits the power produced and the operating range because it does not operate in stall conditions. The current work aims to increase the Wells turbine's output power and operating range through a new turbine design. This design aims to integrate variable tip clearance design and casing groove design. A response surface optimization technique based on computa-tional fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to determine the optimum dimensions of the new design. The present study utilized the toolbox for response surface optimization of the ANSYS software. Five geometrical parameters for the new turbine design were used as inputs for the optimization approach. At a flow coefficient of 0.250, the optimization technique sought to optimize the Wells turbine's torque coefficient (CT). The Wells turbine's average and maximum torque coefficients are improved by 39.13% and 74.32%, respectively. Compared to the typical design, the optimized design expands the operating range (OR) of the Wells turbine by 33.33%. The torque coefficient and efficiency of the enhanced Wells turbine increase by 82.97% and 71.64%, respectively, at a flow coefficient of 0.250. The torque coefficient modification factor of the enhanced Wells turbine is increased by 94.78% compared to the typical turbine. Based on a detailed flow analysis, the optimal new design reduces the axial flow velocities near the suction side on most of the blade span, which delays the flow's separation toward the trailing edge, which delays the inception of the enhanced turbine stall.

AB During the southwest monsoons, the Arabian Sea (AS) develops highly energetic mesoscale variability associated with the Somali Current (SC), Great Whirl (GW), and cold filaments (CF). The resultant high-amplitude anomalies and gradients of sea surface temperature (SST) and surface currents modify the wind stress, triggering the so-called mesoscale coupled feedbacks. This study uses a high-resolution regional coupled model with a novel coupling procedure that separates spatial scales of the air-sea coupling to show that SST and surface currents are coupled to the atmosphere at distinct spatial scales, exerting distinct dynamic influences. The effect of mesoscale SST-wind interaction is manifested most strongly in wind work and Ekman pumping over the GW, primarily affecting the position of GW and the separation latitude of the SC. If this effect is suppressed, enhanced wind work and a weakened Ekman pumping dipole cause the GW to extend northeastward, delaying the SC separation by 1 degrees. Current-wind interaction, in contrast, is related to the amount of wind energy input. When it is suppressed, especially as a result of background-scale currents, depth-integrated kinetic energy, both the mean and eddy, is significantly enhanced. Ekman pumping velocity over the GW is overly negative because of a lack of vorticity that offsets the wind stress curl, further invigorating the GW. Moreover, significant changes in time-mean SST and evaporation are generated in response to the current-wind interaction, accompanied by a noticeable southward shift in the Findlater Jet. The significant increase in moisture transport in the central AS implies that air-sea interaction mediated by the surface current is a potentially important process for simulation and prediction of the monsoon rainfall.

AB underwater acoustic communications are half-duplex (HD), i.e., the hydrophones and transducers operate in non-overlapping time-slots/frequency-bands in one di-rection. To double the spectral efficiency into the full-duplex (FD) mode, which transmit and receive signals simultaneously, a self -interference cancellation (SIC) technique in space is introduced and deployed. Specifically, a novel underwater acoustic system is proposed to perform FD-SIC efficiently via an integrated design combining underwater acoustic vector sensor (AVS) and phased array transducer (PAT) to realize the spatial SIC. The energy focusing function of the beamformer (BF) helps PAT avoid self and mutual spatial interference. The AVS keeps updating the direction of arrival information to let BF adjust the steering angle via an adaptive protocol. The field-programmable gate array (FPGA) Direction of Arrival Estimation (DOA) estimation is done by a 12-element AVS, run-time is 1.22x10-4 s by MUSIC method, which is promising for real-time applications. In this work, phase-shift keying (PSK) and PSK-based orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) are deployed as the FD transmission modulation methods in the spacial SIC. The proposal is evaluated and verified via both simulations and emulations in real underwater acoustic channels collected in the Gulf of La Spezia, Italy, and it is able to achieve 59 dB SIC while modulating with binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) with carrier wave frequency 80 kHz and AVS steering angle -5 degrees. Moreover, it has at least 37 dB SIC within the steering angle region.

AB The shoaling process of a group of internal solitary waves (ISWs) in the southern Red Sea is simulated with a three dimensional, nonhydrostatic, high-resolution MIT general circulation model. The breaking and dissipation processes are well reproduced, in which a positive tail forms behind and locally moves the interface upward, causing the transformation of wave polarity as it moves onshore. With the step-like structure followed, the wave eventually evolves into smaller water bores. Combined with the parameters of the leading wave slope (S-w) of about 0.07 and topography slope (S) of about 0.01, the shoaling is suggested to follow a mild breaking process. The particle transport during the shoaling process is further examined quantitatively using the Connectivity modeling system (CMS). About 38,400 particles are released at six different vertical layers in the main shoaling domain. Most of the particles are transported up-and-down following the wave oscillation process then settle within 10-20 m around the original released depth. For the particles inside the breaking area, the oscillation process becomes more complex and intensified, and eventually a great portion of these particles settle far away from their released locations. The time-integrated transport distance, T-i, and the direct transport distance, T-s, are also analyzed. With T-i almost 20 times to T-s in vertical, continuous up-and-down movements are suggested during the shoaling process.

AB A new diagnostic convective closure, which is dependent on convective available potential energy (CAPE), is derived under the quasi-equilibrium assumption for the free troposphere subject to boundary layer forcing. The closure involves a convective adjustment time scale for the free troposphere and a coupling coefficient between the free troposphere and the boundary layer based on different time scales over land and ocean. Earlier studies with the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) have already demonstrated the model's ability to realistically represent tropical convectively coupled waves and synoptic variability with use of the standard CAPE closure, given realistic entrainment rates.A comparison of low-resolution seasonal integrations and high-resolution short-range forecasts against complementary satellite and radar data shows that with the extended CAPE closure it is also possible, independent of model resolution and time step, to realistically represent nonequilibrium convection such as the diurnal cycle of convection and the convection tied to advective boundary layers, although representing the late night convection over land remains a challenge. A more in-depth regional analysis of the diurnal cycle and the closure is provided for the continental United States and particularly Africa, including comparison with data from satellites and a cloud-resolving model (CRM). Consequences for global numerical weather prediction (NWP) are not only a better phase representation of convection, but also better forecasts of its spatial distribution and local intensity.

AB Coastal storms cause widespread damage to property, infrastructure, economic activity, and the environment. Along open sandy coastlines, two of the primary coastal storm hazards are coastal flooding by elevated ocean water levels and beach erosion as the result of storm wave action. At continental margins characterized by a shallow, wide continental shelf, coastal storms are more commonly associated with amplified storm surge and the damaging impacts caused by flooding of low-lying land. In contrast, along margins where the continental shelf is narrow and deep, coastal storm impacts are more often characterized by beach erosion, due to the typically lower magnitude of storm surge but a higher proportion of deepwater wave energy reaching the shoreline. A new Storm Hazard Matrix is presented that integrates these two distinct but inherently linked open coast hazards. The approach is based on the combination of two hazard scales. The first is a 'coastal flooding hazard scale' that follows an established framework in which hazards are predominately driven by the vertical increase in ocean water levels during storms and any significant morphological changes caused by the storm are inferred. The second is a storm wave 'beach erosion hazard scale' where hazards are predominately determined by the horizontal recession of the sandy beach and dune without necessarily large increases in water levels. The resulting framework comprises a total of sixteen unique combinations of flooding/erosion storm hazard regimes, each potentially requiring different disaster risk reduction approaches. Real-world application of the Storm Hazard Matrix is explored at contrasting coastlines for two major storm events, encompassing an extratropical cyclone that impacted the coastline of southeast Australia in June 2016, and a large hurricane (Hurricane Ivan) that impacted the Gulf Coast of the United States in 2004. The new approach identifies and distinguishes between the severity of localized coastal flooding and/or coastal erosion, and also provides enhanced insight to the nature, magnitude and alongshore variation of coastal storm hazards along the impacted coastline. Within the context of disaster risk reduction, preparedness and operational early warning, implementation of the Storm Hazard Matrix has the potential to deliver robust evaluations of storm hazards spanning a wider variety of both wave-dominated and surge-dominated coasts.

ID PIEZOELECTRIC MEMS; BROAD-BAND; DESIGN
AB Structure design of ultra-low wide bandwidth vibrational energy harvesters remains an open issue. In this research, a statically balanced compliant mechanism (SBCM) is proposed, dynamically modelled, and experimentally demonstrated to address this need. This SBCM is designed based on the concept of stiffness compensation between a linear component with positive-stiffness (two double parallelograms in parallel) and a nonlinear component with negative-stiffness (two sets of post-buckled fixed-guided compliant beams in parallel). A design guideline of the SBCM starting from using rapid-design stiffness compensation equation is provided for reasonably approximate and accurate results. Subsequently, a dynamic analytical model of the displacement response of the SBCM to harmonic base excitation has been derived based on the averaging method. The nonlinear force-displacement relationship of the system was obtained through nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) simulations in this regard and a 5th order polynomial fit was chosen taking only odd terms into account. The accuracy of this analytical model is confirmed by numerical analysis. Next, a prototype of the SBCM was fabricated and its applicability to piezoelectric vibrational energy harvesters (PVEHs) was demonstrated by integrating piezoelectric capacitors made of PVDF films with compliant beams of the SBCM to generate electric outputs in response to the bending of the beams. Static balancing is achieved over a continuous displacement range of 2 mm around the origin. Bi-stability and mono-stability were observed with the same prototype by adjusting the length of the positive-stiffness beams. Under static-balancing condition, the SBCM is able to respond to a wide range of ultra-low frequencies with low accelerations, which has been established experimentally, analytically and numerically. In dynamic experiments, the steady-state relative displacement amplitude H is 2.9 mm under an excitation condition of 6 Hz and 0.1g (1g=9.8 m/s(2)), and it reaches a maximum of 9.4 mm under 12.75 Hz and 0.25 g. A 30%-H-max frequency bandwidth is introduced to assess the nonlinear dynamic performance of the SBCM from a mechanical perspective. The maximum experimental 30%-H-max bandwidth of the structure is 6.75 Hz (from 6 Hz to 12.75 Hz) at 0.25 g and the corresponding theoretical value is 8.73 Hz (from 3.34 Hz to 12.07 Hz). Under the same excitation condition, it is shown that the maximum relative displacement amplitude deceases as the jump-down frequency increases. In addition, super-harmonic and sub harmonic oscillations are observed in the dynamic experiments. The SBCM can provide a practical structural solution for harvesting energy from a range of vibrational scenarios (e.g. ocean waves, human motions and bridge vibrations) with ultra-low wide bandwidth frequencies and weak accelerations. The concept of SBCM is suitable to be combined with various energy conversion principles and is not limited to piezoelectric sources alone. When miniaturized, the SBCM concept can be of particular interest to researchers active in energy harvesting for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology.

TI Surface mass balance and climate of the Last Glacial Maximum Northern

AB The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, from similar to 26 to 20 ka BP) was the most recent period with large ice sheets in Eurasia and North America. At that time, global temperatures were 5-7 circle C lower than today, and sea level similar to 125 m lower. LGM simulations are useful to understand earth system dynamics, including climate-ice sheet interactions, and to evaluate and improve the models representing those dynamics. Here, we present two simulations of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheet climate and surface mass balance (SMB) with the Community Earth System Model v2.1 (CESM2.1) using the Community Atmosphere Model v5 (CAM5) with prescribed ice sheets for two time periods that bracket the LGM period: 26 and 21 ka BP. CESM2.1 includes an explicit simulation of snow/firn compaction, albedo, refreezing, and direct coupling of the ice sheet surface energy fluxes with the atmosphere. The simulated mean snow accumulation is lowest for the Greenland and Barents-Kara Sea ice sheets (GrIS, BKIS) and highest for British and Irish (BIIS) and Icelandic (IcIS) ice sheets. Melt rates are negligible for the dry BKIS and GrIS, and relatively large for the BIIS, North American ice sheet complex (NAISC; i.e. Laurentide, Cordilleran, and Innuitian), Scandinavian ice sheet (SIS), and IcIS, and are reduced by almost a third in the colder (lower temperature) 26 ka BP climate compared with 21 ka BP. The SMB is positive for the GrIS, BKIS, SIS, and IcIS during the LGM (26 and 21 ka BP) and negative for the NAISC and BIIS. Relatively wide ablation areas are simulated along the southern (terrestrial), Pacific and Atlantic margins of the NAISC, across the majority of the BIIS, and along the terrestrial southern margin of the SIS. The integrated SMB substantially increases for the NAISC and BIIS in the 26 ka BP climate, but it does not reverse the negative sign. Summer incoming surface solar radiation is largest over the high interior of the NAISC and GrIS, and minimum over the BIIS and southern margin of NAISC. Summer net radiation is maximum over the ablation areas and minimum where the albedo is highest, namely in the interior of the GrIS, northern NAISC, and all of the BKIS. Summer sensible and latent heat fluxes are highest over the ablation areas, positively contributing to melt energy. Refreezing is largest along the equilibrium line altitude for all ice sheets and prevents 40 %-50 % of meltwater entering the ocean. The large simulated melt for the NAISC suggests potential biases in the climate simulation, ice sheet reconstruction, and/or highly non-equilibrated climate and ice sheet at the LGM time.

AB Objective: To measure the localised irradiance and wavelength distributions from dental light curing units (LCUs) and establish a method to characterise their output.
   Methods: Using a laboratory grade integrating sphere spectrometer system (Labsphere and Ocean Optics) the power, irradiance, and spectral emission were measured at the light tips of four LCUs: one plasma-arc (PAC) unit, one single peak blue light-emitting diode (blue-LED) unit, and two polywave LED (poly-LED) units. A beam profiler camera (Ophir Spiricon) was used to record the localised irradiance across the face of the light tips. The irradiance-calibrated beam profile images were then divided into 45 squares, each 1 mm(2). Each square contained the irradiance information received from approximately 3200 pixels. The mean irradiance value within each square was calculated, and the distribution of irradiance values among these 45 squares across the tip-ends was examined. Additionally, the spectral emission was recorded at various regions across each light tip using the integrating sphere with a 4-mm diameter entrance aperture.
   Results: The localised irradiance distribution was inhomogeneous in all four lights. The irradiance distribution was most uniformly distributed across the PAC tip. Both the irradiance and spectral emission from the poly-LED units were very unevenly distributed.
   Conclusions: Reporting a single irradiance value or a single spectral range to describe the output from a curing light is both imprecise and inappropriate. Instead, an image of both the irradiance distribution and the distribution of the spectral emission across the light tip should be provided.
   Clinical significance: The localised beam irradiance profile at the tip of dental LCUs is not uniform. Poly-LED units may deliver spectrally inhomogeneous irradiance profiles. Depending on the photoinitiator used in the RBC and the orientation of the LCU over the tooth, this non-uniformity may cause inadequate and inhomogeneous resin polymerisation, leading to poor physical properties, and premature failure of the restoration.

AB The Bering Sea is located between the Aleutian Low and Siberian High, with strong seasonal variations in the oceanic circulation and the sea ice coverage. Within such a large-scale system, the physical processes in the Bering Sea carry interannual variability. The special topography in the Bering Sea traps a strong jet along the Bering Slope, whose instability enriches the eddy activity in the region. A Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS), coupled with a sea ice module, is employed to study multiple-scale variability in the sea ice and oceanic circulation in the Bering Sea for interannual, seasonal, and intra-seasonal eddy variations. The model domain covers the whole Bering Sea and a part of the Chukchi Sea and south of Aleutian Islands, with an averaged spatial resolution of 5 km. The external forcings are momentum, heat, and freshwater flux at the surface and adaptive nudging to reanalysis fields at the boundaries. The oceanic model starts in an equilibrium state from a multiple year cyclical climatology run, and then it is integrated from years 1990 through 2004. The 15 year simulation is analyzed and assessed against the observational data. The model accurately reproduces the seasonal and interannual variations in the sea ice coverage compared with the satellite-observed sea ice data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). Sea surface temperature and eddy kinetic energy patterns from the ROMS agree with satellite remote sensing data. The transportation through the Bering Strait is also comparable with the estimate of mooring data. The mechanism for seasonal and interannual variation in the Bering Sea is connected to the Siberia-Aleutian index. Eddy variation along the Bering Slope is discussed. The model also simulates polynya generation and evolution around the St. Lawrence Island.

AB The Ocean Aware project, led by Innovasea and funded through Canada's Ocean Supercluster, is developing a fish passage observation platform to monitor fish without the use of traditional tags. This will provide an alternative to standard tracking technology, such as acoustic telemetry fish tracking, which are often not appropriate for tracking at-risk fish species protected by legislation. Rather, the observation platform uses a combination of sensors including acoustic devices, visual and active sonar, and optical cameras. This will enable more in-depth scientific research and better support regulatory monitoring of at-risk fish species in fish passages or marine energy sites. Analysis of this data will require a robust and accurate method to automatically detect fish, count fish, and classify them by species in real-time using both sonar and optical cameras. To meet this need, we developed and tested an automated real-time deep learning framework combining state of the art convolutional neural networks and Kalman filters. First, we showed that an adaptation of the widely used YOLO machine learning model can accurately detect and classify eight species of fish from a public high resolution DIDSON imaging sonar dataset captured from the Ocqueoc River in Michigan, USA. Although there has been extensive research in the literature identifying particular fish such as eel vs. non-eel and seal vs. fish, to our knowledge this is the first successful application of deep learning for classifying multiple fish species with high resolution imaging sonar. Second, we integrated the Norfair object tracking framework to track and count fish using a public video dataset captured by optical cameras from the Wells Dam fish ladder on the Columbia River in Washington State, USA. Our results demonstrate that deep learning models can indeed be used to detect, classify species, and track fish using both high resolution imaging sonar and underwater video from a fish ladder. This work is a first step toward developing a fully implemented system which can accurately detect, classify and generate insights about fish in a wide variety of fish passage environments and conditions with data collected from multiple types of sensors.

AB Estuaries are biogeochemical hot spots because they receive large inputs of nutrients and organic carbon from land and oceans to support high rates of metabolism and primary production. We synthesize published rates of annual phytoplankton primary production (APPP) in marine ecosystems influenced by connectivity to land - estuaries, bays, lagoons, fjords and inland seas. Review of the scientific literature produced a compilation of 1148 values of APPP derived from monthly incubation assays to measure carbon assimilation or oxygen production. The median value of median APPP measurements in 131 ecosystems is 185 and the mean is 252 gCm(-2) yr(-1), but the range is large: from -105 (net pelagic production in the Scheldt Estuary) to 1890 g Cm-2 yr(-1) (net phytoplankton production in Tamagawa Estuary). APPP varies up to 10-fold within ecosystems and 5-fold from year to year (but we only found eight APPP series longer than a decade so our knowledge of decadal-scale variability is limited). We use studies of individual places to build a conceptual model that integrates the mechanisms generating this large variability: nutrient supply, light limitation by turbidity, grazing by consumers, and physical processes (river inflow, ocean exchange, and inputs of heat, light and wind energy). We consider method as another source of variability because the compilation includes values derived from widely differing protocols. A simulation model shows that different methods reported in the literature can yield up to 3-fold variability depending on incubation protocols and methods for integrating measured rates over time and depth.
   Although attempts have been made to upscale measures of estuarine-coastal APPP, the empirical record is inadequate for yielding reliable global estimates. The record is deficient in three ways. First, it is highly biased by the large number of measurements made in northern Europe (particularly the Baltic region) and North America. Of the 1148 reported values of APPP, 958 come from sites between 30 and 60 degrees N; we found only 36 for sites south of 20 degrees N. Second, of the 131 ecosystems where APPP has been reported, 37% are based on measurements at only one location during 1 year. The accuracy of these values is unknown but probably low, given the large interannual and spatial variability within ecosystems. Finally, global assessments are confounded by measurements that are not intercomparable because they were made with different methods.
   Phytoplankton primary production along the continental margins is tightly linked to variability of water quality, biogeochemical processes including ocean-atmosphere CO2 exchange, and production at higher trophic levels including species we harvest as food. The empirical record has deficiencies that preclude reliable global assessment of this key Earth system process. We face two grand challenges to resolve these deficiencies: (1) organize and fund an international effort to use a common method and measure APPP regularly across a network of coastal sites that are globally representative and sustained over time, and (2) integrate data into a unifying model to explain the wide range of variability across ecosystems and to project responses of APPP to regional manifestations of global change as it continues to unfold.

AB During deepwater oil spill events, oil is released into a relatively stagnant environment (ocean water) in an uncontrolled manner. The oil phase initially emerges as a jet and the gushing oil loses its momentum energy and results in entrainment of surrounding water. The shear interaction between the oil mass and the ambient fluid results in generation of droplets with wide size distribution. In this study, we present a numerical model for predicting the droplet size distribution resulting from the interaction of turbulent oil jets with the surrounding quiescent environment. We achieve this objective by integrating traditional multiphase CFD models with a population balance approach. The developed model has been validated against the experimental observations reported in Johansen et al.([12]) The Mixture model' has been employed for evaluating flow fields in the system. We restrict our study to the atomization regime, where the droplet disintegration process has a greater significance over the competing coalescence mechanism. The population balance equation has been solved using the Class method' and the disintegration of droplets has been modelled by including the breakage kernel suggested by Lehr.(27) The developed model has been used to analyze the effect of dispersed (oil) phase flow rates, the presence of dispersants, and the presence of air in the jet phase on the overall size distribution of oil droplets. We also present a case which compares the droplet size distributions obtained by using the flow field evaluated by a more rigorous Eulerian Two-Fluid model over Mixture model.

   acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs); WVAM
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) use secondary velocity over ground measurements to aid the Inertial Navigation System (INS) to avoid unbounded drift in the point-to-point navigation solution. When operating in deep open ocean (i.e., in blue water-beyond the frequency-specific instrument range), the velocity measurements are either based on water column velocities or completely unavailable. In such scenarios, the velocity-relative-to-water measurements from an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) are often used for INS aiding. ADCPs have a blanking distance (typically ranging between 0.5 and 5 m) in proximity to the device in which the flow velocity data are undetectable. Hence, water velocities used to aid the INS solution can be significantly different from that near the vehicle and are subjected to significant noise. Previously, the authors introduced a nonacoustic method to calculate the water velocity components of a turbulent water column within the ADCP dead zone using the AUV motion response (referred to as the WVAM method). The current study analyzes the feasibility of incorporating the WVAM method within the INS by investigating the accuracy of it at different turbulence levels of the water column. Findings of this work demonstrate that the threshold limits of the method can be improved in the nonlinear ranges (i.e., at low and high levels of energy); however, by estimating a more accurate representation of vehicle hydrodynamic coefficients, this method has proven robust in a range of tidally induced flow conditions. The WVAM method, in its current state, offers significant potential to make a key contribution to blue water navigation when integrated within the vehicle's INS.

AB The stability of offshore wind turbines during operation is crucial, and as an emerging technology, the TetraSpar floating offshore wind turbine demonstrates commendable stability. Moreover, it can effectively reduce the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) in production and installation. However, There is relatively scarce research on its dynamic response and reliability under complex ocean conditions. To reduce the vibration response of floating offshore wind turbines in complex marine environments and improve the stability of the turbines, it is necessary to establish a fully coupled dynamic model to study the multi-field coupled dynamic response and vibration control of the turbines. In light of this, this paper establishes a multi-physical field coupled dynamic model for TetraSpar floating offshore wind turbine through an F2A coupling framework, integrating aerodynamics, servoelasticity, hydrodynamics, and mooring dynamics. The study analyzes the vibration suppression effects of different Tuned Mass Dampers (TMDs) on the wind turbine system. Using the two main response frequencies, 0.0367Hz and 0.57Hz, in the front and rear directions of the wind turbine as the tuning frequencies for TMD. The best vibration reduction effect was achieved by comparing multiple sets of TMD with different parameters. Analysis shows that TMD can significantly reduce the standard deviation of bending moment and tension of steel bars before and after tower foundation, with maximum values of 38.76% and 73.02%, respectively. At the same time, TMDs also impose a burden on wind turbines, such as a maximum increase of 2.23% in the average values of tower base bending moment, platform pitch, and tower top longitudinal displacement, which also slightly increase under extreme sea conditions. However, compared to the significant vibration suppression effect of TMD, it can be ignored.

AB While snow accumulation over central Greenland has been extensively studied, interannual variability of snowfall in the region is not well understood due to a dearth of observations. The Integrated Characterization of Energy, Clouds, Atmospheric state and Precipitation at Summit (ICECAPS) project at Summit, Greenland, offers a unique, ground-based opportunity to study precipitation in central Greenland where the surface mass balance is positive. Combining data from a Precipitation Occurrence Sensor System (POSS), Millimeter-wavelength Cloud Radar (MMCR), and snow stake field, the annual cycle of precipitation at Summit is examined. Average daily snowfall is higher by a factor of 3 from June to October compared to November to May, while surface height change is only higher by 15% during the same timeframes. This reduced variability in surface height is explained by the seasonally varying nature of latent heat flux, compaction, and wind contributions. The ICECAPS remote sensors and stake field measurements do not agree as far as total annual water equivalent. This discrepancy is likely due to a low bias in the POSS and MMCR snowfall retrievals for Summit. To further examine the seasonal cycle, snowfall measurements by the POSS were linked to local meteorological parameters, including wind direction, liquid water path (LWP), 2m temperature, and precipitable water vapor. An observed wind direction and moisture dependence are consistent with snowfall being linked to pulses of moist air that originate over nearby, ice-free ocean, a resource that becomes more readily available in summertime as the winter sea ice retreats. LWP is shown to have little relationship to snowfall, indicating that ice-phase precipitation processes are quite important for snowfall at Summit.

AB The seas and oceans are essential in preserving energy in the Earth, Ocean, and atmosphere system. Assessing past trends and expected sea surface temperature (SST) shifts is critical for future climate scenarios within this framework. Previous studies have emphasized the importance of SST in the emergence and intensification of heavy rainfall events in the South Asian basin and the development of heat waves in the coastal regions of South Asia. This study has focused to investigate the relationship between SST of the Arabian Sea and mean rainfall in South Asia using Singular Value Decomposition Analysis (SVDA) for the July, August, and September (JAS) season, as most of the region's rainfall is in this season. The first mode accounts for 69 % of the covariance between Arabian Sea SST and regional JAS rainfall, with three dominant SVDA modes explaining 96 % of the total squared covariance. The degree to which the connected fields are correlated has been investigated using Root Mean Squared Covariance. By heterogeneous correlation maps, it is concluded how significant is the impact of one field (SST) on the other (rainfall), which validates our hypothesis that the SST of the Arabian Sea affects variation in precipitation. The empirical results from the SVDA are consistent with those of the composite diagrams. Dry and wet years have been defined and analyzed to examine the impact of SST on regional JAS rainfall further. Vertically integrated moisture transport reveals a significant difference in moisture transport over the Arabian Sea between wet and dry years during the JAS season. Water vapor transport is much stronger during wet years compared to dry years.

ID SULFIDE; RETRIEVALS
AB Where does the carbon released by burning fossil fuels go? Currently, ocean and land systems remove about half of the CO2 emitted by human activities; the remainder stays in the atmosphere. These removal processes are sensitive to feedbacks in the energy, carbon, and water cycles that will change in the future. Observing how much carbon is taken up on land through photosynthesis is complicated because carbon is simultaneously respired by plants, animals, and microbes. Global observations from satellites and air samples suggest that natural ecosystems take up about as much CO2 as they emit. To match the data, our land models generate imaginary Earths where carbon uptake and respiration are roughly balanced, but the absolute quantities of carbon being exchanged vary widely. Getting the magnitude of the flux is essential to make sure our models are capturing the right pattern for the right reasons. Combining two cutting-edge tools, carbonyl sulfide (OCS) and solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), will help develop an independent answer of how much carbon is being taken up by global ecosystems. Photosynthesis requires CO2, light, and water. OCS provides a spatially and temporally integrated picture of the "front door" of photosynthesis, proportional to CO2 uptake and water loss through plant stomata. SIF provides a high-resolution snapshot of the "side door," scaling with the light captured by leaves. These two independent pieces of information help us understand plant water and carbon exchange. A coordinated effort to generate SIF and OCS data through satellite, airborne, and ground observations will improve our process-based models to predict how these cycles will change in the future.

AB Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow, elongated, synoptic jets of water vapor that play important roles in the global water cycle and meteorological/hydrological extremes. Increasing evidence shows that ARs have signatures and impacts in many regions across different continents. However, global-scale characterizations of AR representations in weather and climate models have been very limited. Using a recently developed AR detection algorithm oriented for global applications, the representation of AR activities in multidecade weather/climate simulations is evaluated. The algorithm is applied to 6-hourly (daily) integrated water vapor transport (IVT) from 22 (2) global weather/climate models that participated in the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment Atmospheric System Study-Year of Tropical Convection Multimodel Experiment, including four models with ocean-atmosphere coupling and two models with superparameterization. Multiple reanalysis products are used as references to help quantify model errors in the context of reanalysis uncertainty. Model performance is examined for key aspects of ARs (frequency, intensity, geometry, and seasonality), with the focus on identifying and understanding systematic errors in simulated ARs. The results highlight the range of model performances relative to reanalysis uncertainty in representing the most basic features of ARs. Among the 17 metrics considered, AR frequency, zonal IVT, fractional zonal circumference, fractional total meridional IVT, and three seasonality metrics have consistently large errors across all models. Possible connections between AR simulation qualities and aspects of model configurations are discussed. Despite the lack of a monotonic relationship, the importance of model horizontal resolution to the overall quality of AR simulation is suggested by the evaluation results.

AB Snowmelt is a critical component in the cryosphere and has a direct impact on Earth's energy and water budget. Here, a 40-yr integrated melt onset (MO) dataset over sea ice, ice sheets, and terrestrial snow is compiled from spaceborne microwave radiometers and ERA5, allowing an overall assessment of the cryosphere. Results suggest that MO in both hemispheres shows latitudinal and vertical zonalities. The global cryosphere presented a trend toward earlier MO (-2 days decade(-1)) with hotpots distributed at the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes where the warming rate is much higher than that at lower latitudes. Overall, variations in MO showed a similar pattern to that in near-surface temperature. The advance of MO has been slowing down since the 1990s and no significant trend was observed during the so-called warming hiatus period (1998-2012). Regionally, climatic linkage analyses suggest the local MO variations were associated with different climate indices. MO in the pan-Arctic region is related with the Arctic Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation, while that in the pan-Antarctic region is associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the southern annular mode. Occasionally, abnormal MO occurs as a result of extreme weather conditions. In February 2018, abnormal early melt events that occurred in the Arctic Ocean are found to be linked with the warm southerly flow due to sudden stratospheric warming. These findings suggest the satellite-based MO allows examining the dynamics and extremes in the climate system, both regionally and globally.

AB The abundance of microbial life and the sources of energy necessary for deep subsurface microbial communities remain enigmatic. Here we investigate deep microbial processes and their potential relationships to tectonic events in sediments from the Nankai Trough offshore Japan, drilled and sampled during IODP (Integrated Ocean Drilling Program) Expedition 316. Observed methane isotope profiles indicate that microbially mediated methane production occurs at Sites C0006 and C0007 in sediments below similar to 450 meters below seafloor (mbsf) and similar to 425 mbsf, respectively. The active carbon cycling in these deep subsurface sediments is likely related to the highly dynamic tectonic regime at Nankai Trough. We propose that transient increases in temperature have restimulated organic matter degradation at these distinct depths and explore several candidate processes for transient heating. Our favored hypothesis is frictional heating associated with earthquakes. In concert with transient heating leading to the reactivation of recalcitrant organic matter, the heterogeneous sedimentary system provides niches for microbial life. The newly available/accessible organic carbon compounds fuel the microbial community-resulting in an onset of methanogenesis several hundred meters below the seafloor. This process is captured in the methane C-isotope signal, showing the efficacy of methane C-isotopes for delineating locations of active microbial processes in deeply buried sediments. Additionally, simple model approaches applied to observed chemical pore water profiles can potentially constrain timing relationships, which can then be linked to causative tectonic events. Our results suggest the occurrence of slip-to-the-trench earthquake(s) 200-400 year ago, which could relate to historical earthquakes (1707 Hoei and/or 1605 Keicho earthquakes).

AB We examine the performance of our approach for calculating the total scattering coefficient of both non-absorbing and absorbing aerosol at ambient conditions from aircraft data. Our extended examination involves airborne in situ data collected by the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Gulf Stream 1 aircraft during winter over Cape Cod and the western North Atlantic Ocean as part of the Two-Column Aerosol Project (TCAP). The particle population represented by the winter dataset, in contrast with its summer counterpart, contains more hygroscopic particles and particles with an enhanced ability to absorb sunlight due to the larger fraction of black carbon. Moreover, the winter observations are characterized by more frequent clouds and a larger fraction of super-micron particles. We calculate model total scattering coefficient at ambient conditions using size spectra measured by optical particle counters (OPCs) and ambient complex refractive index (RI) estimated from measured chemical composition and relative humidity (RH). We demonstrate that reasonable agreement (similar to 20% on average) between the observed and calculated scattering can be obtained under subsaturated ambient conditions (RH < 80%) by applying both screening for clouds and chemical composition data for the RI-based correction of the OPC-derived size spectra.

AB The lithofacies architecture and depositional evolution of the Lower Mississippian (Tournaisian) Pekisko Formation in the subsurface of the Hawk Hills area in northwestern Alberta have been established by integrating detailed core work and well log data. The formation is composed of skeletal-peloidal limestones and argillaceous limestones that were deposited along the northern flank of the Peace River Embayment, a semi-restricted and tectonically active oceanic re-entrant located along the western margin of Laurasia at low paleolatitude. Lithofacies associations recognized in the study area include the outer ramp to slope (LA 1), outer ramp (LA 2) and mid ramp (LA 3), which are stacked into three decameter-scale, deepening-upward and aggradational cycles that are of regional extent and have meter-scale deepening and shallowing-upward trends. A previously unrecognized paleosol horizon at the top of decameter-scale cycle 2, indicating widespread subaerial exposure of the ramp, is interpreted as a sequence boundary that divides the Pekisko and Shunda formations in the study area (and possibly elsewhere in the Peace River Embayment) into two third-order sequences, each consisting of transgressive and highstand systems tracts. The Pekisko Formation in the study area is interpreted to represent a lowenergy, temperature-stratified ramp that was mainly homoclinal, but with transient, distal steepening occurring in the southern part of the study area. Ramp deposition was strongly affected by basement-fault reactivation causing differential subsidence and uplift in the Peace River Embayment. The paleogeography and paleoceanographic conditions of the embayment favored upwelling currents and development of a temperature-stratified ramp, as well as the formation of heterozoan carbonate deposits and mid ramp facies of predominantly packstones and wackestones. This depositional scenario is atypical, as most other documented examples of the Pekisko Formation and other Lower Mississippian ramp successions in western North America and western Europe are characterized by moderate to high-energy, mid to inner ramp facies deposited in open-ocean conditions. The results of this study contribute to an improved understanding of the range of depositional settings along the western margin of Laurasia during the Early Mississippian and demonstrate the applicability of the thermocline-stratified ramp model, with some modification, to ramps in semi-restricted embayments and other low energy settings.

AB The concentrated benthic suspension (CBS) of mud, as a major contributor of sediment transport in the turbidity maximum of the estuary, is of great challenge to be correctly monitored through field measurements, and its formation mechanism is not well understood. A tripod system equipped with multiple instruments was deployed to measure the near-bed hydrodynamics and sediments in the North Passage of the Changjiang Estuary, with the aim at determining the formation mechanisms of CBS. The measurements detected a significant dominance of high sediment concentration in the near-bed 1-m layer: 20g/L at the southern site and 47g/L at the northern site. Strong CBS occurred under weak tidal mixing condition and was directly relevant to the sediment-induced suppression of turbulent kinetic energy and the enhanced water stratification due to saltwater intrusion and sediment suspension. During the weak-mixing neap period, the typical thickness of CBS was about 0.2-0.3m, with a life time of 2.83hr (suspended-sediment concentration>15.0g/L). Enhanced water stratification reduced vertical mixing and confined the sediment entrainment from the near-bed layer to the upper column. This enhancement was due to the suppression of turbulent kinetic energy as a result of the sediment accumulation in the near-bottom column during the slack waterand also due to the appearance of a two-layer salinity structure in the vertical as a result of saltwater intrusion near the bottom. These physical processes worked as a positive feedback loop during the formation of CBS and can be simulated with a process-oriented, one-dimensional vertical CBS model.
   Plain Language Summary In the turbidity maximum, concentrated benthic suspension (CBS) frequently dominates the near-bed sediment transport, which, however, is difficult to be correctly observed, especially in the stratified condition. And the formation mechanism of CBS is complex due to the interaction of sediment and hydrodynamics. In a stratified tide channel of the Changjiang Estuary, China, a comprehensive tripod system, integrated with many cutting-edge instruments, is developed and deployed to measure the CBS and to determine the formation process. This system detected the existence of CBS in the lower near-bed 1-m layer, 20g/L at the southern site and 47g/L at the northern site, with the mean thickness of 20-30cm. The corresponding salinity, tidal velocities, wave, and turbulent kinetic energy were also recorded. During the formation of CBS, tidal mixing is weak. And the salinity/sediment-induced stratification greatly limits the vertical mixing and suppresses the turbulent kinetic energy production. The saltwater intrusion creates a two-layer structure of salinity, leading to stratification and decreasing the mixing. These physical effects work like a positive feedback loop. A one-dimensional vertical model had been developed to successfully simulate the formation process of CBS, indicating the stable CBS during weak-tidal-mixing neap cycle.

AB Understanding the relative roles of species interactions and environmental factors in structuring communities has historically focused on local scales where manipulative experiments are possible. However, recent interest in predicting the effects of climate change and species invasions has spurred increasing attention to processes occurring at larger spatial and temporal scales. The "meta-ecosystem" approach is an ideal framework for integrating processes operating at multiple scales as it explicitly considers the influence of local biotic interactions and regional flows of energy, materials, and organisms on community structure. Using a comparative-experimental design, we asked (1) what is the relative importance of local biotic interactions and oceanic processes in determining rocky intertidal community structure in the low zone within the Northern California Current System, and (2) what factors are most important in regulating this structure and why? We focused on functional group interactions between macrophytes and sessile invertebrates and their consumers (grazers, predators), how these varied across spatial scales, and with ocean-driven conditions (upwelling, temperature) and ecological subsidies (nutrients, phytoplankton, sessile invertebrate recruits). Experiments were conducted at 13 sites divided across four capes in Oregon and northern California. Results showed that biotic interactions were variable in space and time but overall, sessile invertebrates had no effect on macrophytes while macrophytes had weakly negative effects on sessile invertebrates. Consumers, particularly predators, also had weakly negative effects on both functional groups. Overall, we found that 40-49% of the variance in community structure at the local scale was explained by external factors (e.g., spatial scale, time, upwelling, temperature, ecological subsidies) vs. 19-39% explained by functional group interactions. When individual functional group interaction strengths were used, only 2-3% of the variation was explained by any one functional group while 28-54% of the variation was explained by external factors. We conclude that community structure in the low intertidal zone is driven primarily by external factors at the regional scale with local biotic interactions playing a secondary role.

AB Impacts of the AMOC on the mean state of the North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) are investigated by implementing two seawater equations of state (EOS), the standard EOS and the "stiffened " EOS, into an earth system model (ESM). The ESM using the "stiffened " EOS improves the performance of the simulated AMOC. Moreover, the "stiffened " EOS significantly increases the SST in the northern tropical Atlantic (NTA) and northern North Atlantic (NNA) regions. Singular value decomposition analyses reveal that the AMOC changes exert important influences on the SST changes in the NTA and NNA regions. The enhanced AMOC intensifies the volume-integrated meridional heat transport, which dominates the SST warming in the NNA region. Physical processes responsible for the NTA SST changes are more complicated. Regarding the net surface heat flux, it plays an inverse role in modulating SST changes in the NTA region. The net surface heat flux dampens SST changes in the northern NTA region and favors SST changes in the southern NTA region. Influenced by the local and remote SST heating, we find that an anomalous southeasterly appears over the tropical North Atlantic in the simulation with the "stiffened " EOS, which increases the SST in the NTA region through the wind-evaporation-SST mechanism. Concerning the oceanic processes, the enhanced AMOC weakens the subtropical cell in the North Atlantic. Moreover, the enhanced deep convection downward transports the warm surface water in the NNA region to the deep ocean; then the well-mixed warm deep water is southward transported. When reaching the tropical North Atlantic the warm deep water is upward convected by the diapycnal mixing and is eventually upwelled to the sea surface by the enhanced cyclonic winds. The mixed-layer heat budget analysis shows that the NTA SST changes are mainly attributed to the changes in the zonal advection and vertical convection of the seawater temperature.

AB Phosphorus (P) concentrations in sediments are frequently used to reconstruct past environmental conditions in freshwater and marine systems, with high values thought to be indicative of a high biological productivity. Recent studies suggest that the post-depositional formation of vivianite, an iron(II)-phosphate mineral, might significantly alter trends in P with sediment depth. To assess its importance, we investigate a sediment record from the Bornholm Basin that was retrieved during the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Baltic Sea Paleoenvironment Expedition 347 in 2013, consisting of lake sediments overlain by brackish-marine deposits. Combining bulk sediment geochemistry with microanalysis using scanning electron microscope energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), we demonstrate that vivianite-type minerals rich in manganese and magnesium are present in the lake deposits just below the transition to the brackish-marine sediments (at 11.5 to 12 m sediment depth). In this depth interval, phosphate that diffuses down from the organic-rich, brackish-marine sediments meets porewaters rich in dissolved iron in the lake sediments, resulting in the precipitation of iron(II) phosphate. Results from a reactive transport model suggest that the peak in iron(II) phosphate originally occurred at the lake-marine transition (9 to 10 m) and moved downwards due to changes in the depth of a sulfidization front. However, its current position relative to the lake-marine transition is stable as the vivianite-type minerals and active sulfidization fronts have been spatially separated over time. Experiments in which vivianite was subjected to sulfidic conditions demonstrate that incorporation of manganese or magnesium in vivianite does not affect its susceptibility to sulfide-induced dissolution. Our work highlights that post-depositional formation of iron(II) phosphates such as vivianite has the potential to strongly alter sedimentary P records particularly in systems that are subject to environmental perturbation, such as a change in primary productivity, which can be associated with a lake-marine transition.

ID CLIMATE SIMULATIONS; RADIATION CALCULATIONS; MODEL; LONGWAVE; ACCURATE;

AB Radiation schemes are physically important but computationally expensive components of weather and climate models. This has spurred efforts to replace them with a cheap emulator based on neural networks (NNs), obtaining large speed-ups, but at the expense of accuracy, energy conservation and generalization. An alternative approach, which is slower but more robust than full emulation, is to use NNs to predict optical properties but keep the radiative transfer equations. Recently, NNs were developed to replace the RRTMGP (Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for General circulation model applications-Parallel) gas optics scheme and shown to be accurate while improving speed. However, the evaluations were based solely on offline radiation computations.In this paper, we describe the implementation and prognostic evaluation of RRTMGP-NN in the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The new gas optics scheme was incorporated into ecRad, the modular ECMWF radiation scheme. Using two new methods to improve accuracy - a hybrid loss function designed to reduce radiative forcing errors and an early stopping method based on monitoring fluxes and heating rates with respect to a line-by-line benchmark - we train NN models on RRTMGP k distributions with reduced spectral resolutions. Offline evaluation of the new NN gas optics, RRTMGP-NN 2.0, shows a very high level of accuracy for clear-sky fluxes and heating rates. For instance, the RMSE in the shortwave surface downwelling flux is 0.78 W m-2 for RRTMGP and 0.80 W m-2 for RRTMGP-NN in a present-day scenario, while upwelling flux errors are actually smaller for the NN. Because our approach does not affect the treatment of clouds, no additional errors will be introduced for cloudy profiles. RRTMGP-NN closely reproduces radiative forcings for five important greenhouse gases across a wide range of concentrations such as 8xCO(2).To assess the impact of different gas optics schemes in the IFS, four 1-year coupled ocean-atmosphere simulations were performed for each configuration. The results show that RRTMGP-NN and RRTMGP produce very similar model climates, with the differences being smaller than those between existing schemes and statistically insignificant for zonal means of single-level quantities such as surface temperature. The use of RRTMGP-NN speeds up ecRad by a factor of 1.5 compared to RRTMGP (the gas optics being almost 3 times faster) and is also faster than the older and less accurate RRTMG, which is used in the current operational cycle of the IFS.

AB This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400-1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO(2) to more than 120 GtCO(2) per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6 W/m(2) that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2 degrees C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).

AB The Changjiang Delta (CD) is one of well-studied large deltas of critical socio-economical and ecological importance regionally and global representativeness. Cumulated field data and numerical modeling has facilitated scientific understanding of its hydro-morphodynamics at multiple spatial and time scales, but the changing boundary forcing conditions and increasing anthropogenic influences pose management challenges requiring integrated knowledge. Here we provide a comprehensive synthesis of the multi-scale deltaic hydromorphodynamics, discuss their relevance and management perspectives in a global context, and identify knowledge gaps for future study. The CD is classified as a river-tide mixed-energy, muddy and highly turbid, fluvio-deltaic composite system involving large-scale land-ocean interacted processes. Its hydro-morphodynamic evolution exhibits profound temporal variations at the fortnightly, seasonal, and inter-annual time scales, and strong spatial variability between tidal river and tidal estuary, and between different distributary channels. As the river-borne sediment has declined >70%, the deltaic morphodynamic adaptation lags behind sediment decline because sediment redistribution within the delta emerges to play a role in sustaining tidal flat accretion. However, the deltaic channels have become narrower, deepened and growingly constrained under cumulated human activities, e.g., extensive embankment and construction of jetties and groins, possibly initiating a decrease in morphodynamic activities and sediment trapping efficiency. Overall, the CD undergoes transitions from net sedimentation and naturally slow morphodynamic adaptation to erosion and human-driven radical adjustment. A shift in management priority from delta development to ecosystem conservation provides an opportunity for restoring the resilience to flooding and erosion hazards. The lessons and identified knowledge gaps inform study and management of worldwide estuaries and deltas undergoing intensified human interferences.

AB Anticyclonic (warm-core) mesoscale eddies (WCEs) in the Eastern Indian Ocean carry higher surface chlorophyll signatures than cyclonic (cold-core) eddies (CCEs). Paradoxically, WCEs host rock lobster larvae (phyllosomas) with lower lipid stores and protein reserves than phyllosomas in CCEs, suggesting a poorer nutritional status. We assess primary productivity and zooplankton isotopic data from eight eddies across four research voyages (2003-2011) to determine how this contradiction might occur. We find that WCEs and CCEs are equally productive per unit chlorophyll a, but depth-integrated primary production (PP) is greater in eddies with shallower mixed layers (MLs), especially in CCEs. MLs tend to be shallower in CCEs than in WCEs because the pycnocline is closer to the surface. This, in combination with stronger stratification in CCE euphotic zones than those of WCEs, supports greater flagellate and dinoflagellate populations in CCEs. These phytoplankton provide high-quality nutrition for zooplankton, which feed on average ~ 0.6 trophic level lower in CCEs with the shallowest MLs, accumulating high lipid stores. Conversely, WCEs have, on average, ~ 70 m deeper MLs than CCEs, and host a phytoplankton community with more diatoms. Diatoms provide lower quality food for zooplankton, and zooplankton lipid stores in WCEs decline with trophic level, and possibly, with time after initial (or seasonal) nutrient injection. As a result, phyllosomas in CCEs have higher energy and lipid content than those in warm-core eddies. The resolution of the paradox, therefore, is that the higher surface chlorophyll signatures of WCEs are not representative of the nutritional value of the prey field of the phyllosoma. We also conclude that interannual variations of mixed layer depth occur at a regional scale, controlling PP.

AB This study monitored 37 longliners fishing in waters near the Marshall Islands from 2020 to 2022 by Liancheng Overseas Fishery (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd.'s operation management system. This study developed nine predictive models on the relationship between catch per unit effort (CPUE) data for yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and the environmental data. The environmental data integrate 48 variables, including eddy kinetic energy, chlorophyll a concentration, sea surface height, and additional measures of vertical oceanic conditions, alongside spatiotemporal parameters (year, month, day, longitude, and latitude). This study employed four spatial resolutions (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees, 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees, 1 degrees x 1 degrees, and 2 degrees x 2 degrees) to develop nine predictive models: KNN, RF, GBDT, CART, LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, AdaBoost, and Stacking (RF, KNN, GBDT, and LR). These models, with a daily time resolution, were trained using 75% of the data and tested with the remaining 25%. The optimal spatial resolution and model were determined through a comprehensive comparison of model evaluation metrics across these spatial resolutions. The SMOTETomek algorithm was then applied to resample 75% of the data at the optimal spatial resolution, forming a new training dataset. This dataset was used to refine the model, subsequently tested with the remaining 25% of the data. Results indicated that (1) the optimal spatial resolution is 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees and the optimal model is RF; (2) the SMOTETomek algorithm enhances the model's predictive performance; and (3) the developed SMK-RF model, exhibiting Acc and AUC values of 76.73% and 82.47%, respectively, accurately predicts the central fishing grounds for yellowfin tuna, consisting closely with actual fishing activity.

AB Ancient shoreline-shelf depositional systems are influenced by an unusually wide array of geological, biological and hydrodynamic processes, with sediment transport and deposition primarily determined by the interaction of river, wave (including storm) and tidal processes, and changes in relative sea level. Understanding the impact of these processes on shoreline-shelf morphodynamics and stratigraphic preservation remains challenging. Numerical modelling integrated with traditional facies analysis provides an increasingly viable approach, with the potential to quantify, and thereby improve understanding of, the impact of these complex coastal sedimentary processes. An integrated approach is presented here that focuses on palaeotidal modelling to investigate the controls on ancient tides and their influence on sedimentary deposition and preservation - one of the three cornerstones of the ternary process classification scheme of shoreline-shelf systems. Numerical tidal modelling methodology is reviewed and illustrated in three palaeotidal model case studies of different scales and focus. The results are synthesised in the context of shoreline-shelf processes, including a critique and modification of the process-based classification scheme. The emphasis on tidal processes reflects their global importance throughout Earth's history. Ancient palaeotidal models are able to highlight and quantify the following four controls on tidal processes: (1) the physiography (shape and depth) of oceans (1000s km scale) determines the degree of tidal resonance; (2) the physiography of ocean connections to partly enclosed water bodies (100-1000s km scale) determines the regional-scale flux of tidal energy (inflow versus outflow); (3) the physiography of continental shelves influences shelf tidal resonance potential; and (4) tides in relatively local-scale embayments (typically 1-10s km scale) are influenced by the balance of tidal amplification due to funnelling, shoaling and resonance effects versus frictional damping. In deep time, palaeogeographic and palaeobathymetric uncertainty can be accounted for in palaeotidal models by performing sensitivity analyses to different scenarios, across this range of spatial scales. These tidal process controls are incorporated into an updated predictive decision tree for determining shoreline-shelf process regime in terms of the relative interaction of wave, fluvial and tidal processes. The predictive decision tree considers the effects of basin physiography, shelf width and shoreline morphology on wave, fluvial and tidal processes separately. Uncertainty and ambiguity in applying the widely used three-tier process classification scheme are reduced by using the decision tree in conjunction with a proposed two-tier classification of process regime that is limited to primary and secondary processes. This two-tier classification scheme is illustrated in the three case studies, showing how integration of numerical modelling with facies analysis of the preserved stratigraphic record improves confidence in prediction of tide-influenced shoreline-shelf process regimes. Wider application of this approach will further improve process-based classifications and predictions of modern and ancient shoreline-shelf systems.

TI Near-real-time CO2 fluxes from CarbonTracker Europe for

AB We present the CarbonTracker Europe High-Resolution (CTE-HR) system that estimates carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange over Europe at high resolution (0.1 x 0.2(?degrees)) and in near real time (about 2 months' latency). It includes a dynamic anthropogenic emission model, which uses easily available statistics on economic activity, energy use, and weather to generate anthropogenic emissions with dynamic time profiles at high spatial and temporal resolution (0.1x0.2 degrees(,) hourly). Hourly net ecosystem productivity (NEP) calculated by the Simple Biosphere model Version 4 (SiB4) is driven by meteorology from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis 5th Generation (ERA5) dataset. This NEP is downscaled to 0.1x0.2 degrees using the high-resolution Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) land-cover map and combined with the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) fire emissions to create terrestrial carbon fluxes. Ocean CO2 fluxes are included in our product, based on Jena CarboScope ocean CO2 fluxes, which are downscaled using wind speed and temperature. Jointly, these flux estimates enable modeling of atmospheric CO2 mole fractions over Europe.
   We assess the skill of the CTE-HR CO2 fluxes (a) to reproduce observed anomalies in biospheric fluxes and atmospheric CO2 mole fractions during the 2018 European drought, (b) to capture the reduction of anthropogenic emissions due to COVID-19 lockdowns, (c) to match mole fraction observations at Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) sites across Europe after atmospheric transport with the Transport Model, version 5 (TM5) and the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT), driven by ECMWF-IFS, and (d) to capture the magnitude and variability of measured CO2 fluxes in the city center of Amsterdam (the Netherlands).
   We show that CTE-HR fluxes reproduce large-scale flux anomalies reported in previous studies for both biospheric fluxes (drought of 2018) and anthropogenic emissions (COVID-19 pandemic in 2020). After applying transport of emitted CO2, the CTE-HR fluxes have lower median root mean square errors (RMSEs) relative to mole fraction observations than fluxes from a non-informed flux estimate, in which biosphere fluxes are scaled to match the global growth rate of CO2 (poor person's inversion). RMSEs are close to those of the reanalysis with the CTE data assimilation system. This is encouraging given that CTE-HR fluxes did not profit from the weekly assimilation of CO2 observations as in CTE.
   We furthermore compare CO2 concentration observations at the Dutch Lutjewad coastal tower with high-resolution STILT transport to show that the high-resolution fluxes manifest variability due to different emission sectors in summer and winter. Interestingly, in periods where synoptic-scale transport variability dominates CO2 concentration variations, the CTE-HR fluxes perform similarly to low-resolution fluxes (5-10x coarsened). The remaining 10 % of the simulated CO2 mole fraction differs by > 2 ppm between the low-resolution and high-resolution flux representation and is clearly associated with coherent structures ("plumes") originating from emission hotspots such as power plants. We therefore note that the added resolution of our product will matter most for very specific locations and times when used for atmospheric CO2 modeling. Finally, in a densely populated region like the Amsterdam city center, our modeled fluxes underestimate the magnitude of measured eddy covariance fluxes but capture their substantial diurnal variations in summertime and wintertime well.
   We conclude that our product is a promising tool for modeling the European carbon budget at a high resolution in near real time. The fluxes are freely available from the ICOS Carbon Portal (CC-BY-4.0) to be used for near-real-time monitoring and modeling, for example, as an a priori flux product in a CO2 data assimilation system. The data are available at https://doi.org/10.18160/20Z1-AYJ2 (van der Woude, 2022a).

AB The Bangladesh lowlands are traversed by the largest sediment flux on the planet. Detritus generated mostly in Himalayan highlands and conveyed through the Ganga-Brahmaputra rivers and Meghna estuary reaches the Bay of Bengal, where it forms a composite deltaic system. This study integrates the vast existing database on Ganga-Brahmaputra sediments of all grain sizes from clay to sand with new petrographic, mineralogical, and geochemical data on estuarine and shallow-marine sands. A large spectrum of compositional signatures was used to: (i) assess the relative supply of the Ganga and Brahmaputra rivers to estuarine and shelfal sediments; (ii) define the compositional variability of estuarine sediments and the impact exerted by hydraulic sorting and climate-related chemical weathering on provenance signals; (iii) define the compositional variability of shelf sediments and the potential hydrodynamic segregation of fast-settling heavy minerals in coastal environments and of slow-settling platy micas on low-energy outer-shelf floors; (iv) consider the potential additional mud supply from the western subaerial part of the delta formerly built by the Ganga River; and (v) draw a preliminary mineralogical comparison between fluvio-deltaic sediments and turbidites of the Bengal-Nicobar deep-sea fan, thus tracing sediment dispersal across the huge sedimentary system extending from Tibet to the equatorial Indian Ocean. All investigated mineralogical and geochemical parameters, as well as Sr and Nd isotope ratios and clay-mineral assemblages, showed a clear prevalence in sediment supply from the Brahmaputra (60-70%) over the Ganga (30-40%). Heavy-mineral suites and Sr and Nd isotope fingerprints of Bengal shelf sediments are nearly identical to those of the Brahmaputra River and Meghna estuary, also because the Brahmaputra carries almost twice as many Ca-plagioclase grains and heavy minerals including epidote than the Ganga, and these minerals control the large majority of the Sr and Nd budgets. The experience gained in modern settings can be directly extrapolated only to the recent past, because sediments older than the late Pleistocene and buried more than a few hundred meters begin to lose less durable ferromagnesian minerals by selective chemical dissolution, which makes quantitative estimates progressively less robust in more deeply buried older strata.

AB A new methodology is developed to construct a global (60 degrees S-60 degrees N) long-term (2000-2019) high-resolution (similar to 10-km h) mesoscale convective system (MCS) database by tracking MCS jointly using geostationary satellite infrared brightness temperature (T-b) and precipitation feature (PF) characteristics from the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM precipitation data sets. Independent validation shows that the satellite-based MCS data set is able to reproduce important MCS statistics derived from ground-based radar network observations in the United States and China. We show that by carefully considering key PF characteristics in addition to T-b signatures, the new method significantly improves upon previous T-b-only methods in detecting MCSs in the midlatitudes for all seasons. Results show that MCSs account for over 50% of annual total rainfall across most of the tropical belt and in selected regions of the midlatitudes, with a strong seasonality over many regions of the globe. The tracking database allows Lagrangian aspects such as MCS lifetime and translational speed and direction to be analyzed. The longest-lived MCSs preferentially occur over the subtropical oceans. The land MCSs have higher cloud-tops associated with more intense convection, and oceanic MCSs have much higher rainfall production. While MCSs are observed in many regions of the globe, there are fundamental differences in their dynamic and thermodynamic structures that warrant a better understanding of processes that control their evolution. This global database provides significant opportunities for observational and modeling studies of MCSs, their characteristics, and roles in regional and global water and energy cycles, as well as their hydrologic and other impacts.
   Plain Language Summary Convective storms of mesoscale dimension are a key component in the Earth's energy and hydrological cycle. Mesoscale storms grow to hundreds of kilometers in size and can last for more than a day, and produce a majority of the annual rainfall in many regions of the world. Past studies of mesoscale storms have been limited to the tropics and used methodologies not well tested in the midlatitudes. Here, we develop a new methodology to track mesoscale storms globally using high-resolution satellite observations of both cloud and precipitation. The satellite-based storm tracking reproduces important storm statistics derived from ground-based radar observations. Our new method significantly improves the detection of mesoscale storms in the midlatitudes. This new storm tracking database is the first to cover both the tropics and midlatitudes for all seasons. Results show that mesoscale convective storms account for over 50% of annual rainfall across the tropics and many regions of the subtropics and midlatitudes. Storms over land have more intense convection, while those over ocean produce heavier rainfall and last longer. This global mesoscale storms tracking database supports a broad range of applications, such as understanding their role in global extreme rainfall and circulation and evaluation of global weather and climate model simulations.
   Key Points
   Develop an algorithm to track mesoscale convective systems globally using satellite infrared brightness temperature and precipitation data
   Satellite-based tracking reproduces mesoscale convective system statistics derived from tracking using ground-based radar network data

AB Since June, 2018, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On (GRACE-FO) is extending the 15-year monthly mass change record of the GRACE mission, which ended in June 2017. The GRACE-FO instrument and flight system performance has improved over GRACE. Better attitude solutions and enhanced pointing performance result in reduced fuel consumption and gravity range rate post-fit residuals. One accelerometer requires additional calibrations due to unexpected measurement noise. The GRACE-FO gravity and mass change fields from June 2018 through December 2019 continue the GRACE record at an equivalent precision and spatiotemporal sampling. During this period, GRACE-FO observed large interannual terrestrial water variations associated with excess rainfall (Central US, Middle East), drought (Europe, Australia), and ice melt (Greenland). These observations are consistent with independent mass change estimates, providing high confidence that no intermission biases exist from GRACE to GRACE-FO, despite the 11-month gap. GRACE-FO has also successfully demonstrated satellite-to-satellite laser ranging interferometry.
   Plain Language Summary Mass change is a fundamental climate system indicator and provides an integrated global view of how Earth's water cycle and energy balance are evolving. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission monitored mass changes every month from 2002 through 2017. Since June 2018, GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) continues this data record, tracking and monitoring changes in ice sheets and glaciers, near-surface and underground water storage, as well as changes in sea level and ocean currents. GRACE-FO instruments have been successfully calibrated and are providing new monthly mass change observations at a consistent spatial resolution and data quality with GRACE. Since its launch, GRACE-FO has measured record land water storage changes in 2018 and 2019 in response to extreme heat waves and droughts over Europe and Australia, as well as to extreme rainfall events over the United States and Middle East. In the summer of 2019, GRACE-FO measured record-level Greenland mass loss rates. A novel laser ranging interferometer was successfully demonstrated on GRACE-FO, laying the groundwork for improved future satellite gravity observations.

AB Marine red beds (MRBs) are often attributed to specific redox environments during syndepositional and early diagenetic phases. During the Middle Ordovician, a succession of reddish, deeper-water nodular argillaceous limestones (i.e., Zitai and Kuniutan formations) were deposited along the margin of Yangtze Platform in South China. However, the origin of their color remains enigmatic. In this study, we investigated the Middle Ordovician MRBs from a borehole core newly drilled in the Lower Yangtze area of South China whose stratigraphy frameworks are constrained by carbon isotope and biostratigraphy. This study investigates the pigmentation of these MRBs by integrating petrographic observations, elemental geochemistry, diffusive reflectance spectrometry (DRS), and scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS). DRS results show that the red pigment is caused by hematite particles in submicron- to micron-level size. SEM demonstrates that the hematite grains are either detrital grains with traces of physical transport from terrestrial source, or flaky amorphous hematite aggregates situated within the calcite crystal interstices, implicating both syndepositional and early diagenetic origins, respectively. In terms of the geochemical result of the bulk rocks, the close positive correlation between Al2O3 and Fe2O3 indicates that the iron pigment materials may mainly originate from terrestrial Fe-bearing phyllosilicates. These observations are also consistent with the distribution patterns of rare earth elements (REEs) in carbonate leachates. The MRB limestones are characterized by MREE-bulged patterns and close to similar to 1 Ce anomalies, suggesting active reductive dissolution and subsequent reprecipitation of iron oxides during diagenesis in pore systems. This study proposes that the coloration of Middle Ordovician MRBs in Lower Yangtze Platform was linked to the enhanced input of terrestrial clay minerals rich in iron. The reductive dissolution released iron ions from terrestrial detrital and allowed subsequent reprecipitation of iron-oxides in pore water system during the fluid-buffered diagenesis. In this light, hematites formed during both the syndepositional and diagenetic processes thus could have involved the coloration of the Middle Ordovician carbonate red beds in this case.

AB High-energy events in the Caribbean Sea include hurricanes, tropical storms, cold fronts and tsunamis. El Rosario Archipelago, located on the Colombian Caribbean shelf (SW Caribbean) consists of a set of ancient and successive coralline formations, uplifted by tectonic and diapiric activity. We undertook an integrated analysis of instrumental climate records and sediment records from a beach ridge system, a reef lagoon and a mangrove lagoon in the Archipelago, to determine whether historical extreme weather events influenced the coastal geomorphology and reef sedimentation. Statistical analysis of historical extreme winds and waves was accomplished using ERA-Interim reanalysis data. Extreme sea-level events were identified with calibrated data from the nearest tide gauge. Sediments from the reef and mangrove lagoon were dated using Pb-210 and C-14 Beach ridges were dated indirectly thorough their relationship with the closure of the mangrove lagoon. The eroding capacity of the historical extreme waves (i.e. maximum grain size that could be entrained by the orbital velocity of the waves) was compared with the grain sizes present in the deposits, and foraminifera species helped to determine the provenance of those deposits. Storms typically occur during the dry season associated with cold fronts. Foraminifera and coral fragments indicated that beach ridges were supplied with sediment that eroded from ancient terraces. In the reef lagoon, a 56-cm-thick unit of coarse coral and shell debris, grading to a finer sediment, represents a major high-energy event that occurred after ca. 1655 CE. This event was also recorded by the beach ridges. The probable explanation for this high energy unit is that a strong event carried coarse sediments into the lagoon, with subsequent reworking by minor events, such as those reported in the historical record. Two tsunamis occurred in the Caribbean after 1655, but the associated waves reaching the area were not strong enough to deposit the coarser clasts of the unit. Thus, coarser material was probably delivered to the lagoon as a consequence of sudden diapiric and/or tectonic activity. Our data show that major storms and other high-wind, extreme-wave events shape the beach ridges on Rosario Island, every 70 years. The findings suggest that if global climate change increases the frequency and/or magnitude of major storms and other high-wind, extreme wave events that impact the Caribbean coast of Colombia, then El Rosario Archipelago will be susceptible to future, significant landscape transformations.

AB Elasticity is one of the most fundamental mechanical properties of solid. In high-throughput design of advanced materials, there is an imperative demand for the capability to quickly calculate and screen a massive pool of candidate structures. A fully automatized pipeline with minimal human intervention is the key to provide high efficiency to achieve the goal. Here, we introduce a tool-kit MyElas that aims to address this problem by forging all pre-processing, elastic constant and other related property calculations, and post-processing into an integrated framework that automatically performs the assigned tasks to drive data flowing through parallelized pipelines from input to output. The core of MyElas is to calculate the second and third order elastic constants of a solid with the energy-strain method from first-principles. MyElas can auto-analyze the elastic constants, to derive other related physical quantities. Furthermore, the tool-kit also integrates a visualization function, which can, for example, plot the spatial anisotropy of elastic modulus and sound velocity of monocrystalline. The validity and efficiency of the toolkit are tested and bench-marked on several typical systems. Program summary Program title: MyElas CPC Library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /jbz2s9xsmv.1 Code Ocean capsule: https://codeocean .com /capsule /4149434 Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License 3 Programming language: Python 3.X External routines/libraries: Numpy [1], Spglib [2], Matplotlib [3] Nature of problem: Through the first-principal calculation, the second-order and third-order elastic constants of solid materials are automatically calculated, and the post-processing and visualization of single crystal and polycrystalline physical properties are carried out. Solution method: Firstly, the required strain structure is automatically generated through the space group of materials and the corresponding strain matrix. Secondly, the energy of the structure is calculated by first-principles calculation software such as VASP [4]. Thirdly, the relationship between energy and strain is polynomial fitted to deduce the elastic constant of the material. Fourth, automatically derive the relevant physical properties. Finally, the distribution of mechanical modulus and sound velocity in spherical space is visualized. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: Many modules of the software can be embedded into other software through simple modification, such as visualization module. The software supports finite temperature calculation with electronic temperature. In addition, the software supports the derivation of corresponding elastic constants from phonon spectrum data generated by Phonopy [5], Alamode [6] and TDEP [7] software through long-wave limit approximation and Christoffel equation.

AB Soil erosion, physical transport of soil over the landscape by alluvial and aeolian processes as source of energy, has a strong impact on the global carbon cycle (GCC). Being a light fraction (bulk density of 0.6-0.8 Mg/m(3)) and concentrated in vicinity of soil surface, soil organic carbon (SOC) is preferentially removed by water and wind erosion. The process of erosion and the attendant transport of SOC are accelerated by conversion of natural to agroecosystems. Whereas the human-induced acceleration of soil erosion has depleted the SOC stock of agroecosystems, the fate of SOC transported over the landscape and that deposited in depressional sites is not understood. While a fraction of SOC transported to and buried under aquatic ecosystems (e.g., flood plains, lakes, ocean) may be protected because of limited microbial activity, labile fractions of SOC being transported over the landscape enroute to the depositional site are vulnerable to decomposition. Depending on the site-specific conditions with regards to the hydrothermal regimes and the degree of aeration, the decomposition may lead to emission of CO2 under aerobic environments, CH4 under anaerobic conditions, and N2O under both situations. The process of soil erosion, especially that by water, is a 4-stage process: (i) detachment, (ii) splash, (iii) transport and redistribution, and (iv) deposition. Breakdown of aggregates, during the first three stages, exposes the hitherto encapsulated SOC to microbial processes and exacerbates its vulnerability to decomposition. Thus, the fate of SOC subject to erosion must be assessed for all landscape positions and integrated over the watershed. Lack of credible data regarding the fate of SOC at different erosional stages is a major cause of uncertainties. Thus, well-planned research at a watershed-level is needed to assess the impacts of erosional processes on decomposition of SOC, gaseous emission, and the soil/ecosystem C budget for diverse soils and management systems in global biomes/ecoregions. The data on global C budget is incomplete without consideration of the impact of erosion on SOC and the attendant gaseous emissions.

AB Due to the local and natural characteristics of high latitude and altitude in the Three Polar Region (TPR)-that is, the Antarctic, the Arctic, and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP)-this region has been significantly affected by climate change and related disasters. Thus, the sustainable development pathway for the TPR is different from that of other regions. The Antarctic region, as a public territory, experiences sustainability problems that are mainly the result of the integrated impact of tourism and scientific and commercial fishing activities on the continent and ocean. Understanding how to build a shared, co-built, and co-governed, legally binding and equal international multilateral partnership or treaty, and thereby reducing the impact on water life and on land life, is the key pathway to achieving the Antarctic sustainable development goals (SDGs). The Arctic region has both a high level of development at the national level and a low level of development within the country, including the livelihood of indigenous people. Learning how to effectively deal with the domestic development imbalance in the future is a key pathway to achieving Arctic SDGs. The QTP has a fragile ecology and a single industry. As a relatively poor area in China, the ability to promote ecological protection and improve people's welfare through ecological policies is a key pathway to achieving the SDGs in the QTP. At the same time, the TPR also needs to enhance its climate resilience through climate action to mitigate the impacts of climate change. On this basis, to fully achieve the SDGs in support of the TPR, it is necessary to establish and pursue multilateral cooperation in science research, infrastructure, commerce, energy, and mining trades. As an important part of the climate system, spatial and temporal changes in the TPR have direct and indirect impacts on the global climate and other spheres (e.g., Anthroposphere) and also affect the global sustainable development process. Therefore, through the TPR's linkage and multilateral cooperation, the region can simultaneously enter the global sustainable development track.

AB Sea-level rise associated with changing climate is expected to pose a major challenge for societies. Based on the efforts of COP21 to limit global warming to 2.0 degrees C or even 1.5 degrees C by the end of the 21st century (Paris Agreement), we simulate the future contribution of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) to sea-level change under the low emission Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 scenario. The Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) with higher-order approximation is used and initialized with a hybrid approach of spin-up and data assimilation. For three general circulation models (GCMs: HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIROC5) the projections are conducted up to 2300 with forcing fields for surface mass balance (SMB) and ice surface temperature (T-s) computed by the surface energy balance model of intermediate complexity (SEMIC). The projected sea-level rise ranges between 21-38 mm by 2100 and 36-85 mm by 2300. According to the three GCMs used, global warming will exceed 1.5 degrees C early in the 21st century. The RCP2.6 peak and decline scenario is therefore manually adjusted in another set of experiments to suppress the 1.5 degrees C overshooting effect. These scenarios show a sea-level contribution that is on average about 38% and 31% less by 2100 and 2300, respectively. For some experiments, the rate of mass loss in the 23rd century does not exclude a stable ice sheet in the future. This is due to a spatially integrated SMB that remains positive and reaches values similar to the present day in the latter half of the simulation period. Although the mean SMB is reduced in the warmer climate, a future steady-state ice sheet with lower surface elevation and hence volume might be possible. Our results indicate that uncertainties in the projections stem from the underlying GCM climate data used to calculate the surface mass balance. However, the RCP2.6 scenario will lead to significant changes in the GrIS, including elevation changes of up to 100 m. The sea-level contribution estimated in this study may serve as a lower bound for the RCP2.6 scenario, as the currently observed sea-level rise is not reached in any of the experiments; this is attributed to processes (e.g. ocean forcing) not yet represented by the model, but proven to play a major role in GrIS mass loss.

AB Even though desert dust is the most abundant aerosol by mass in Earth's atmosphere, the relative contributions of the world's major source regions to the global dust cycle remain poorly constrained. This problem hinders accounting for the potentially large impact of regional differences in dust properties on clouds, the Earth's energy balance, and terrestrial and marine biogeochemical cycles. Here, we constrain the contribution of each of the world's main dust source regions to the global dust cycle. We use an analytical framework that integrates an ensemble of global aerosol model simulations with observationally informed constraints on the dust size distribution, extinction efficiency, and regional dust aerosol optical depth (DAOD). We obtain a dataset that constrains the relative contribution of nine major source regions to size-resolved dust emission, atmospheric loading, DAOD, concentration, and deposition flux. We find that the 22-29 Tg (1 standard error range) global loading of dust with a geometric diameter up to 20 mu m is partitioned as follows: North African source regions contribute similar to 50% (11-15 Tg), Asian source regions contribute similar to 40% (8-13 Tg), and North American and Southern Hemisphere regions contribute similar to 10% (1.8-3.2 Tg). These results suggest that current models on average overestimate the contribution of North African sources to atmospheric dust loading at similar to 65 %, while underestimating the contribution of Asian dust at similar to 30 %. Our results further show that each source region's dust loading peaks in local spring and summer, which is partially driven by increased dust lifetime in those seasons. We also quantify the dust deposition flux to the Amazon rainforest to be similar to 10 Tg yr(-1), which is a factor of 2-3 less than inferred from satellite data by previous work that likely overestimated dust deposition by underestimating the dust mass extinction efficiency. The data obtained in this paper can be used to obtain improved constraints on dust impacts on clouds, climate, biogeochemical cycles, and other parts of the Earth system.

AB Hydrothermal vents release reduced compounds and small organic carbon compounds into the surrounding seawater, providing essential substrates for microbial growth and bioenergy transformations. Despite the wide distribution of the marine benthic group E archaea (referred to as Hydrothermarchaeota) in the hydrothermal environment, little is known about their genomic repertoires and biogeochemical significance. Here, we studied four highly complete (>80%) metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from a black smoker chimney and the surrounding sulfur-rich sediments on the South Atlantic Mid-Ocean Ridge and publicly available data sets (the Integrated Microbial Genomes system of the U.S. Department of Energy-Joint Genome Institute and NCBI SRA data sets). Genomic analysis suggested a wide carbon metabolic diversity of Hydrothermarchaeota members, including the utilization of proteins, lactate, and acetate; the anaerobic degradation of aromatics; the oxidation of C-1, compounds (CO, formate, and formaldehyde); the utilization of methyl compounds; CO2 incorporation by the tetrahydromethanopterin-based Wood-Ljungdahl pathway; and participation in the type III ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase-based Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. These microbes also potentially oxidize sulfur, arsenic, and hydrogen and engage in anaerobic respiration based on sulfate reduction and denitrification. Among the 140 MAGs reconstructed from the black smoker chimney microbial community (including Hydrothermarchaeota MAGs), community-level metabolic predictions suggested a redundancy of carbon utilization and element cycling functions and interactive syntrophic and sequential utilization of substrates. These processes might make various carbon and energy sources widely accessible to the microorganisms. Further, the analysis suggested that Hydrothermarchaeota members contained important functional components obtained from the community via lateral gene transfer, becoming a distinctive Glade. This might serve as a niche-adaptive strategy for metabolizing heavy metals, C, compounds, and reduced sulfur compounds. Collectively, the analysis provides comprehensive metabolic insights into the Hydrothermarchaeota.
   IMPORTANCE This study provides comprehensive metabolic insights into the Hydrothermarchaeota from comparative genomics, evolution, and community-level perspectives. Members of the Hydrothermarchaeota synergistically participate in a wide range of carbon-utilizing and element cycling processes with other microorganisms in the community. We expand the current understanding of community interactions within the hydrothermal sediment and chimney, suggesting that microbial interactions based on sequential substrate metabolism are essential to nutrient and element cycling.

AB The urban heat island is a vastly documented climatological phenomenon, but when it comes to coastal cities, close to desert areas, its analysis becomes extremely challenging, given the high temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity. The strong dependency on the synoptic weather conditions, rather than on city-specific, constant features, hinders the identification of recurrent patterns, leading conventional predicting algorithms to fail.
   In this paper, an advanced artificial intelligence technique based on long short-term memory (LSTM) model is applied to gain insight and predict the highly fluctuating heat island intensity (UHII) in the city of Sydney, Australia, governed by the dualistic system of cool sea breeze from the ocean and hot western winds from the vast desert biome inlands.
   Hourly measurements of temperature, collected for a period of 18 years (1999-2017) from 8 different sites in a 50 km radius from the coastline, were used to train (80%) and test (20%) the model. Other inputs included date, time, and previously computed UHII, feedbacked to the model with an optimized time step of six hours. A second set of models integrated wind speed at the reference station to account for the sea breeze effect. The R-2 ranged between 0.770 and 0.932 for the training dataset and between 0.841 and 0.924 for the testing dataset, with the best performance attained right in correspondence of the city hot spots. Unexpectedly, very little benefit (0.06-0.43%) was achieved by including the sea breeze among the input variables.
   Overall, this study is insightful of a rather rare climatological case at the watershed between maritime and desertic typicality. We proved that accurate UHII predictions can be achieved by learning from long-term air temperature records, provided that an appropriate predicting architecture is utilized. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The accurate prediction of hydrate film thickness is critical for addressing the hydrate-related issues in the fields of environment and energy resource, including the disposal of greenhouse gases into the ocean, evaluating the rising lifetime of bubble plumes in deepwater, and flow assurance problems in subsea pipelines. However, the microscopic mass-transfer mechanism in the existing hydrate film growth models has not been thoroughly studied, especially in the pore updating inside the hydrate film. In this work, an integrated mechanistic model of hydrate film growth at the gas-liquid interface is developed. Multiple mass-transfer behaviors that potentially control the thickening growth of hydrate film are considered: (i) gas diffusion and water permeation through the hydrate film; (ii) substance dissipation along the hydrate pore channels; and (iii) gas transfer between the water/hydrate interface and the surrounding fluid. In the new model, a characteristic parameter is introduced to evaluate the pore updating efficiency, which is determined by correlating with the published experimental data. Based on the numerical solution of unsteady convection diffusion equation, the gas concentration distribution in the flowing water around the hydrate film is obtained, and the mass transfer coefficients at different flow velocities are estimated correspondingly. Using the proposed model, the dynamic evolution rules of hydrate film growth at two specific conditions are investigated. The model predictions for hydrate film steady-state thickness show a good agreement with the measured results from the literature. Further, a sensitivity analysis on the growing thickness of hydrate film is performed with various influencing factors, which involves system subcooling, water flow velocity, and dissolved gas concentration in liquid water. Eventually, a case study for the scenario of the spatial and temporal changes in film thickness on a rising methane bubble in Monterey Bay Canyon is carried out. This work provides new insights into the interphase mass-transfer characteristics for hydrate dynamic growth and can serve as a useful reference for predicting the hydrate film thickness.

AB Electrifying marine routes with solar energy significantly reduces ocean carbon emissions, playing a vital role in climate regulation. Solar irradiance forecasting ensures reliable power despite unpredictable sea weather, necessitating innovative model development. This research presents a forecasting model designed for the optimal placement of solar charging stations, providing hour-ahead solar irradiance predictions for onboard solar vessels. India (Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust)- United States (Port of New York and New Jersey) sea route is selected to test our proposed forecasting model, as it aligns with busy shipping operations and long-distance trade requirements for electrification. Two distinct procedures by two case studies are used to select optimum data to predict the suitable locations for solar charging stations along the navigation route. In the first case study (Medium data analysis - MDA), the data are selected based on a statistical analysis of twenty years of hourly solar irradiance data from 201 locations. In the second case study (Large data analysis - LDA), two years of seasonal data from 201 locations are chosen and combined to form a large amount of hourly data. For both case studies, a hybrid solar irradiance forecasting model (ARIMA - Bi - LSTM) is developed by integrating the deep learning model with the time series model and fine-tuning them using optimization algorithms (PSO and GA). In MDA, the PSO optimization achieves mean absolute error (MAE) values of 0.32, 0.85, 1.83, 1.40, and 1.33 W/m(2) for locations 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively, significantly outperforming the GA, which has MAE values of 1.36, 1.65, 3.25, 0.92, and 1.41 W/m(2) for the same locations. In LDA, the PSO model achieves MAE values of 0.79, 0.91, 0.28, and 0.39 W/m(2) for winter, rain, summer, and spring, respectively, also outperforming the GA, which has MAE values of 1.54, 2.17, 0.99, and 1.46 W/m(2) for the same seasons. Comparatively, the LDA reinforces its best alignment to predict optimal charging station locations.

AB On the Arabian Platform, the Valanginian Weissert Event is associated with the sudden drowning of a major north-easterly prograding carbonate platform located on the southern margin of the Tethys Ocean. This was associated with a sharp back-stepping of the main facies belts to the south-west, bringing shallow marine carbonates into the previously restricted platform top. Integrated detailed facies analysis, biostratigraphy (including nannofossil and palynology) and carbon isotopes have been used to recon-struct the evolution of the carbonate shelf during the Valanginian-Hauterivian in Saudi Arabia. During the early Valanginian the study area was dominated by the deposition of dolomitized clay-prone mi-crobial intertidal mudstones, which passed basinwards into low-energy inner ramp limestones. These facies encompass the initial stage of a 3rd order transgressive trend above the regional Lower Val-anginian Unconformity. They are sharply overlain by Lithocodium/Bacinella-dominated floatstones, indicating the maximum flooding of the platform during the late Valanginian. These deposits system-atically increase in thickness and abundance towards the platform margin and are associated with a broad positive excursion in d13C (c. thorn 2 parts per thousand V-PDB), corresponding to the Weissert Event. The presence of abundant Lithocodium/Bacinella in strata deposited during the major flooding of the platform is consistent with higher nutrient levels and increased upwelling during the late Valanginian. The Valanginian-Hauterivian boundary is marked by a regional unconformity identified through palynology and benthic foraminifera assemblages, and locally confirmed by carbon isotopes. The combination of carbon isotope data with detailed palynology and micropaleontology provided a stratigraphic resolution in line with ammonite biozones published in the western Tethys. The Valanginian-Hauterivian conti-nental palynoflora, described for the first time on the Arabian Platform, is dominated by primitive conifer pollen such as Classopollis suggesting a rather arid climate in agreement with published reconstructions. In addition, the occurrence of various fern and bryophyte spores suggests an increase in humidity along coastline areas, associated with higher continental input into inner ramp settings, therefore affecting the carbonate factory.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Historical simulations performed for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 used biomass burning emissions between 1997 and 2014 containing higher spatial and temporal variability compared to emission inventories specified for earlier years, and compared to emissions used in previous (e.g., CMIP5) simulation intercomparisons. Using the Community Earth System Model version 2 Large Ensemble, we show this increased biomass burning emissions variability leads to amplification of the hydrologic cycle poleward of 40 degrees N. Notably, the high variability of biomass burning emissions leads to increased latent heat fluxes, column-integrated precipitable water, and precipitation. Greater ocean heat uptake, weaker meridional energy transport from the tropics, greater atmospheric shortwave and longwave absorption, and lower relative humidity act to moderate this hydrologic cycle amplification. Our results suggest it is not only the secular changes (on multidecadal timescales) in biomass burning emissions that impact the hydrologic cycle, but also the shorter timescale variability in emissions.
   Plain Language Summary Global climate models use different inputs to simulate the past climate as accurately as possible. One of these inputs is an estimate of emissions from the burning of biomass (e.g., from forests and cropland). In the sixth phase of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, the estimated biomass burning emissions were derived using two very different methods. Prior to 1997, emission estimates relied on a combination of indirect measurements and best-guess fire modeling resulting in emissions having relatively modest temporal and spatial variability. During later periods (i.e., 1997-2014) satellite based estimates of fire occurrence and intensity were used in combination with biogeochemical models to produce emission estimates containing much larger spatial and temporal variability. This study demonstrates that the differing variability in biomass burning has an impact on the model's water cycle. During years of strong burning episodes, clouds thin and more sunlight reaches the surface, which results in more surface evaporation, and higher atmospheric humidity and precipitation. Additionally, the high variation in emissions increases rainfall, decreases snowfall, and increases the intensity of extreme precipitation events. Our results show that the timing of biomass burning emissions, not just the amount emitted, is an important moderator of the atmospheric water cycle.

AB The worlds beaches are under severe pressure because of anthropogenic modification and climate change. The most common coastal management approaches have focused largely on the protection of infrastructure without considering the function of the beach and dune system as a natural protective barrier and a diverse ecosystem. Large-scale plantations of non-native vegetation have been initiated in many countries as a coastal protection tool. However, exotic trees commonly used for bio-shields, such as Casuarina equisetifolia, have been shown to have negative effects on the coastal environment, including the promotion of beach erosion in some instances and negative impacts on sea turtles. The aim of the study was to determine if exotic Casuarina spp. enhance the vulnerability of turtle nesting beaches by exacerbating erosion. The extent of use of exotic Casuarina spp. was assessed on 50 important sea turtle nesting beaches of the Indian Ocean and South-East Asia (IOSEA) region and used an adapted Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) to determine vulnerability of these beaches to erosion. Sites were assessed using long-term global data sets under four risk indicators (backshore width, beach exposure, modal beach energy, dune state) and three threat indicators (coastal development, sea-level rise and storminess). Beach vulnerability was then classified into four categories: 1) High Risk-High Threat; 2) High Risk-Low Threat; 3) Low Risk-High Threat and 4) Low Risk-Low Threat. Overall, Casuarina trees were present on 28% of beaches, and seem to be a popular management option in the IOSEA region. Lepidochelys olivacea rookeries were most affected by Casuarina, which is of concern because these populations are already considered at risk from other stressors. Overall, beaches tended to have higher risk than threat, and beaches with Casuarina present were not shown to be more vulnerable to erosion (Kruskal-Wallis X-44(2) = 42.62, p = 0.5308). However, these trees may pose other threats to sea turtles, e.g., providing obstructions to nesting females and altering nest incubation environments, which need to be carefully considered by decision makers. Ideally, natural dune cordons need to be maintained and restored, conferring benefits of protection to people, and benefits of ecological processes to biodiversity.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter that characterizes the energy balance of the land surface, and it is widely used in various research fields. This article proposes an operational split-window (SW) algorithm for use with the Chinese Fengyun-3 (FY-3) series satellite data, with the purpose of generating long-term global LST products. The algorithm primarily involves three steps. First, the brightness temperatures of the FY-3 Visible and Infrared Radiometer (VIRR) were recalibrated using historical recalibration coefficients to improve the accuracy of the absolute radiometric calibration. Second, daily dynamic emissivity maps were estimated using the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) global emissivity dataset (GED) and vegetation/snow cover products based on the vegetation cover method. Finally, the coefficients of the SW algorithm were simulated using MODTRAN 5 combined with the SeeBor V5.0 atmospheric profile library and ASTER spectral library, and then, the coefficients were stratified by the view zenith angle (VZA) and atmospheric water vapor content (WVC) to improve the fitting accuracy. The proposed SW algorithm was integrated into the MUlti-source data SYnergized Quantitative (MUSYQ) remote sensing production system to then generate FY-3 VIRR LST products. Ten land surface sites from the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER), Surface Radiation Budget (SURFRAD) networks, and nine water surface sites from the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) were used to evaluate the accuracy of the FY-3 VIRR LST products. The results demonstrated that the accuracy of the historical recalibration coefficients of the FY-3A/B VIRR is higher than that of the operational calibration coefficients for LST retrieval. The evaluation results revealed that the FY-3A VIRR LST products (2009-2013) had a bias of 0.13 K and an RMSE of 2.77 K, and the FY-3B VIRR LST products (2011-2020) had a bias of -0.07 K and an RMSE of 2.83 K. These results demonstrate that the proposed operational SW algorithm has reasonable accuracy and can be used to produce global LST products from the FY-3 VIRR data.

AB This study implemented first, second and glaciation aerosol indirect effects (AIE) on resolved clouds in the two-way coupled Weather Research and Forecasting Community Multiscale Air Quality (WRF-CMAQ) modeling system by including parameterizations for both cloud drop and ice number concentrations on the basis of CMAQ-predicted aerosol distributions and WRF meteorological conditions. The performance of the newly developed WRF-CMAQ model, with alternate Community Atmospheric Model (CAM) and Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for GCMs (RRTMG) radiation schemes, was evaluated with observations from the Clouds and the See http://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/. Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) satellite and surface monitoring networks (AQS, IMPROVE, CASTNET, STN, and PRISM) over the continental US (CONUS) (12 km resolution) and eastern Texas (4 km resolution) during August and September of 2006. The results at the Air Quality System (AQS) surface sites show that in August, the normalized mean bias (NMB) values for PM2.5 over the eastern US (EUS) and the western US (WUS) are 5.3% (-0.1%) and 0.4% (-5.2%) for WRF-CMAQ/CAM (WRF-CMAQ/RRTMG), respectively. The evaluation of PM2.5 chemical composition reveals that in August, WRF-CMAQ/CAM (WRF-CMAQ/RRTMG) consistently underestimated the observed SO42- by -23.0% (-27.7%), -12.5% (-18.9%) and -7.9% (-14.8%) over the EUS at the Clean Air Status Trends Network (CASTNET), Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) and Speciated Trends Network (STN) sites, respectively. Both configurations (WRF-CMAQ/CAM, WRF-CMAQ/RRTMG) overestimated the observed mean organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC) and and total carbon (TC) concentrations over the EUS in August at the IMPROVE sites. Both configurations generally underestimated the cloud field (shortwave cloud forcing, SWCF) over the CONUS in August due to the fact that the AIE on the subgrid convective clouds was not considered when the model simulations were run at the 12 km resolution. This is in agreement with the fact that both configurations captured SWCF and longwave cloud forcing (LWCF) very well for the 4 km simulation over eastern Texas, when all clouds were resolved by the finer resolution domain. The simulations of WRF-CMAQ/CAM and WRF-CMAQ/RRTMG show dramatic improvements for SWCF, LWCF, cloud optical depth (COD), cloud fractions and precipitation over the ocean relative to those of WRF default cases in August. The model performance in September is similar to that in August, except for a greater overestimation of PM2.5 due to the overestimations of SO42-, NH4+, NO3-, and TC over the EUS, less underestimation of clouds (SWCF) over the land areas due to the lower SWCF values, and fewer convective clouds in September. This work shows that inclusion of indirect aerosol effect treatments in WRF-CMAQ represents a significant advancement and milestone in air quality modeling and the development of integrated emissions control strategies for air quality management and climate change mitigation.

AB Ocean-land thermal feedback mechanisms in the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) domain are an important but not well understood component of regional climate dynamics. Here we present a O-18 record analyzed in the mixed-layer dwelling planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber (sensu stricto) from the northernmost Bay of Bengal (BoB). The O-18 time series provides a spatially integrated measure of monsoonal precipitation and Himalayan meltwater runoff into the northern BoB and reveals two brief episodes of anomalously low O-18 values between 16.30.4 and 160.5 and 12.60.4 and 12.30.4 thousand years before present. The timing of these events is centered at Heinrich event 1 and the Younger Dryas, well-known phases of weak northern hemisphere monsoon systems. Numerical climate model experiments, simulating Heinrich event-like conditions, suggest a surface warming over the monsoon-dominated Himalaya and foreland in response to ISM weakening. Corroborating the simulation results, our analysis of published moraine exposure ages in the monsoon-dominated Himalaya indicates enhanced glacier retreats that, considering age model uncertainties, coincide and overlap with the episodes of anomalously low O-18 values in the northernmost BoB. Our climate proxy and simulation results provide insights into past regional climate dynamics, suggesting reduced cloud cover, increased solar radiation, and air warming of the Himalaya and foreland areas and, as a result, glacier mass losses in response to weakened ISM.
   Plain Language Summary Indian Summer Monsoon rainfall and Himalayan glacier/snow melts constitute the main water source for the densely populated Indian subcontinent. Better understanding of how future climate changes will affect the monsoon rainfall and Himalayan glaciers requires a long climate record. In this study, we create a 13,000-year-long climate record that allows us to better understand the response of Indian Summer Monsoon rainfall and Himalayan glaciers to past climate changes. The focus of our study is the time window between 9,000 and 22,000 years ago, an episode where the global climate experienced large and rapid changes. Our sediment record from the northern Bay of Bengal and climate change simulation indicate that during episodes of weak monsoon, the melting of the Himalayan glaciers increases substantially significantly. This is because the weakening of the monsoon results in less cloud cover and, as a result, the surface receives more sunlight and causes glacier melting.

AB Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 325 cored submerged reefs along the shelf edge of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) to study sea-level and environmental changes and their impacts on reef communities and reef growth since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Previous work defined five reef sequences (Reef 1-5) that span the last 30,000 years. Here we examined the variation in coralgal assemblages and their paleoenvironmental settings in late glacial to deglacial sequences from 23 holes cored seaward of the modern GBR in water depths from 46 to 131 m along four transects at three localities: Hydrographers Passage (HYD-01C and HYD-02A), Noggin Pass (NOG-01B), and Ribbon Reef (RIB-02A). We identified three coralline algal assemblages and eight coral assemblages indicating a broad range of reef settings from the shallow reef crest (0-5 m) to the deep forereef slope (> 20 m). We document in detail for the first time the distribution and composition of reef communities that grew in the GBR during the LGM from 22,000-19,000 years ago. They included coral taxa that are major reef builders today: Isopora, Acropora gr. humilis, Dipsastraea gr. pallida, Porites, and Montipora. Prior to the fall in sea level to the maximum extent of the LGM, late glacial reef communities developed more proximally (landward) to the modern GBR along the shelf edge. Their distribution and composition reflect influences of the older Pleistocene basement depth and possible terrigenous sediment inputs. Post-LGM deglacial reef growth was vigorous in proximal sites and characterized by the accretion of a very shallow high-energy coralgal assemblage composed of medium to robustly branching Acropora, including A. gr. humilis, and thick algal crusts of Porolithon gr. onkodes associated with vermetid gastropods. More distally, reef growth was variably impacted by terrigenous input following deglacial reflooding of antecedent reef terraces. The coralgal succession and sedimentary facies in Noggin Pass indicate that an early drowning trend was linked to increased turbidity that was likely controlled by shelf morphology (narrow shelf, steep slope) and/or proximity to a paleo-river mouth. The deglacial succession in Ribbon Reef lacks typical shallow-water indicators, which may reflect influences of the particularly steep slope of the northern GBR shelf edge on reef zonation. A major sea-level jump at the onset of the Younger Dryas displaced reef habitats further upslope, forming a barrier reef system mainly composed of robustly branching acroporids distinct from the more distal sites. Our results highlight the importance of sedimentation and shelf morphology in addition to relative sea-level changes in controlling variations in reef community over centennial to millennial timescales.

AB Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are large contributors to fine particle mass loading and number concentration and interact with clouds and radiation. Several processes affect the formation, chemical transformation, and removal of SOA in the atmosphere. For computational efficiency, global models use simplified SOA treatments, which often do not capture the dynamics of SOA formation. Here we test more complex SOA treatments within the global Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) to investigate how simulated SOA spatial distributions respond to some of the important but uncertain processes affecting SOA formation, removal, and lifetime. We evaluate model predictions with a suite of surface, aircraft, and satellite observations that span the globe and the full troposphere. Simulations indicate that both a strong production (achieved here by multigenerational aging of SOA precursors that includes moderate functionalization) and a strong sink of SOA (especially in the middle upper troposphere, achieved here by adding particle-phase photolysis) are needed to reproduce the vertical distribution of organic aerosol (OA) measured during several aircraft field campaigns; without this sink, the simulated middle upper tropospheric OA is too large. Our results show that variations in SOA chemistry formulations change SOA wet removal lifetime by a factor of 3 due to changes in horizontal and vertical distributions of SOA. In all the SOA chemistry formulations tested here, an efficient chemical sink, that is, particle-phase photolysis, was needed to reproduce the aircraft measurements of OA at high altitudes. Globally, SOA removal rates by photolysis are equal to the wet removal sink, and photolysis decreases SOA lifetimes from 10 to similar to 3 days. A recent review of multiple field studies found no increase in net OA formation over and downwind biomass burning regions, so we also tested an alternative, empirical SOA treatment that increases primary organic aerosol (POA) emissions near source region and converts POA to SOA with an aging time scale of 1 day. Although this empirical treatment performs surprisingly well in simulating OA loadings near the surface, it overestimates OA loadings in the middle and upper troposphere compared to aircraft measurements, likely due to strong convective transport to high altitudes where wet removal is weak. The default improved model formulation (multigenerational aging with moderate fragmentation and photolysis) performs much better than the empirical treatment in these regions. Differences in SOA treatments greatly affect the SOA direct radiative effect, which ranges from -0.65 (moderate fragmentation and photolysis) to -2 W m(-2) (moderate fragmentation without photolysis). Notably, most SOA formulations predict similar global indirect forcing of SOA calculated as the difference in cloud forcing between present-day and preindustrial simulations.
   Plain language Summary Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are formed in the atmosphere by oxidation of organic gases emitted from natural biogenic, anthropogenic, and biomass burning sources. In many regions of the atmosphere, SOA greatly contributes to fine particle mass loadings and number concentrations and affects clouds and radiation. Integrating insights from global atmospheric modeling and measurements, we show that strong chemical production achieved here by multigenerational chemistry including moderate fragmentation of SOA precursors and strong chemical sinks represented by particle-phase photolysis are needed to explain the aircraft-observed vertical profiles of SOA over multiple regions including North America, equatorial oceans, and the Southern Ocean. Photolysis reduces simulated global SOA lifetimes from 10 to 3 days. Within the same model physics and cloud treatments, we show that changes in SOA chemistry formulations change SOA wet removal lifetimes by a factor of 3. Simulations show that SOA exerts a strong direct radiative forcing in the present day ranging from -0.65 to -2 Wm(-2). Future measurements and modeling are needed to better constrain the photolytic and heterogeneous chemical removal of SOA at high-altitude atmospheric conditions.
